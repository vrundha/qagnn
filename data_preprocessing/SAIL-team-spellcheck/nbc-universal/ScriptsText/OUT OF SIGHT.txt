     Lola exits her apartment, pulls a bobby pin from her hair

     hand it to the fugitive, Russ's hand moves to her ass. When

     until his hand lands on cold steel in a thigh holster.

     EXT. POOL HALL / INT. KAREN'S CAR - DAY

     Jack obediently rounds his own car and slides into the
     passenger seat of Karen's. She drives down the block, the




                                R
     eyes of the TOUGH CUSTOMERS following them as she turns the
     corner, pulls over within view of THE OCEAN. She parks, turns
     the car off, turns to look at Jack. A long beat of silence.




                             ZA
     In their looks, we sense the three years of longing these
     two have experienced for each other - and also the tragedy
     between them. A crook and a Fed who can never be together.

                           JACK




                           TA
               You should probably get that looked
               at.

     Karen glances down and sees blood spreading from where her
     wound has opened up. She ignores the question --
                         ALKAREN
               Why "The Long Good-Bye?" I mean it's
               Chandler, but 1973? The others were
               all classics.

                            JACK

               One good line.

     Karen looks at him, almost smiles, she knows which one --

               'To say good-bye is to die a little.'

                   (so good)
               I mean come on.

               You think that's true?

                           JACK
               Not always. Sometimes you die a lot.

     Karen nods, inhales, speaks the hard truth --

                           KAREN
               You know I'm gonna have to arrest
               you.

               Know who we're like? Ralph and Sam.

               That cartoon. The wolf and the
               sheepdog? They clock in, chase each
               other all day, and then end of day




                             R
               they punch out, walk home together.
               'Evening Ralph.' 'Evening, Sam.'
                   (he looks at her)




                          ZA
               Who's to say this time we don't just
               walk home together?

     Karen considers, changes the subject, priorities --

                           KAREN




                        TA
               You really have her somewhere safe?

                           JACK
               Yeah. And I think she wants to
               testify, she's just scared.
                      AL   KAREN
               She should be. The guy who came after
               her doesn't fit the motive of the
               bangers who killed her friends.
               There's something bigger going on.

                           JACK

               And if somebody in your own office
               gave Lola up--

               Love. Right.

               From where I'm sitting? You've got a
               pretty short list of people you can
               trust. And believe me, I'd be sitting

               anywhere but here if I wasn't one of
               them.

     Karen looks at him again, still weighing his honesty --

                           KAREN
               I need a number for you. When I call
               it, you pick up or I get a call back
               within five minutes. Day or night.

               I can do that.

               Good. Because if you don't I will
               immediately initiate a manhunt.

               If you see any perceived threat to
               Lola's safety, if her location is
               compromised, you do not handle it

               I'll take that as a maybe.

     Jack grins, loves getting the last word, turns and... gets
     PUNCHED full in the face. He drops.

     Karen turns to exit and help and... she's PUNCHED through

     INT. KAREN'S CAR - TRUNK - MOMENTS LATER

     FROM BLACK -- the sound of a car starting. A RED BRAKE light
     casts an eery glow that REVEALS Karen, waking up in the trunk
     of her own car, dazed. Jack is out cold, next to her.

               Jack. Jack, wake up.

     Jack's eyes open. He works his aching jaw. His tongue tastes
     blood. Ouch. The car lurches forward. Karen tries to kick
     the drunk door. BAM. BAM. No good. Jack, still dazed, says --
                       AL  JACK
               I remember this being more romantic.

                           KAREN
