INT. BEDROOM - 1994 - MORNING

A 7-year-old boy, GREG YOUNG, pops out of bed, excited. He
runs to his desk, grabs a pencil, then marks his height on
the wall.

He hears some LOUD NOISES down the hall. Curious, he creeps
towards the door when suddenly, his 10 year old sister, JUNE,
BURSTS into his room and shuts the door with urgency!

                    GREG
          What are you doing?

                    JUNE
          You have to listen to me. This is
          serious. I’m only telling you this
          because you’re seven now and you’re
          old enough to know the truth.

                    GREG
          Okay...

                    JUNE
              (pointing)
          That’s not what you think it is.

                    GREG
          My toy chest?

                    JUNE
          It’s actually... a portal.

                    GREG
          Pfft. No way.
              (then; curious)
          To where?

June starts dumping all the toys out of the chest.

                    JUNE
          I’ve only used it once and it took
          me to the North Pole. Maybe it goes
          other places too - I only know for
          sure it goes there.

Greg stares at the toy chest, his heart pounding. Then he
runs to his CLOSET.

                    JUNE (CONT’D)
          What are you doing?

Greg pulls out a WINTER COAT.
                                                         2.


                    GREG
          It’s the North Pole.

                    JUNE
          Duh! Wish I had thought of that
          when I went. Now hurry!

Greg quickly climbs into the toy chest.

                    JUNE (CONT’D)
          Okay. When I close this, you need
          to count to five but most
          importantly, you need to believe.

Greg nods and June closes the toy chest. WE STAY IN GREG’S
POV INSIDE THE DARK AND CONFINING TOY CHEST.

                    GREG
          Nothing’s happening! I’m just
          getting hot.

                    JUNE (O.S.)
          Weird! Maybe try to believe more!

Greg tries again. Nothing. Frustrated, he tries to push open
the toy chest only to realize he’s locked in. He starts
POUNDING to get out but it’s no use. He panics.

                    GREG
          JUNE! LET ME OUT! JUNE!

Then the Offspring’s “Keep Em Separated” starts BLARING AT
FULL BLAST. It’s torture. Greg bangs on the lid like he’s
trying to get out of a coffin. His SCREAMS MORPH into the
SCREAM OF AN ADULT-


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

GREG (now in his 30s) wakes up SCREAMING, in a cold sweat.
His wife NICOLE (30s), who is sleeping face-to-face with him,
is startled awake and screams right in his face:

                    NICOLE
          AHHHHH!! Seriously?! Again?

                    GREG
          Sorry. I can’t control my mind when
          I sleep. I’m not Freddy Krueger.

                    NICOLE
          Freddy controlled other people’s
          minds when they slept, not his own.
          I don’t even think he slept.
                                                            3.


3:02am. They both groan, trying to get back to sleep. Then-

                     AARON (O.S.)
          I’m wet.

                     GREG/NICOLE
          AHHHHH!!

Their 4-year-old AARON is standing at the foot of their bed,
horror-movie style. Nicole rolls over.

                    NICOLE
          I did it last time.

Greg GROANS and gets up.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BOYS’ BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Greg, half-asleep, strips the sheets, and flips the mattress -
- there are pee stains everywhere.

                    GREG
          This mattress looks like a
          giraffe’s neck.

                    AARON
          Can we go to the zoo tomorrow?

                    GREG
              (tucking Aaron in)
          No. Go back to sleep.

                    AARON
          I’m thirsty.

                    GREG
          That’s how we got into this mess in
          the first place. Love you.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

It’s 4:01am. Greg and Nicole are fast asleep again.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I had a bad dream.

Their other son, ANDREW (5) is now standing by their bed.

                    ANDREW (CONT’D)
          Can I sleep with you?

Andrew climbs in bed and clings onto his mom.
                                                         4.


                    NICOLE
          Can you move over a bit? And maybe
          loosen the choke-hold?

                    ANDREW
          No. The Chupacabra will eat my
          feet.

Andrew gets in a position where he’s splayed across the bed,
clinging to Nicole with his feet kicking Greg’s back. Neither
of them will be sleeping tonight.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - MORNING

The house is a mess. Chipped paint and magic markers on
walls, scratches on floors, toys everywhere. Greg and Nicole
look utterly exhausted as they prepare breakfast, clean-up
after the boys, fold laundry, etc. Once the plates are on the
table, Greg sits down to review PAPERWORK.

                    ANDREW
          3-2-1! THE FLOOR IS LAVA!

Andrew and Aaron dive onto the couch and climb on furniture,
knocking over Nicole’s neat laundry piles.

                    NICOLE
          Awww come on, man. My piles.

                    AARON
          The floor was lava.

                    NICOLE
          Greg, you want to attempt to be
          useful here?

                    GREG
          Boys. Food’s on the table. Eat.

The boys ignore him and continue playing. Greg looks at her -
he tried.

                    NICOLE
          Okay, you have 5 seconds to get to
          the table or you never get to eat
          breakfast again.

                    ANDREW
          Race you to the table!

The boys race to the table and knock over a cup of milk. Some
of it SPILLS on Greg’s paperwork. He quickly grabs them.
                                                         5.


                    GREG
          NO! My inspection report- Do you
          see what you did?!

                    ANDREW
          Yeah.

                    GREG
          Do you even care?!

They don’t. Frustrated, Greg pins the dripping papers up on
the fridge with an OLD FRIDGE MAGNET (that features a much
younger Greg and Nicole as real estate partners).

                    AARON
          Mom. Can I have more milk?

                    NICOLE
          There isn’t any more.

                    AARON
          BUT I WANT MILK!

Nicole sees Aaron is on the brink of tears and
enthusiastically tries a different tact.

                    NICOLE
          Boys! This is math! Aaron had 1
          milk, then he lost 1 milk, so now
          there’s 0 milk. But what if Aaron
          had 2 milks, and then spilled just
          1 of them? Then how many milks
          would Aaron have left?

                    AARON
              (bursting out in tears)
          I waaaaaant miiiiiilk!

                    NICOLE
          Ugh. We really need to get these
          guys into pre-school. They’re not
          learning anything here.

                    GREG
          Do you not see me working on it?

                    NICOLE
          I didn’t mean it like that.

This is a touchy subject. The moment is interrupted by Andrew
teasing Aaron which then escalates to PUSHING AND FIGHTING.

                    GREG
          No closed fists! Slappers only!
                                                         6.


They roll on the ground, wrestling.

                    NICOLE
          Guys! GUYS! If you’re gonna roll on
          the floor at least roll over the
          milk and help me out.

                    ANDREW
          Ahhhhh! Aaron bit me!

                    NICOLE
          STOP FIGHTING EACH OTHER! WHY WON’T
          YOU JUST LISTEN?!

Both boys cry harder after being yelled at. At the peak of
the stress level, Greg announces:

                    GREG
          You know what, I’m gonna print
          these at the office. See you
          tonight. Love you!

Greg’s out the door before Nicole can even respond. Numb to
the boys’ crying, she starts cleaning up the spill.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

JUNE OLSEN (40s, Greg’s sister from the flashback) lays in
bed, staring up at the ceiling. She looks troubled. Her
husband RANDALL (40s) sleeps beside her. She gets up.


INT. OLSENS HOUSE - GARAGE/ART STUDIO - SOON AFTER

June paints on a canvass, now looking calmer and more
relaxed, as if this was a form of therapy.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MORNING

June and Randall sit across from each other at the breakfast
table, reading the newspaper, not engaging in conversation.
Their son, MARTY (11) joins them.

                    MARTY
          Oh. They evacuated Ventura County.
          Wildfires are getting closer.

June and Randall look at each other, confused, then realize
Marty read the headline from the back of the newspaper he’s
holding. Randall folds the paper and tucks it away.
                                                           7.


                    RANDALL
          It’s okay. We’re nowhere near a
          burn zone. We won’t be affected.

                    MARTY
          We’re affected by the air quality.

                    JUNE
          You don’t have to worry about stuff
          like air, honey. You’re young and
          healthy.

                    MARTY
          What about the two of you though?

                    JUNE
          We’re fine. We’re healthy as
          horses.

                    MARTY
          Horses die all the time. At Santa
          Anita race track it’s happening in
          record numbers.

                    RANDALL
          Fine. We’re healthier than horses.
          Hey, how about you go play some
          video games, huh?

                    MARTY
          Really? Before school?

                    RANDALL
          Sure! Why not?
              (Marty leaves)
          So much for reading newspapers
          around him.

Their 13-year-old daughter AMY walks in and starts making a
smoothie, not acknowledging either of her parents.

               JUNE                    RANDALL (CONT'D)
Morning Amy.                    Morning honey.

No response. They look at each other, give a wink and a nod.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          Hey, uh, Amy...

Amy rolls her eyes, as if even the sound of their voices
makes her nauseous.
                                                8.


                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          ...you might wanna check your bag
          there. I think there’s something
          sticking out of it.

                    AMY
          Were you going through my things?

                    JUNE
          Just look at the bag.

Amy pulls out the 4 TICKETS from her bag.

                    AMY
          Disneyland?

                    RANDALL
          We thought it’d be fun for all of
          us to go for your birthday!
          Happiest place on earth!

                    AMY
          Yeah, for kids. I want to go to
          Coachella for my birthday.

                    RANDALL
          Coachella. I guess we could rent an
          RV and go camping in Joshua tree-

                    AMY
          Not with you. With my friends.
          Jasmine’s Dad is a concert
          promoter, he can get us VIP passes.

                    JUNE
          Oh great. Jasmine’s dad. The guy
          who bought his daughter a vape pen
          for Christmas?

                    RANDALL
          I guess getting your daughter cool
          things but never actually being
          around makes you father-of-the-year
          now?

                    AMY
          Yes.

Randall is clearly hurt by this.

                    JUNE
          Amy, you’re 13 and you’re obviously
          not going to Coachella.
                                                9.


Amy crosses her arms; this is so unfair.

                    RANDALL
          But! How about we do a Coachella-
          themed birthday party in our
          backyard and invite all your
          friends!

                    JUNE
          Oh, great idea! We can get
          wristbands, body glitter, uhh...

                    RANDALL
          Port-o-pottys! We’ll get the set
          lists and play the music by the
          artists! It’ll feel like you’re
          really at Coachella... without all
          the inherent risks.

                    AMY
          But I won’t be at Coachella. I’ll
          be in backyard. With my parents.
          While my friends are at the actual
          Coachella, having actual fun.

                    JUNE
          We get that you’re frustrated. It’s
          just, there’s so many bad people at
          Coachella. So many bad people.

                    AMY
          So you’re basically saying you
          don’t trust me.

                    JUNE
          Of course we do. We just don’t
          trust the 99,000 other people.

                    RANDALL
          Look, the same thing happened to me
          when I was your age and my parents
          wouldn’t let me go to a Cars
          concert because they weren’t sure
          about some of the themes in Rick
          Ocasik’s music-

                    AMY
          Are you really comparing The Cars
          to Frank Ocean and Dababy?

                    RANDALL
          No. Because I don’t know who those
          people are.
                                                          10.


                    JUNE
          Did you say “The Baby”? I don’t
          wanna sound out of touch but is
          there an actual baby performing at
          this festival?

                    AMY
          I knew you guys would react like
          this! Why are you doing this to
          me?! I HATE YOU!!

Amy grabs her bag and storms out of the room.

                       RANDALL
          ... I see.

Randall calmly picks up his plate and gets up from the table.

- HIS MIND FLASHES TO THE FIRST TIME HE HELD AMY IN THE
HOSPITAL WHEN SHE WAS BORN.

Randall brushes his food scraps into the compost bin...

- THE FIRST TIME AMY SAID “DADA” AS AN INFANT.

Randall turns on the sink, starts doing the dishes...

- AMY TAKING HER FIRST STEPS AND FALLING INTO HIS ARMS.

- AMY LEARNING HOW TO RIDE A BIKE.

- AMY BEING DROPPED OFF AT HER FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN.

- AMY LOOKING RANDALL DEAD IN THE EYE:

                    AMY
          I HATE YOU!!!

Randall drops the dish in the sink and breaks down crying.

                    RANDALL
          She hates me.

                    JUNE
          Hey, hey, she hates “us”. I said
          the same thing to my parents when I
          was her age.

                    RANDALL
          But you actually hate your parents.
                                                           11.


                    JUNE
          And they always said they hoped
          this would happen to me when I had
          kids. God, I hate them so much.
              (checking the time)
          Shit, I have to be at the studio.
          You gonna be okay?

                    RANDALL
          Yeah... I’ll be fine.

                    JUNE
          Okay, just- try not to take it so
          hard. Normal teenage stuff.

June hugs Randall goodbye and then leaves. He continues doing
the dishes, then breaks down crying again.


INT. JUNE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

June buckles up, is about to drive, but puts it back in PARK.
Clearly Amy’s words sting more than she lets on. She takes a
moment to collect herself, then drives off.


INT. MENDELSON HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE ON Greg’s blissfully sleeping face. We PULL BACK to
reveal he’s lying on a couch in his suit. We PULL BACK
FURTHER to reveal TWO PEOPLE standing over him.

                     WOMAN (O.S.)
          Wake up!

Greg is jolted awake to find his clients MR. and MRS.
MENDELSON (60’s) gawking at him. He’s still half-asleep.

                    GREG
          MENDELSONS!! I have your inspection
          report. Don’t worry, it’s dry. I
          was just power-napping. Feeling
          very powerful at the moment-
              (grabbing his neck)
          Owwww. Little crink. It’s fine. So,
          shall we review?

He gets up and there’s a NOTICEABLE DROOL PUDDLE on the
cushion. Greg flips the cushion over.

                    GREG (CONT’D)
          I do that all the time at home.

The Mendelsons look very displeased with this man.
                                                          12.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - DAY

Nicole and the boys PAINT. It’s everywhere. Bored, Aaron
stops and grabs a Nerf Gun. Then Andrew stops and joins him.

                    NICOLE
          You’re done? We just started
          painting five minutes ago... fine.
          Can you please at least help me
          clean up before you move on to the
          next activity?

                    ANDREW
          We don’t want to.

                    NICOLE
          I know you don’t want to. But
          sometimes when you love somebody
          you do things you don’t want to
          just to help them out and make them
          feel like they exist.

Andrew stares at his mom. Is she getting through to him? Then-

                    ANDREW
          Wakanda Forever!

He unloads his Nerf Gun on Aaron. Aaron runs away, laughing
and knocks over some open paints, splattering the walls.

                    NICOLE
          Okay! Time to leave the house!


INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY - LATER

As Nicole grabs some milk, the boys fight over the cart and
RAM it into the back of an ELDERLY SHOPPER’S legs.

                    ELDERLY SHOPPER
          OW!

The Elderly Shopper falls to the ground, clutching her leg.
Nicole rushes over to help.

                    NICOLE
          Oh my god I’m so sorry!

The Elderly Shopper is badly hurt, not ready to get up.

                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          Boys, what do you say?
                                                        13.


                    ANDREW
          Aaron did it.

                    AARON
          No I didn’t!

Andrew pushes Aaron and he trips over the Elderly Shopper’s
legs. Nicole physically separates them as CUSTOMERS gather to
watch this train wreck. She is mortified.

                    NICOLE
          Okay! Time to go back home!


INT. MINIVAN - DAY - LATER

Nicole drives as the boys fight over an iPad. Numb, she stops
outside of A PRESCHOOL with an OPEN ENROLLMENT SIGN. She
stares longingly at the throngs of kids in the yard. Then,
the car behind her honks and she keeps driving.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER

Nicole locks the door, sits on the toilet. Finally, a moment
of peace and quiet. Then, she hears the boys looking for her,
calling out “MOM” over and over. She says nothing, hoping it
will stop. The “MOM” “MOM” MOM” gets closer and closer until
both boys are outside the bathroom door, rattling the door
knob trying to get in. Nicole puts her head in her hands.


I/E. YOUNG HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Greg parks and looks up the house, not eager to go inside. He
enters and sees the house is a sty, paint on the walls.

                    GREG
          There’s paint everywhere. Why would
          you let them paint?

Nicole walks in looking extremely frazzled.

                    NICOLE
          Why would I let them paint? Because
          they had to do something! They’ve
          been all over me all day. You don’t
          know what it’s like.

                    GREG
          I have some idea what it’s like.

                    NICOLE
          What’d you have for lunch today?
                                                        14.


                    GREG
          I don’t see why that’s relevant.
          But... a turkey club.

                    NICOLE
          You know what I had for lunch?
          NOTHING! I picked at the remains of
          the kids’ plates like a bird at the
          beach. I’m on a goddamn seagull’s
          diet. So if you think you have the
          right to complain about the mess or
          what I let the kids do-

                    GREG
          I don’t! I won’t! I’m sorry!

                    NICOLE
              (deep breath)
          I’m sorry. Today was rough. I know
          we only have a few months of this,
          but I don’t know how I’m going to
          survive it. How was your day?

This is the one question Greg was hoping she wouldn’t ask.

                     GREG
          Uhhhh. You know, pretty uneventful.
              (then)
          I’m mean, not totally uneventful. I
          guess there was one event worth
          mentioning...

                    NICOLE
          Why are you being so coy?
              (suddenly hopeful)
          Did you sell the Mendelson house?!

                    GREG
          I should not have tee’d it up like
          that. You know I love you, right?

                    NICOLE
          Oh no. Don’t say that.

                    GREG
          The Mendelsons sort of decided to
          go... in a different direction...
          with me. Or without me.
                                                        15.


                    NICOLE
              (gutted)
          So the Mendelson house - the one
          you said could sell itself, the one
          that’s supposed to pay for
          preschool - is gone? Which means
          I’m stuck at home with the kids now
          indefinitely?

Greg sees how upset Nicole is and feels ashamed.

                    GREG
          I’m sorry. I just don’t get any
          sleep at night and then when I’m at
          work I can’t think too good. Maybe
          if I didn’t have to get up multiple
          times a night-

                    NICOLE
          Oh, so I should be the one getting
          up with them all night and then
          also be the only one that looks
          after them all day?!

                    AARON (O.S.)
          MOM!

                    GREG
          I’ll take care of this.
              (calling out)
          Boys, what do you want?

                    AARON
          We want mom.

Nicole walks away, devastated. Greg feels like a failure.


INT. OFFICE - RANDALL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Randall is on a boring conference call, barely listening. His
eyes fall on a framed FAMILY PHOTO of when the kids were much
younger. They all looked so happy and together.


INT. ART STUDIO - LATER

June paints between TWO SEPARATE ART PIECES that we don’t
see, bouncing between them, passionate, TEARS ARE STREAMING
DOWN HER FACE. Then- her phone RINGS and snaps her out of it.
She quickly wipes away her tears and answers cheerfully:
                                                          16.


                    JUNE
          Hi hun.

                                              INTERCUT WITH:


INT. RANDALL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Randall is driving home, shopping bags beside him.

                    RANDALL
          Hey! Just picked up stuff to make
          pot roast. Thought we could all use
          a family dinner. What time you
          think you’re home?

                    JUNE
          Oh... sorry. I really need to stay
          here and work tonight. Could we do
          it tomorrow instead?

                    RANDALL
          I have basketball Friday.

                    JUNE
          Right. And my brother’s coming over
          Saturday.

Sort of an awkward silence.

                    RANDALL
          K, no prob. I’ll just have dinner
          with the kids. Have a good night!

Randall hangs up, more than a little disappointed.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING

Randall finishes setting the table for dinner.

                    RANDALL
          Kids! Dinner!


INT. OLSENS HOUSE - AMY’S ROOM - SOON AFTER

Randall knocks on Amy’s door.

                    RANDALL
          Amy? Dinner’s on the table.

                    AMY (O.S.)
          I’m not hungry.
                                                           17.


                    RANDALL
          Okay. It’s just a lot of food.

                    AMY (O.S.)
          I literally just told you I’m not
          hungry.

                    RANDALL
          Alright! It’ll just be a boy’s
          night then.


INT. OLSENS HOUSE - MARTY’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Randall opens Marty’s door and sees him watching Twitch.

                    RANDALL
          Marty, hope you’re hungry.

                    MARTY
          Starving. But can you bring it
          here? I’m watching a friend watch
          someone play a videogame.

                    RANDALL
          Watching your friend watch a- why?
              (giving up)
          Okay. I’ll bring some up.


INT. OLSEN’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - SOON AFTER

Randall sits alone, sadly eating pot roast in the dark.


EXT. OLSEN’S HOUSE - TWO DAYS LATER - AFTERNOON

The YOUNG FAMILY pulls up to the house. Greg gets out, looks
to the house, takes a deep breath, before he opens the door.

                    GREG
          Hey! We’re here!


INT. OLSEN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Andrew and Aaron run in to greet Aunt June and Uncle Randall,
who are just as excited to receive actual love from a kid.

                    GREG
          Huh. A hug. Can’t remember the last
          time I got a greeting like that.
                                                        18.


                    RANDALL
          Here, I’ll give you one of those.

Randall pulls Greg in for a warm hug. Then, Greg and June
give each other and a more perfunctory hug. It’s awkward.


EXT. OLSEN’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER

June pours Nicole some wine. She needs it.

                    JUNE
          Another year, huh?

                    NICOLE
          Yup.

REVERSE to see they’re staring at the boys, who are taking
dirt from the garden and pouring it on their heads.

                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          So what’s it like not having kids
          crawling over you all the time?

                    JUNE
              (tinge of sadness)
          It’s... quiet.

                    NICOLE
          Quiet... that sounds incredible.

They take generous sips, lost in their own thoughts.


EXT. OLSEN’S HOUSE - BBQ - CONTINUOUS

Randall and Greg are at the grill, cooking burgers. Marty
walks over with a plate of buns.

                    GREG
          Marty, how’s school going?

                    MARTY
          Pretty good. We had a lock-down
          drill yesterday and it was our best
          time yet, so hopefully that will
          limit casualties if there’s ever a
          school shooting.

                    GREG
          Wow. That’s terrible you even have
          to think about that.

Randall starts aggressively flipping burgers, uncomfortable.
                                                        19.


                    MARTY
          Although if the shooter was a
          student from our school, the drills
          might be helping them, because
          they’d know the procedure, where to
          find everyone, the exit routes-

                    RANDALL
          ALRIGHT EVERYBODY SIT DOWN! BURGERS
          ARE DONE!

Greg leans over the BBQ to check the RARE BURGERS.

                      GREG
          Are they?


EXT. OLSEN’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - SOON AFTER

Both families sit at the table, chatting. Nobody has touched
the burgers. The boys are still PLAYING LOUDLY in the dirt,
and it’s bothering Greg. He leans over to Nicole.

                    GREG
          Hey, the boys are being a bit-

                    NICOLE
          I don’t care.

                      GREG
          Got it.

Nicole turns to Amy, who clearly doesn’t want to be there.

                    NICOLE
          Thanks for giving us one of your
          Saturday nights, Amy.

                    AMY
          Oh it’s no problem. I’m not allowed
          to have a social life anyway.

                    NICOLE
          Well if it makes you feel any
          better, I don’t have one either.

                    GREG
          Hey boys! We’re eating! Can you
          join us at the table?

                    ANDREW
          We can’t! We’re baking a cake!
                                                        20.


                    GREG
          Okay, can you just bake it a little
          quieter? Heh, heh.

The boys continue playing at the same level. Annoyed, Greg
walks over to them, kneels down to make his plea:

                    GREG (CONT’D)
          Guys, seriously. We’re at someone
          else’s house right now. I need you
          to just listen to me-

Aaron SQUAWKS right in Greg’s face and continues playing. No
respect. Greg rejoins the table and June smirks at him.

                    JUNE
          How’d that go?

                    GREG
              (stewing)
          Oh, you know...

                    RANDALL
          It’s fine, they’re just excited
          kids. They’re not bothering
          anybody. They’re laughing.

                    GREG
          Well if it doesn’t bother you, it
          doesn’t bother me.

Greg continues eating though clearly this bothers him a lot.

                    NICOLE
          Your tomato garden looks great.

                    JUNE
          Thanks. I laid some plastic down on
          the soil before planting to warm it
          up. And I always use red mulch...

Greg nods, pretending to listen. But all he can focus on is
the boys making noise. Again, he gets up from the table.

                    JUNE (O.C.) (CONT’D)
          Tomatoes love heat and the mulch
          really helps to retain the moisture
          in the soil...

Greg walks to the boys, offers them an iPad. This time they
comply and quietly enter the house. Back at the table, June
has clocked this transaction.
                                                        21.


                    NICOLE
          Huh. So that’s what mulch does.
          Never really thought that mulch
          about much-
              (correcting)
          - that much about mulch.

June and Nicole laugh, both buzzed. Greg returns to the
table. And June gives him the slightest of shit-eating grins.

                      GREG
          What?

                    JUNE
          Nothing. Just an interesting time
          to reward them with screens. Unless
          your goal was to reinforce the
          exact behavior you were trying to
          stop?

                    GREG
              (defensive)
          It was actually. That was the goal
          that I set, and I achieved it.

                    JUNE
          Relax! I was just joking.

                      GREG
          So was I.

Everyone laughs to get past this awkward moment.

                    RANDALL
          Summer corn! Is there anything
          better?
              (then; ashamed)
          Sorry about the burgers.


EXT. OLSEN’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

Only adults at the table now and everyone’s even drunker.

                    GREG
          She said she hates you? Oof.

The wound is still fresh for Randall.

                    GREG (CONT’D)
          I remember the first time you said
          that to mom.
                                                22.


                    JUNE
          Yeah, but mom deserved it. She
          wouldn’t buy me that... I don’t
          remember what it was, but she
          deserved it.

                    NICOLE
          At least you have a daughter. I
          would love a daughter. I’m
          surrounded by boys. Just me in a
          house full of nutsacks. Honestly,
          even the thought of a nutsack at
          this point, repulses me.

Greg self-consciously crosses his legs.

                    JUNE
          You know what eventually happens to
          daughters? They develop self-esteem
          issues, body image issues... and
          they have a right to. Their bodies
          and faces look straight-up weird.
          Acne. Backne. Rackne.

          And the raging hormones coursing
          through their bodies aren’t
          helping. Just makes them mean and
          manipulative and cunning-

                    GREG
          So they basically turn into you?

                    RANDALL
          You know what else isn’t helping?
          The internet. All the world’s worst
          things at your fingertips. Every
          time we try to shield Marty from
          the harsh realities of the world,
          here comes lil Greta with another
          devastating sound byte about the
          impending apocalypse. I’m sorry but
          a ten year old should not have to
          deal with that.

                    GREG
          Yeah that sounds really tough. Hey
          Randall, have you got Marty’s poo
          on your hand recently?

          You guys can actually talk to your
          kids and their brains are able to
          process the words. I feel like I’m
          a goddamn Peanuts character to my
          kids. It’s so. Frustrating.

                    JUNE
          But they’re not trying to frustrate
          you. That’s the difference. They
          just need you and want your
          attention. Kids that age are always
          in the moment and you just need to
          be in the moment with them.

                    NICOLE
              (insulted)
          I am in the moment. Every waking
          moment.

                    GREG
          We’re fine! We just need to keep
          our heads down for the next 5 years
          or so until the kids can actually
          do something for themselves, and
          life will be good again.

                    RANDALL
          What? Then you’d be skipping over
          the best part! You don’t know how
          good you have it. Your kids still
          want to be around you.

                    GREG
          How many hours do you sleep at
          night?

           RANDALL                          JUNE
Not that many. 8?              Oh, I need my 9.

                    GREG
          I haven’t had 9 hours of sleep this
          week! Their bedtime routine lasts
          two full hours and doesn’t even put
          them to sleep. And when they
          finally do fall asleep, they piss
          the sheets and then we have to do
          bedtime routine all over again.

                    RANDALL
          Bedtime routine. Ah, I miss that.

          sleepy foreheads.

              (tearing up)
          I’m sorry. I’ve had too much wine.

Randall takes another massive gulp of wine. June looks at
Randall, wishing there was something she could do to help
him. The wheels start turning, then... AN EPIPHANY.

                    JUNE
          Sounds like you guys need a break.
          Why don’t we take them off your
          hands for awhile?

                       NICOLE
          Take what?

                    JUNE
          Your boys. And you take Amy and
          Marty.

Greg, Nicole and Randall look at June. Is she serious?

                    GREG
          Haha, that’s funny. You wouldn’t
          last a week.

                    JUNE
          You don’t think I could last a week
          with my adorable nephews?

                    GREG
          I know you couldn’t.

                    JUNE
          Care to make it interesting?

                    GREG
          Course I do! I always do!

                    RANDALL
              (to June; incredulous)
          What are you doing right now?


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

June is uncorking another bottle of wine.

                    RANDALL
          Are you serious? Or just drunk?

                    JUNE
          Both. I know it sounds crazy but
          you have been... having a bit of a
          rough time lately. Understandably.

                    JUNE (CONT'D)
          Things have just been so heavy with
          the kids and this could be a way to
          inject some lightness and fun back
          into the house.

Off Randall, considering-


EXT. OLSEN HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Greg gives his pitch to Nicole.

                    GREG
          Let’s think about this for a
          second. We obviously both need a
          break. You especially. Their kids
          are on auto-pilot. If we did this,
          we’d actually get some time to
          ourselves. Not just a few minutes
          here and there. Like, meaningful
          time alone.
              (realizing)
          Oh my god. I could actually get
          some work done.

Nicole is starting to get excited. Then, feels guilty.

                    NICOLE
          But the boys. They’d be so sad.

                     GREG
          Right...

                    NICOLE
          I mean, they would be with their
          uncle and aunt who they love and
          we’d be right nearby if they
          actually needed us.

                    GREG
          Right! So we should do this! Right?

                    NICOLE
          I think we should.

Greg and Nicole high-five enthusiastically.

                    GREG
          Okay. We shouldn’t look too excited
          when they come back. Poker face.

Greg and Nicole put on their best poker faces.

EXT. OLSEN HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER

Both couples are back at the table finalizing the details.

                    GREG
          The kid swap will last one week or
          until either side “taps out”.

                    NICOLE
          No baby sitters or outside help of
          any kind. You have to know what it
          feels like to be trapped.

                    RANDALL
          No internet for Marty. Also No HBO.
          No procedurals. Or anything that
          depicts violence. And no news.

                    GREG
          No news? Is it okay for him to
          stare blankly at a wall?

                    JUNE
          And no going out on school nights
          for Amy.

                    NICOLE
          Alright. Is that it?

June and Randall look at each other. Yeah, that’s it.

                    RANDALL
          How about you guys?

Greg and Nicole look at each other, gleeful.

                    NICOLE
          Just... have fun!

Greg and Nicole burst out laughing. Randall and June smile,
also very satisfied with this arrangement.

                    GREG
          So what do we get when we win?

                     JUNE
          Oh, it’s not about what the winner
          gets. It’s about what happens to
          the loser.

                    GREG
          Humiliation bet. Classic. Just like
          when we were kids.

          Remember when you had to shave off
          your eyebrows before prom?

                    GREG
          Yeah I remember. My date refused to
          go with me.
              (suddenly upset)
          This time you’ll be the one
          shaving. Your head! But you have to
          leave one of those little tufts at
          the front like a cartoon baby.

            NICOLE                         RANDALL
I’m not doing that.             I need my hair.

                    JUNE
          How about winner gets to pick the
          loser’s Halloween costumes?

                    GREG
          No black face. No pedophiles.

          Ugh, then what’s the point?
              (thinking)
          Got it! Tramp stamps. His and hers.

          small of my back over this.

          Fine. Henna. Only lasts 3 weeks.
          But the photo shoot will last a
          life time.

Greg, Nicole and Randall look at each other; they can live
with this. They all raise their glasses.

                    GREG
          A toast. To the two of you, for
          embracing the joy of early
          childhood. May it be as constant
          and unrelenting for you as it’s
          been for us.

                    JUNE
          And to you, for taking your first
          dip in the bottomless reservoir
          that is teenage angst.

                     GREG
          The craziest part is that she’s the
          one that suggested it! She doesn’t
          stand a chance. Oh my god... I’m
          actually going to beat her at
          something.

                    NICOLE
          I just feel bad for their kids. No
          wonder they don’t want to spend
          time with their parents, they don’t
          let them do anything.

                    GREG
          Imagine complaining about your kids
          not wanting to spend time with you.
          You know what I call that?
          Vacation.

                    NICOLE

          How are we gonna tell the kids?

                     JUNE
          I think we just do it gently. Let
          them know they’re loved and that
          this isn’t us wanting time away
          from them.

                    RANDALL
          But that’s exactly what it is.

                    JUNE
          I know. I’m saying we shouldn’t

          the boys and you stayed at their
          place for a week...?

                    AMY

Amy exits. Marty follows. June and Randall share a look; that
was insulting, but also easier than expected.

unlatched, car seats are set on the ground with the BOYS
STILL SITTING IN THEM.

          Oh yeah. Car seats. It’s been so
          long I kinda forgot how to-

Randall and June, sweaty, finally get the car seats fastened.

                    NICOLE
          Alright. Welcome to your home. Amy,
          you can sleep in the boys room.

Nicole opens the door revealing the room’s been re-decorated
with ‘nSync posters and other circa 2000 teen girl
adornments. Amy looks kind of shocked.

                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          I wanted to redecorate for you but
          all I could find was stuff from my
          teenage years. Do girls still like
          Justin Timberlake?

                     AMY
          Well, he did cheat on Jessica Biel.
              (beat)
          But she’s an anti-vaxxer so I’m
          kinda glad he did.

          Seriously? Like, I don’t have to?

                    MARTY
          Pretty sure I know how to make a
          sandwich, Uncle Greg.

                    GREG
          Okay... do you know how to make two
          of them?

Marty nods. Is this kid really going to make him lunch?

Randall, June and the boys enter the park, wide-eyed.

                    RANDALL
          Race you to Toon Town!

Randall and June take off. The boys chase them, excitedly.

- They all ride the Toon Town Roller Coaster. It’s hard to
tell who’s more excited, the kids or the adults.

- They take a GROUP PHOTO WITH GOOFY.

                    ANDREW
          Can we have hot dogs for dinner?

                    RANDALL
          YES!

          Can we get toys from the gift shop?

                    JUNE
          YES!

          YES!

- They ride Splash Mountain and then get the souvenir photo.

                    ANDREW
          Can we-

                    RANDALL
          I’m gonna stop you right there. The
          answer’s YES!

Best. Day. Ever.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BOYS ROOM - LATER

Nicole and Amy hang out, looking at PICTURES on Amy’s phone.

                    NICOLE
          Is that you and your teacher?

                    AMY
          No, that’s my friend, Jasmine.

PHOTO of JASMINE, who does not look 13 years old.

                    NICOLE
          Oh. She’s in your class? She
          looks... mature.

                    AMY
          Yeah, she’s super cool. She has the
          best clothes, and like the most
          Insta followers in our school.

                    NICOLE
          That is the barometer for cool
          these days. How about you? You got
          a lot of followers?

                    AMY
          I got a lot more since I became
          friends with Jasmine.

                    NICOLE
          Sounds like your relationship with
          this girl is pretty important.

                    AMY
          It is. Not that my parents care.
          They won’t let me go with her to
          Coachella. I can’t even go to her
          house tomorrow and literally
          everyone’s gonna be there.

                    NICOLE
          Right. It’s a school night.
                                                34.


                    AMY
          Although technically, this week,
          you’re my parent but... whatever.

Nicole senses an opportunity to be a hero.

                    NICOLE
          You know what? You deserve to have
          a life. You’re young. You’re free.
          That doesn’t last forever. Go be
          free!

                    AMY
          Are you serious right now?!

                    NICOLE
          Does the devil wear Prada?

                    AMY
          What?

                    NICOLE
          It means yes. Yes, you can go to
          Jasmine’s tomorrow!

Amy jumps up and hugs Nicole. Nicole beams.

                    AMY
          You’re the coolest aunt ever!


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

Greg and Marty eat sandwiches together. Then:

                    MARTY
          Did my parents send me here because
          they’re sick of me?

                    GREG
          What? No. Why would you say that?

                    MARTY
          Every time I try to talk to them
          about something important they just
          change the subject. Like one time I
          asked about Nazi Germany and my dad
          just put on a bunch of David
          Hasselhoff music videos and danced
          in the kitchen until I walked away.

                    GREG
          Yeah that sounds like Randall.
                                                        35.


                    MARTY
          I wouldn’t say that they’re
          Holocaust deniers but they sure
          aren’t talking about it. At least
          not to me. I guess I should just
          keep all that stuff to myself.

                    GREG
          No! What? You shouldn’t have to
          hide anything from your parents.
          It’s not your fault for asking
          those questions. It’s their fault
          for not answering them. They’re,
          like, not doing their job.

Greg notices Marty looking even sadder. He reels it back.

                    GREG (CONT’D)
          Look, your parents just want to
          protect you. They want you to be a
          kid and to not have to worry. But,
          I’m your uncle and if you wanna
          worry about depressing stuff around
          me then knock yourself out.

                    MARTY
          Really? Okay. Uh, the whole Israel-
          Palestine thing. How did it start?
          Who’s fault is it?

                    GREG
          That’s a whole chicken and egg
          situation. Full disclosure, I’m not
          exactly a Middle East expert, but
          I’d say the real reason for all the
          bloodshed? It’s the heat. You can’t
          solve anything in those conditions.

                    MARTY
          I have noticed there’s always
          people fighting over parking spaces
          at the beach.

                    GREG
          There you go! It’s the heat. What
          else you got? Hit me. This is fun.

                    MARTY
          Is it true it’s not okay to listen
          to Michael Jackson anymore?
                                                        36.


                    GREG
          Hmm. Depends who you ask. If you
          wanna be safe just stick to Jackson
          5. Before he reached the age where
          he was able to... you know...

                    MARTY
          What?

                    GREG
          Before he could... allegedly... you
          know...

                    MARTY
          I don’t. Tell me!

                     GREG
          Okay, maybe we should finish eating
          first. While we still have our
          appetites.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER

Greg and Nicole meet up. The house is quiet for once.

                     NICOLE
          Amy’s settling in. She’s just on
          her phone.

                    GREG
          Yeah, Marty’s just hanging out in
          his room, doing his own thing.

They stare at each other, unsure what to do with themselves.

                    NICOLE
          What do we do now?

                    GREG
          Anything we want?

                    NICOLE
          Let’s clean the house!


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - LATER

Greg and Nicole pop a bottle of champagne. They drink and
clean the house while dancing to music.
                                                         37.


EXT. DISNEYLAND - MAIN STREET - EVENING

The boys are on June and Randall’s shoulders, mesmerized by
the FIREWORKS display. Randall and June hold hands and smile
at each other. They’re reconnecting.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - LATER

The house is spotless. Greg and Nicole admire their work.

                    GREG
          I put up the new towel rack in the
          bathroom. I’ve been meaning to do
          that for three years.

                    NICOLE
          I finished the laundry. Like,
          finished it. There’s nothing in the
          washer or dryer. It’s done.
          Everything’s clean.

                    GREG
          This is insane. They’re still in
          their rooms.

                    NICOLE
          I know. Should we check on them?
              (calling out)
          You guys need anything?! You okay?

         MARTY (O.S.)                       AMY (O.S.)
Nope! Good night!               All good!

Greg and Nicole stare at each other in disbelief.

                    GREG / NICOLE
          K! Good night!


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Greg and Nicole, in bed, finish the last of the champagne.

                    NICOLE
          I feel like this is the first time
          we’ve been in bed together this
          early in so long.

                    GREG
          These sheets feel so clean.

They lay there for a beat.
                                                           38.


                    GREG (CONT’D)
          So... this kinda feels like the
          perfect opportunity to have sex.

                    NICOLE
          Yeah. It really does.

                    GREG
          Do you... want to?

                    NICOLE
          I don’t know... do you?

                    GREG
          ... not really.

                    NICOLE
          Me neither. I kinda just wanna go
          to sleep.

                    GREG
          Me too! God I love you so much.

They kiss each other, both roll over and turn off the lights.


I/E. OLSENS HOUSE - NIGHT

Randall and June carry the sleeping boys from the car to
their beds, tucking them in.


INT. OLSENS HOUSE - BEDROOM - SOON AFTER

June and Randall get ready for bed.

                    RANDALL
          I can’t even remember the last time
          we had a family day. You were
          right. This was a great idea.

                    JUNE
          It really was. I had a great time.

Randall scrolls through the PICTURES he took at Disneyland.

                    RANDALL
          Look how happy they look. Not a
          care in the world. I don’t know
          what Greg and Nicole are
          complaining about. You’d think
          after being parents for five years
          they’d be better at this by now.
                                                           39.


                     JUNE
          Well, Greg was the baby who never
          had to learn how to do anything on
          his own, so not totally surprising.
              (then)
          We should send them all of these
          pictures. Rub it in their faces how
          well we’re doing.

                    RANDALL
          Yup! I’ll go take pictures of the
          boys sleeping soundly!


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

June and Randall are woken up by a tug on their blanket.

                    ANDREW
          We’re hungry.

                    RANDALL
          Wow. The first thing they wanna do
          in the morning is be with us.

                    JUNE
          Such a gift.

                    RANDALL
          So how do you wanna coordinate work
          schedules? Should we trade off or-

                    JUNE
          I was actually thinking of taking
          the day off...

                    RANDALL
          I could call in a sick day...

They smile at each other, excited to play hookie together.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          Who wants pancakes?!


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MORNING

Randall and June, still in pajamas, make pancakes with the
boys, who stand on step stools to reach over the counter.

                    JUNE
          So we need to add flour, milk and
          one egg to the bowl and then we
          mix, mix, mix it all together.
                                                        40.


                    AARON
          I get to crack the egg!

                    ANDREW
          No, I wanna crack it!

As June hands the egg to Aaron, Andrew reaches over and the
egg falls onto the floor, breaking. Aaron starts pouting.

                    AARON
          Andrew broke my egg.

                    ANDREW
          No, you dropped it. Cuz you’re a
          stupid baby with stupid baby hands.

Aaron PUSHES Andrew. Andrew SMACKS Aaron back. Before things
can escalate, Randall pulls out more eggs from the fridge.

                    RANDALL
          Whoa, whoa, whoa. You guys, look!
          We have sooooo many more eggs!
          Watch. I’m a real egghead!

Randall takes out an egg, places it on his head, and lets it
fall to the ground. The boys laugh. Then, June hands each of
the boys their own bowl and egg.

                    AARON
          Look at me! I’m a real egghead!

Aaron puts the egg on his head and it smashes on the floor.

                    ANDREW
          Look at me! I’m a real egghead!

                    RANDALL
          Wait! That’s our-

Andrew’s egg falls to the floor.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          - last egg. So much for pancakes.

                    JUNE
              (off the boys’ GROANS)
          That’s okay! We have cereal!

                    ANDREW
          Ugh. Cereal’s so boring.

                    RANDALL
          Not if you eat your cereal like...
          a HIPPOPOTAMUS!!!
                                                           41.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Randall, June, Andrew and Aaron crawl on their hands and
knees pretending to be hippos, eating cereal off the floor.

                    AARON
          More river plants!

June pours more dry cereal on the floor.

                    ANDREW
          What a beautiful day to chomp down
          river plants in our favorite river.

June and Randall give each other approving nods and then
crawl up to each other for a hushed conversation.

                    JUNE
          See? All you have to do is turn a
          potentially bad situation into a
          fun game and recapture their
          imagination. It’s simple.

The boys are now WRESTLING over the cereal on the floor.

                    RANDALL
          Easy, easy. Plenty of river plants
          to go around.
              (to June)
          Uh oh. I think we inadvertently
          created a human game of Hungry,
          Hungry Hippos.

The boys start KICKING and PUNCHING each other.

                    JUNE
          Let’s be happy hippos! Oh look, a
          tourist boat! They want to take
          pictures of the happy hippos! Smile
          for the tourists!

It’s not working. The boys won’t separate.

                    RANDALL
          Jeez. He kicked him right in the
          small of the back. All over a
          Cheerio. How do we get them to stop
          fighting?

                    JUNE
          ...maybe we don’t.

June and Randall share a knowing look.
                                                         42.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - MORNING

Greg and Nicole wake up. The clock reads 8:40am.

                    NICOLE
          Did the clocks move forward last
          night?

                    GREG
          No. I think we... slept in. My body
          feels like, different.

                    NICOLE
          Yes. I feel like, what’s the word
          I’m looking for? Rested.

Greg checks his phone and sees 10 NEW TEXTS from June.

                    GREG
          Oh, you bitch.

                       NICOLE
          Excuse me?

                    GREG
          Not you. June. I’m allowed to call
          her that cuz she’s my sister.

                       NICOLE
          Are you?

                    GREG
          I’m not totally sure, but look at
          what she sent.

We see ALL THE HAPPY PHOTOS June and Randall took at
Disneyland, capped off with a photo of the boys sleeping with
the caption: Bedtime Routine. 2 Seconds #goodparenting

                    NICOLE
          Oh, that bitch! Let’s go take
          pictures of their happy kids and
          rub it in their faces.

                    GREG
          Yes! You see what great ideas we
          come up with when we sleep?


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - OFFICE - LATER

Greg and Nicole go to Marty’s room but he’s not in there.
                                                           43.


                    GREG
          Must be in the bathroom.

                    NICOLE
          Well we’re not gonna take a picture
          of him in there.

As they’re about to leave, they hear the FAINT SOUNDS OF
MOANING. It’s coming from the computer.

                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          Ohhhhh no. That’s not...

They warily approach the computer. Greg clicks the mouse with
a shaky finger. Sure enough, it’s PORNOGRAPHY.

                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          Ew!

                    GREG
          Let’s not overreact. Could just be
          a pop-up.

                    NICOLE
          Check the search history.

                    GREG
          You check it.

                    NICOLE
          I’m not touching that mouse!

Greg checks the SEARCH HISTORY. It’s a long graphic list.

                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          God, did he even sleep last night?!

                    GREG
          Jesus. We weren’t even supposed to
          give him internet and now he’s
          discovered the entire world of
          porn? He left no stone unturned! He
          saw all of it! What do we do?!

                    NICOLE
          If we were June and Randall, we’d
          sweep this whole incident under the
          rug, pretend it didn’t happen, and
          cancel the internet until he was
          21. But that’s not us.

                    GREG
          Right... we’re not his parents.
          This doesn’t have to be weird.
                    (MORE)
                                                        44.

                    GREG (CONT'D)
          We should just play it cool and
          talk to him about it.

                    NICOLE
          Exactly. We’re the cool ones.

                    GREG
          We just have to make sure he
          doesn’t feel ashamed. That kind of
          thing can leave a lasting
          impression. His eyes cannot hit the
          ground.

                    MARTY (O.S.)
          Hey.

Greg and Nicole are startled. Marty sees them at the computer
and his face turns beet red, starts looking down.

                    GREG
          No-no-no! Don’t look down!


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - OFFICE - LATER

Greg and Nicole are seated across from Marty.

                    NICOLE
          There’s nothing to be ashamed of
          here. Your body’s changing and we
          know it can be a confusing time.

                    GREG
          I’m a guy. I’ve been there. When
          you’re a kid, all you’re using that
          thing for is peeing. Maybe the
          occasional sword fight. Then you
          reach an age where you realize it
          can do other... tricks.

                    MARTY
          I was just watching.

                     NICOLE
          Sure. Sure you were... do you have
          any questions about what you
          “watched”?

                    MARTY
          Not really.
                                                        45.


                    NICOLE
          Okay... well the thing to keep in
          mind is that watching too much of
          that stuff can warp your perception
          of what sex is like in real life.

                    GREG
          Yeah, in real life, women aren’t
          usually that “enthusiastic”.

Nicole shoots Greg a look.

                    NICOLE
          And the average man is a lot
          more... let’s say “average” sized.

                    GREG
          Yeah, and in real life, you’ll find
          that women aren’t willing to do the
          vast majority of “acts” you saw.

                     MARTY
          Okay, are you almost done? I think
          I can sort of figure out the rest
          on my own.

Marty sits back at the desk. Greg disconnects the computer
and picks it up. It’s heavier than he thought it would be.

                     GREG
          Yeah... probably time you take a
          little breather from the videos.
              (then)
          But not because you should feel
          ashamed about it.
              (then)
          Though you should probably keep
          this a secret from your parents.
          They don’t have to know about this.

                    MARTY
          But yesterday you told me I
          shouldn’t have to hide anything
          from my parents.

                    GREG
          That’s true. But this is different.

                    MARTY
          Why?
              (off Greg’s silence)
          Unless there’s a reason you want me
          to hide this from them...
                    (MORE)
                                                        46.

                    MARTY (CONT'D)
          which I would entertain... if you
          put the computer back...

Greg looks down at the computer in his hands.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Greg finishes reconnecting the computer. He nods to Marty as
he and Nicole leave the room.

                    NICOLE
              (sotto; to Greg)
          Well, that was a disgusting way to
          start our morning.


EXT. OLSEN HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER

Andrew and Aaron are dressed in bathrobes with PILLOW
CUSHIONS TAPED TO THEIR HEADS AND HANDS. They both sit on
tiny stools in the corners of a MAKESHIFT BOXING RING.
Randall enters the ring and calls them to the middle.

                    RANDALL
          Alright gentlemen. I want a clean
          fight. That means no biting, no
          rabbit punches, and no hitting
          below the belt.

                    ANDREW
          We’re not wearing any belts.

                    RANDALL
          Perfect. Now touch gloves and wait
          for the sound of the bell.

The boys nod excitedly as Randall climbs out the ring. June
holds up the MINI GONG and a MINI MALLET.

                    JUNE
          Ready? Get set?
              (banging the gong)
          FIGHT!

Andrew and Aaron unload punches on each other but feel
nothing. It’s light and playful, cushions hitting cushions.

                    JUNE (CONT’D)
          That’s it Aaron! When he goes low,
          you go high!
                                                        47.


                    RANDALL
          I don’t think that advice was meant
          to apply to boxing matches but it
          totally works.

                    JUNE
          Greg and Nicole would never do
          something like this in a million
          years. That’s how I know it’s
          smart.

                    RANDALL
          These boys are like a pressure
          cooker. You gotta give them an
          opportunity to release.

                    JUNE
          Exactly. And we’re doing it
          responsibly in a safe environment.

                    RANDALL
          Speaking of which, I only found one
          old mouth guard. You think that’s a
          problem?

                    JUNE
          No. They can’t really hurt each
          other when they’re this young.

Andrew lands a big punch, knocking Aaron to the corner.
Andrew raises his hands in victory. June and Randall rush
over to Aaron for coaching.

                    RANDALL
          Come on, Aaron! Don’t let him clown
          you like that!

                    JUNE
          I want you to think of every mean
          thing your brother’s ever done to
          you. I want you to bottle it. Drink
          it. Then punch him as hard as you
          can in the chest with it.

Aaron gets up, emboldened, charges at Andrew and throws all
his weight into a punch. Surprised, Andrew flies back.

                    JUNE/RANDALL
          AA-RON! AA-RON! AA-RON!

Andrew gets up, angry. As he winds up for ONE MASSIVE PUNCH,
the tape around his wrists comes loose, the cushion flies
off, and he LANDS A CRUSHING BLOW TO AARON’S NOSE WITH HIS
BARE FIST! Aaron screams, covering his face.
                                                        48.


                    JUNE/RANDALL (CONT’D)
          OHHHHH!

June and Randall rush into the ring. They pull Aaron’s hands
away and see his NOSE IS BLEEDING AND HIS EYE IS RED.

                    RANDALL
          I’ll get ice!

Randall rushes off. June applies a towel to Aaron’s nose as
he cries hysterically.

                    ANDREW
          Haha, I win. You lose.

                    JUNE
          Andrew, go to your corner!
              (to Aaron)
          Shhh. Let’s just try to calm down.
          How about we sing a song?
              (singing)
          Raindrops on roses and whiskers on
          kittens. Bright copper kettles and
          warm woolen mittens.

This actually starts working. Aaron begins to settle down,
catching his breath. June smiles at him and continues.

                    JUNE (CONT’D)
          Brown paper baskets all tied up
          with strings, these are a few of my
          favorite things. When the dog
          bites. When the bee stings. When
          I’m feeling sad...

Upon hearing those lyrics, Aaron’s eyes well up with tears.

                    JUNE (CONT’D)
          Oh no. I’m sorry. Did that part
          make you sad?

                    AARON
              (bursts out crying)
          Yeaaaaaaaaaaaah.

                      JUNE
          Wait, there’s more!
               (singing cheerfully)
          I simply remember my favorite
          things and then I don’t feel so
          bad.
               (then)
          See? The whole point of the song is
          to not feel bad!
                      (MORE)
                                                        49.

                    JUNE (CONT'D)
          Think about your favorite things,
          huh? Can you name one of your
          favorite things?

                    AARON
              (crying even harder)
          My maaaaa-maaaaa.

Randall returns and tries to apply the ice to Aaron’s eye.
Aaron knocks his hand away, in hysterics.

                    ANDREW
          He doesn’t want ice. He wants mom.

                    JUNE
          Aaron, sweetie, I’m also a mom.

                    ANDREW
          He doesn’t want a mom. He wants mom
          mom.

Aaron continues to wail. June and Randall look at each other,
unsure what to do.

                    NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
          Is everything okay? Someone sounds
          really hurt over there.

                    JUNE
          Everything’s fine, Mr. Abrahmson!
              (under her breath)
          Go back to your morning gin and
          tonic.

                    RANDALL
          Should we call Nicole?

                    JUNE
          And show weakness? No chance. It’s
          only Day Two. I would never give
          Greg the satisfaction.

                    RANDALL
          Satisfaction? This isn’t a duel.

                    JUNE
          Don’t be so naive, Randall. That’s
          exactly what this is.

                     RANDALL
          Alright, well we need to do
          something.
                                                          50.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

The boys are on the couch, glued to the TV. Randall and June
watch them from kitchen.

                    JUNE
          You think Greg and Nicole will
          notice?

REVEAL Aaron has TWO SWOLLEN EYES and balled-up Kleenex
stuffed in his nostrils.

                    RANDALL
          I’m gonna say... definitely.

                    JUNE
          Come on. A little make-up, a little
          concealer. I feel like we can hide
          this from them.

                     RANDALL
          Maaaaaybe.
              (then)
          At least the TV made him stop
          screaming. Neither of them have
          moved a muscle in ten minutes.

                    JUNE
          As long as he’s not crying for his
          mom I say we roll with it.

                    RANDALL
          We can turn it into a movie night.
          Order some pizza?

                     JUNE
          Love it.

June and Randall happily join the kids on the couch.


INT. REAL ESTATE PROPERTY - DAY

Greg struggles to stage an open house. He’s well-rested and
yet, still looks miserable doing this. Then Nicole enters
holding a BOUQUET OF FLOWERS. Greg is pleasantly surprised.

                    GREG
          Hey! What are you doing here?

                    NICOLE
          The kids are at school. Like, all
          day. Thought I’d swing by and drop
          these off for your open.
                                                        51.


                    GREG
          Wow. Thanks!

Nicole puts the bouquet down and then takes a look at the way
the living room is staged. Hmmmm.

                    GREG (CONT’D)
          What?

                     NICOLE
          Oh nothing.
              (then)
          It’s just, if you moved those two
          chairs over here, you can turn this
          area into a nice reading space.
          Plus it would open up the whole
          living room.
              (stopping herself)
          But I don’t wanna-

                    GREG
          No. It’s totally fine. Go ahead.

Greg and Nicole are both walking on eggshells, careful not to
offend each other. They move the chairs to the new spot.

                    GREG (CONT’D)
          Yeah, definitely feels more open.

                    NICOLE
          K, I should get out of your hair.

                    GREG
          You sure? You don’t have to.

                    NICOLE
          No, I’ll let you do your thing.

                    GREG
          Okay. What are you going to do? You
          have the whole day to yourself.
          Finally.

                    NICOLE
          I know! Exciting!


INT. GROCERY STORE - LATER

Nicole walks down an empty aisle, shopping alone. Not
remotely exciting.
                                                           52.


INT. YOUNG HOME - KITCHEN - LATER

Nicole anxiously sits at the table, no idea what to do with
herself. Then Marty walks in the door, home from school. She
immediately perks up and pounces on him.

                    NICOLE
          Hey Marty! How was school?

                    MARTY
          Fine.

                    NICOLE
          Can I help with your homework? Make
          you something to eat?

                    MARTY
          No, I’m good. Got everything I need
          right in here.

Marty walks into the office and closes the door. Gross.

Nicole returns to the table. She’s restless, antsy. So she
decides to text AMY:

Nicole - Is 8:00 still cool for a pick-up?

AMY - 9:00 would be cooler. I can also get a ride home from
Debbie’s mom. Is that okay?

Nicole’s a bit disappointed, then types in “No problem” -
then changes it to “NP” - then finally settles on “Obvs” and
presses send. She stares at her phone, waiting for a response
that never comes.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

June, Randall and the kids are still on the couch, empty
pizza boxes on the table, when the movie ends.

                    RANDALL
          Alright! Now we know how a talking
          pig gets by in the city. Pretty
          well!

As soon as Randall turns off the TV, the boys snap out of
their zombie-like state and start WRITHING AROUND ON THE
COUCH, like they’re crawling out of their skin.

                    ANDREW / AARON
          BAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!
                                                           53.


                    JUNE
          Jesus. What is happening? It’s
          like they’re going through detox.

                    RANDALL
          It looks like they’re in real pain.

            AARON                           ANDREW
ONE MORE SHOW!!                 PUT IT BACK ON!

                    RANDALL
          This is too much. I can’t take it.

Randall turns the TV back on, and the boys return to their
zombie-like state.

                    JUNE
          Okay, one more show and then
          bedtime. Deal?

                    ANDREW / AARON
          Deal.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

The show ends and June turns off the TV.

                    JUNE
          Alright, show’s over. Bedtime.

The boys’ writhing/flailing is even worse now.

                    RANDALL
          I don’t think that extra show
          helped. We just gave addicts more
          of the drug.

                    JUNE
          Time for them to go cold turkey.
          Bedtime intervention!

June and Randall pick up the boys and carry them to their
room. The boys groan and move spastically trying to get away.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

As June tucks the boys in bed, Randall enters carrying a
CHEST OF AMY & MARTY’S CHILDHOOD MEMORABILIA.

                    RANDALL
          Who’s ready for story-time?
                                                        54.


                    ANDREW/AARON
          ME!

                    JUNE
          Oh my god. Look at all this stuff.
          It’s been so long.

June and Randall flip through the items in the chest,
nostalgic. She pulls out a book.

                    JUNE (CONT’D)
          Corduroy. Marty’s favorite.

                    AARON
          I don’t like bears.

                    JUNE
          Okay. How about The Gruffalo? He’s
          not quite a bear. And not quite
          a... I’m not really sure what he
          is. Should we find out?

                    AARON
          Yeah!

June and Randall start reading with great enthusiasm. The
boys snuggle in. June and Randall are loving this.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Greg and Marty sit on the couch watching Planet Earth -
specifically the part with the starving, yellow polar bear.

                     GREG
          When I was a kid, polar bears were
          white. Look at this guy - was he
          rolling around in honey or
          something?

                    MARTY
          She’s starving, Uncle Greg.

                    SIR DAVID (V.O.)
          She’s tired, emaciated, and must
          find food quickly. Her fat reserves
          hardly protect her from the cold.

                     GREG
          Oof. You’d think the film crew
          might toss her some trail mix or
          something.

Nicole paces, looking out the window and checking the time.
                                                        55.


                    GREG (CONT’D)
          Can you please relax? You’re the
          one that convinced me letting her
          go out on school night was okay
          because she’d never tell June and
          Randall. What’s the big deal?

                    NICOLE
          Ummm, that it’s past 9 and she’s
          not texting me back.

                    GREG
          Oh, seriously? That’s not good.

                    NICOLE
          Now you sound worried. Maybe you
          should go pick her up. I’ll stay
          here with Marty.

                    GREG
          Why do I have to go?

                    NICOLE
          I sort of positioned myself as the
          cool aunt and that might hurt my
          image...
              (off Greg’s stare)
          Ok fine we’ll both go. Marty, we’ll
          be right back. You gonna be okay on
          your own?

On the TV, there’s a shot of ICE CAPS falling into the ocean.
Marty’s eyes well up with tears, and through his glassy eyes
we see the reflection of the fallen ice caps. But Greg and
Nicole are practically out the door, too distracted to notice
their distraught nephew.

                    GREG
          Ehhh, you’ll be fine.


INT. OLSENS HOUSE - BEDROOM - MUCH LATER

There’s now a PILE OF BOOKS on the floor. June and Randall
look tired but they’re braving through it.

                    JUNE
          Okay! That’s ALL of the books.
          Literally every one.

June and Randall both get up and kiss the boys good night.

                    RANDALL
          See you boys in the morning.
                                                     56.


                    ANDREW
          We’re not tired. We want an
          Avengers book.

                    RANDALL
          We don’t have any of those. They
          weren’t quite as popular when Amy
          and Marty were your age.

                    ANDREW
          Then make it up.

Randall sighs, not wanting to disappoint the kids.

                    RANDALL
          Ummmm... okay. Once upon a time
          in... Avenger’s land-

                    AARON
          Asgard!

                    RANDALL
          Right. Asgard. Thor was using his
          hammer to... build a... new house
          out of... space bricks.

                    ANDREW
          Okay...

                    RANDALL
          That’s when his brother...

                    AARON
          Loki!

                    RANDALL
          Loki. Stole Thor’s hammer because
          he wanted to make his own house-

                    AARON
          Loki can’t lift Mjolnir!

June heads for the door. Randall notices.

                    RANDALL
          Hey, you’re leaving?

                    JUNE
          I was just gonna go do the dishes.

                    RANDALL
          There aren’t any. We ordered pizza.
                                                          57.


                    JUNE
          I’ll flatten the boxes. You’re
          doing great. Keep going.

Before Randall can say anything else, she’s out the door.

            ANDREW                            AARON             *
Loki’s a shape shifter!           Make him transform!

Randall looks to the door, yearning to walk through it.


EXT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - LATER

Greg and Nicole pull up to the house and approach the front
door. Nicole LIGHTLY knocks on it.

                    GREG
          You barely touched it. They’re not
          gonna hear that.

Greg knocks louder. A 16 YEAR OLD BOY (XANDER) answers.

                    XANDER
          Yeah?

                    GREG
          Uh, hi. Are your parents home?

                    XANDER
          Nope.

                    NICOLE
          Huh, she didn’t mention that.
              (to Xander)
          Okay. We’re here to pick up Amy.
          Can you quietly let her know her
          uncle is waiting for her outside?

A GIRL flirtatiously pulls Xander away by the arm.

                    XANDER
          You can just tell her yourself.
          She’s in the basement.

Greg and Nicole stand in the open doorway, unsure. The sound
of BUMP N’ GRIND R&B MUSIC emanates from the basement.

                    NICOLE
          R&B? In the basement?
                                                           58.


                    GREG
          Don’t jump to conclusions. Maybe
          they’re watching Surviving R Kelly
          and that’s why we’re hearing those
          sexy slow jams.

They step inside, slowly moving towards the basement stairs.


INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - BASEMENT STAIRWAY - MOMENTS LATER

They inch down the stairs, hearts pounding. They hide behind
the wall, careful not to be seen.

                      NICOLE
          Look.

                      GREG
          You look.

Nicole puts her phone on CAMERA MODE and holds it out to get
a view of the basement: a mix of 13 year old girls and 16
year old boys. Some dancing, some flirting on the couch.

                    NICOLE
          She told me it would just be girls
          over. Not boys with full beards.

                    GREG
          I’m not liking the age discrepancy
          here. And the R Kelly music
          definitely isn’t helping.

                    NICOLE
          I can’t see Amy.

Nicole extends her arm further to get a better view.

                    JASMINE (O.S.)
          Uhhh, whose arm is that?

Greg and Nicole gasp. She quickly pulls her arm back. Jasmine
rushes over.

                    JASMINE (CONT’D)
          Who are you? What are you doing in
          my house?

Greg and Nicole are busted. They step out from behind the
wall and try to play it cool. The party stops. All eyes are
on them, including AMY, who is mortified.
                                                        59.


                    NICOLE
          Hey girrrrl. We’re uh-
              (to Greg)
          - hey, what are we doing here?

                    GREG
          I’ll tell you what we’re not here
          to do. And that’s, kill the vibe.

                    NICOLE
          Yeah, don’t mind us. Please
          continue... vibing.

                    JASMINE
          Were you just filming us?

                    NICOLE
              (re: phone)
          Oh, this? No, I just had it out and
          I always keep it on camera mode for
          my Insta, but I’m not recording.
              (noticing)
          Oh shit, I am. But I’ll delete it.

Amy rushes over and pushes Greg and Nicole up the stairs.

                    AMY
              (quietly)
          Can you get out of here?! Please!

                    GREG
              (quietly)
          Yes! We desperately want to. But,
          with you.

                    JASMINE
          Amy, they’re right. It’s a school
          night and it’s probably past your
          bedtime anyway.

Some SNICKERING from other kids at the party. Mortified, Amy
pushes Greg and Nicole up the stairs.


INT. MINIVAN - SOON AFTER

Amy SLAMS the van door behind her.

                    AMY
          I can’t BELIEVE you just did that.
                                                        60.


                     NICOLE
          I’m sorry, honey. It was your
          uncle’s idea. I tried to talk him
          out of it.

                    GREG
          Wow. Just... wow.

                    NICOLE
          In fairness to your uncle, you did
          mention you’d be home by 9 and you
          weren’t responding to texts so,
          that’s probably why he got so bent
          out of shape about it.

                    GREG
          Ah, doubling down on it. Okay.

                    AMY
          That was the most embarrassing
          thing that has EVER HAPPENED TO
          ANYONE!

                    GREG
          Oh yeah? I once got tackled at the
          homecoming game and my football
          pants got ripped off in front of
          the whole school. It was infinitely
          more embarrassing. The Mayor was
          there.

                    NICOLE
          I’m sure it’s not as bad as you’re
          building it up to be in your head-

Then, Amy’s phone starts DINGING. She looks at it.

                    AMY
          AHHHHHHH!!!

Greg swerves, nearly colliding with a fire hydrant.

                    GREG
          Jesus! What happened?!

                    AMY
          You ruined my life!

Amy shows them an INSTAGRAM PHOTO on Jasmine’s account --
it’s a GROUP PHOTO of all the girls and boys at the party.
Jasmine is holding up a BABY DOLL.
                                                        61.


                    AMY (CONT’D)
          She tagged the baby doll with MY
          NAME! She’s saying I’m a little
          kid!

                    NICOLE
          Amy, it’s just one picture-

Ding. Ding. Ding.

                    AMY
          With like a hundred comments!
          Everyone’s laughing at me!

                    GREG
          Just cuz they’re typing “LOL”
          doesn’t mean they’re really
          laughing out-

                    AMY
          I’m not talking to you!

                    NICOLE
          It’s okay, honey. You don’t have to
          talk to your uncle.

                    AMY
          I’m not talking to you either.

Nicole GASPS. Amy scowls out the window.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - KID’S BEDROOM - LATER

It’s now 11:45pm. Randall is lying on the floor, half-asleep.

                    RANDALL
          ... that’s when Chris Evans tripped
          on the tesseract... and that shot
          him back to the year...
          nineteen...thirty... four...

Randall chokes on his own SNORE, jolting himself awake. He
checks the boys -- they’re finally asleep. He tiptoes out of
the room and into-


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

- where June is already in bed. Randall joins her.
                                                        62.


                     RANDALL
          That took a little longer than last
          night. What happened? You never
          came back.

                    JUNE
          Oh. I figured you had it under
          control. I mean, we don’t have to
          do everything together, right?

                    RANDALL
              (hiding his hurt)
          Right. Okay good night.

                    JUNE
          Good night. Love you.

They turn off their bedside lamps and go to bed.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Nicole and Greg lie in bed, wide awake.

                    GREG
          You really threw   me under the bus
          back there. Then   you threw the bus
          driver out, took   the wheel, and
          backed over me a   couple more times.

                    NICOLE
          What difference does it make? She
          blamed me too.

                    GREG
          Yeah, I guess it makes no
          difference at all. Well... at least
          Marty’s doing okay. We’re 1 for 2.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - OFFICE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Marty is still awake, completely fixated on the computer
screen. We assume he’s on another depraved deep dive into
porn. But as the camera turns around, the screen shows he’s
actually on a CLIMATE CHANGE DEEP DIVE. Depressing
STATISTICS, SOUNDBITES and CLIPS OF ENVIRONMENTAL WUNDERKIND
GRETA THUNBERG fly at him off the screen. So much
information. All of it bad.
                                                          63.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

2:04am. Randall and June are fast asleep. Suddenly, they’re
jolted awake, horror-movie style, by Aaron who is standing in
their bedroom, completely drenched in pee and pouting.

                    AARON
          I’m wet. I’m wet. I’m weeeeeet.

                    JUNE
          It’s okay, sweetie. Everyone has
          accidents. Ever since I had the
          kids, I pee a bit every time I
          sneeze.

                    RANDALL
          Really? You sneeze a lot.

                    JUNE
          Okay, should we change the sheets?

                    RANDALL
          I mean, we don’t have to do
          everything together, right?

Point taken. June leads Aaron out of the bedroom.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - KID’S BEDROOM - LATER

June changes the sheets and tucks Aaron into bed.

                    AARON
          Can you tell me another story?

                    JUNE
          Oh honey it’s late.

Aaron starts LOUDLY WHINING. Worried he might wake up his
brother, June relents and starts reading another book.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

It’s 6am when the boys once again wake June and Randall up.
This time, it’s a lot less cute.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - A BIT LATER

June and Randall serve the boys breakfast. They’re exhausted
and barely talking to each other.
                                                        64.


                    RANDALL
          Alright I should probably get ready
          for work.

                    JUNE
          Oh, you were gonna go- cuz I was
          planning on going to the studio
          today.

                    RANDALL
          Okay, how do we decide who goes...

They look over at the boys who are now hitting each others’
knuckles with spoons.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          And who stays?

                    JUNE
          I’ll go. You stay.

                    RANDALL
          Oh, so by whoever calls it out
          first?

                    JUNE
          And tomorrow I’ll stay home and
          we’ll just switch off.

                    RANDALL
          Okay. I’ll stay home with them.

Randall looks at the boys who are flinging oatmeal at each
other’s open mouths, missing and making a huge mess.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          Actually think I’ll take them out.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Nicole is making omelettes while Greg gets ready for work.
They hear AMY making her way downstairs.

                    NICOLE
          Hey Amy! Making you an eggwhite
          omelette! I know how you feel about
          those yolks-

Amy enters wearing HOMEMADE JEAN SHORTS and FAR TOO MUCH MAKE-
UP. She makes a smoothie while Greg and Nicole huddle.
                                                  65.


                    GREG
          Uhh, what is happening right now?
          Why’s she dressed like that?

                    NICOLE
          Why do you think? Jasmine shamed
          her for being a little kid and now
          she’s massively overcorrecting.

                    GREG
          We can’t let her go to school like
          that. Can we?

                    NICOLE
          No. Let’s just make her feel
          supported. Get back on her good
          side.
              (overly cheerful)
          Amy! You really gave yourself a
          makeover, huh?

                    GREG
          Yeah. Really digging the smoky eye.
          It’s a real chimney sweep look.

No response. Greg presses Nicole to keep going.

                    NICOLE
          But are you sure that it’s “school
          appropriate”?

                    AMY
          What’s that supposed to mean?

Amy stares at them, seeing through their act.

                    NICOLE
          Honey, we know you got some flack
          in that picture, but... this isn’t
          you.

                    AMY
          Yes it is. I decide what’s me.

                     GREG
          I think what Aunt Nicole is trying
          to say is-

                    AMY
          ARE YOU TRYING TO CONTROL MY BODY,
          UNCLE GREG?
                                                        66.


                    GREG
          Uhh, I- No! Never! I can’t even
          control my body! Look how many
          times I cut myself shaving this
          morning!

Amy walks out the room. That did not go well.

                    GREG (CONT’D)
          Okay, we’re still 1 for 2.

Then Marty walks in, still in his pajamas. In the background
we can see Amy stealing money out of Greg’s wallet.

                    GREG (CONT’D)
          What’s with you? Why aren’t you
          dressed for school?

                    MARTY
          I’m not going to school.

                     GREG
          Why not?

                    MARTY
          What’s the point? The polar ice
          caps are melting. The world as we
          know it is going to wash away.

                    GREG
          Well as long as schools are still
          above sea level, you have to go.

                     MARTY
          Greta Thunberg doesn’t have to go
          to school.

                    GREG
          That’s because she’s traveling the
          globe raising awareness and shaming
          political leaders.

                    MARTY
          I want to do that too. I want to
          join her. Be by her side.

                    NICOLE
              (faux martyr)
          You know what? If he doesn’t want
          to go to school today, then I guess
          he can stay home with me.

Surprised, Greg leaves the room, shaking his head.
                                                        67.


                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          Marty? Eggwhite omelette?

                    MARTY
          You mean the chicken abortion? You
          can eat it.

Nicole nods, then slides the omelette in the trash.


INT. PANCAKE PALACE - LATER

As Randall and the boys enter, he proudly presents the place.

                    RANDALL
          Welcome to the Pancake Palace! Used
          to take Amy and Marty here all the
          time.

                    ANDREW
          Why’d you stop?

                    RANDALL
          You’d have to ask them. I’m not the
          one who stopped wanting to.
              (sad beat; then)
          Let’s order French Toast Dippers,
          huh?! Get the mood back up!

The boys grab for the same menu and jostle over it, knocking
cutlery to the floor. Randall smiles through it.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          Hey boys, no need to fight over
          everything. Here, take mine.

Randall hands Aaron his menu. His eye is extremely swollen.

                    AARON
          I can’t read the menu cuz of my
          eye.

                    ANDREW
          You can’t read at all. Because of
          your brain.

                       AARON
          Yes I can!

                    RANDALL
          If you stop fighting I’ll give you
          double ice cream!

The boys get excited and stop fighting.
                                                           68.


                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          Why’d I start with double ice
          cream?

The boys look around at the OTHER RESTAURANT-GOERS.

                    ANDREW
          HEY! THAT WOMAN LOOKS LIKE THANOS!

They start SNAPPING their fingers at the WOMAN.

                    RANDALL
          Shhhh! No she doesn’t!
              (looks over at woman)
          Okay, she does. But that’s probably
          a medical condition that makes her
          look kinda purple. Either way, if
          you’re gonna say someone looks like
          Thanos, at least whisper it.

Bored and impatient, the boys lie down at the booth. Andrew
kicks the table and some sugar packets pop up in the air.

                    ANDREW
          Hey Aaron, it’s a popcorn skillet!

Aaron laughs and then he starts kicking the table too.

                    ANDREW/AARON
          Popcorn skillet! Popcorn skillet!

Randall feels the eyes of OTHER RESTAURANT-GOERS on him.

                    RANDALL
          Look boys! There’s a climbing
          structure! Inside a restaurant! Can
          you believe it?! GO! GO! GO!

The boys run off and join the many COUGHING KIDS on the
climbing structure. Randall rests his head on the table.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

Nicole enters to find Greg angrily trying to make the bed.

                    NICOLE
          Do you want to tell me why you’re
          upset, or do you just want to keep
          making the bed really badly?
                                                           69.


                    GREG
          Uhh, you let Amy go out on a school
          night and now she’s dressing like
          Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver. And
          you’re letting Marty stay home from
          school? You’re breaking every rule
          they gave us!

                    NICOLE
          You’re the one who let Marty sleep
          in the computer room!

                    GREG
          I know! Fine! I’m sorry!
              (sitting down on bed)
          This was supposed to be an easy
          win. The one time I might actually
          get one over on June. Make her eat
          shit for a change.

                    NICOLE
          Oh god, she didn’t actually make
          you eat shit as a boy, did she?

                    GREG
          She did things that cut a lot
          deeper. Mostly locked me in things.

                    NICOLE
          I still don’t get why your parents
          never stopped her.

                    GREG
          My dad was always traveling for
          work. And Mom... I don’t really
          know. It just shows you how good
          June was at hiding it. And I could
          never get her back. She was
          impenetrable.

                    NICOLE
          That’s a weird thing to say about
          your sister.

                    GREG
          Emotionally impenetrable! Nothing
          gets to her. It’s like she doesn’t
          feel anything...


INT. ART STUDIO - LATER

CLOSE ON: JUNE’S SOBBING FACE as she engages in more art
therapy.
                                                           70.


Once again, in front of TWO GIANT CANVASSES (from earlier
scene), but this time we actually see what she’s painting --
TWO CHILDHOOD PORTRAITS OF AMY & MARTY.

She sifts through the CHILDHOOD MEMORABILIA CHEST, pulling
out photos of AMY AND MARTY AT DISNEYLAND, BIRTHDAY PARTIES
AT PANCAKE PALACE.

She digs further and finds Amy and Marty’s CHILDHOOD ART
PROJECTS, and starts frantically pinning up their kid art on
the canvasses and painting around it.


INT. PANCAKE PALACE - LATER

Randall is asleep on the table when he’s jolted awake by the
sound of kids shouting “EW!” “GROSS!” He looks up and sees a
mass exodus of kids and parents from the climbing structure.

                    RANDALL
          Hey, what’s going on?

                    RANDOM PARENT
          Some poor kid just shit themselves
          at the top of the play area.

                    RANDALL
          Haha. Oh man, that is the worst.

Randall has a sinking feeling as only Andrew returns.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          No. No, no, no, no, no. Where’s
          your brother?

                    ANDREW
          He’s stuck at the top. He won’t
          come down. I think he had an
          accident.

Randall swears under his breath, trying to keep his cool.




INT. PANCAKE PALACE - CLIMBING STRUCTURE - MOMENTS LATER

Randall and Andrew stand at the bottom of the structure,
looking up at Aaron who is all the way at the top.

                    RANDALL
          Aaron? You gotta come down buddy!
                                                         71.


                    AARON
          I can’t move! There’s- aw! There’s
          more coming out!

                    RANDALL
          You gotta squeeze, bud! Don’t
          squeeze out, squeeze in!

Randall feels the prying eyes of other parents on him.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          Alright Andrew, you’re gonna have
          to go up there and bring him down.

                    ANDREW
          I’m not going near him. He pooed.

                    RANDALL
          I can’t fit in there. It has to be
          you. This is where you get to shine
          as the awesome big brother. You
          know? Really come through when your
          little brother needs you most. Real
          Avengers stuff!

Andrew sees the Waiter dropping off pancakes.

                      ANDREW
          Pancakes!

Andrew runs back to the table and starts eating. Randall
steels himself then starts CONTORTING his body to crawl up
the kid-sized openings to get to the top. On the way up,
Randall’s LEG SLIPS through a hole in the rope, giving him
ROPE BURN. He finally reaches the top and sees Aaron sitting
there, looking very embarrassed and upset.

                    RANDALL
          Hey, it’s okay. This kind of thing
          happens. There’s a whole expression
          dedicated to that.

Randall spots the only way down: A LARGE SLIDE.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          That’s how we get out of this. We
          slide.

                    AARON
          I don’t wanna slide on my bum.

                    RANDALL
          I don’t blame you. Here. I’ll just-
                                                        72.


Randall positions himself and Aaron at the edge of the slide.
He picks Aaron up and holds him in front like a bag of
rotting garbage. They slowly slide down together, the whole
restaurant watching them.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          Hey, take a picture. It’ll last
          longer.

Some people take out their phones and snap pictures.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          I take it back! Please don’t take
          pictures!

Randall carries Aaron back to the booth.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          Andrew, let’s go!

                    ANDREW
          I’m still eating.

                    RANDALL
          Just- we can bring it in the car!

                    ANDREW
          I’m not eating next to him!

Aaron starts crying, embarrassed. Randall struggles to keep
his cool.

                    RANDALL
          Andrew, help me out, dude!

Andrew ignores Randall. Finally, Randall GRABS Andrew’s arm
and drags him out of the booth. Andrew resists.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          YOU WON’T WALK? FINE!

Randall picks up Andrew and carries him under his arm,
surfboard style. He carries under his other arm. He calls out
to the restaurant.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          Just for the record, these aren’t
          my kids!


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Nicole walks out of the bathroom, wearing a towel, post-
shower. She’s startled to find Marty, standing right there.
                                                        73.


                    NICOLE
          AHHHHHHH!!! Marty what are you
          doing?

                    MARTY
          16 minutes. That’s how long your
          shower was.

                    NICOLE
          Were you... timing me?

                    MARTY
          Did you know that for every minute
          in the shower, you use 2.5 gallons
          of water? You just wasted 40
          gallons.

                    NICOLE
          I wouldn’t say I wasted it.

                    MARTY
          I bet you left the water running to
          warm it up.

                    NICOLE
          I mean, obviously I’m not getting
          in a cold shower-

                    MARTY
          What would Greta Thunberg do in
          this situation? I bet she’d go on a
          shower strike to make up for all
          the water you just wasted.

Marty walks off. He already smells pretty bad.

                    NICOLE
          No she wouldn’t, Marty! She’d want
          to look presentable to the UN!
          Please, you’re already... so ripe.

Nicole continues down the hallway into-


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

- her bedroom. She checks her phone by the bedside table and
sees a TEXT from Amy: “Not home for dinner. Going to study
group”. Nicole gets a bad feeling...
                                                        74.


INT. CASH ONLY DRY CLEANING - CONTINUOUS

A CASHIER hands Greg his suit. Greg opens his WALLET to pay
but it’s empty.

                    GREG
          Huh. Could’ve sworn I took out cash
          yesterday...

The CASHIER’s heard this before. He takes the suit out of
Greg’s hands. Greg gets a bad feeling...


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - LATER

Greg and Nicole are pacing in their kitchen.

                    GREG
          This girl is out of control! She’s
          stealing from us now?! What the
          hell does she need $80 for?

                     NICOLE
          Not for study group. I’ll tell you
          that much.
              (then)
          There is a way to find out.

                    GREG
          How?

                    NICOLE
          These goddamn tweens document every
          waking moment on social media. They
          can’t help themselves.

                    GREG
          Are you suggesting we spy on her?

                    NICOLE
          Well don’t just come out and say it
          like that! But yes. Think about it.
          If we had access to that, we could
          watch her 24 hours a day if we
          want.

                    GREG
          That sounds... intense.

                    NICOLE
              (defensive)
          Maybe it’s time to up the intensity
          level, Greg! Who knows what this
          girl is getting up to?
                    (MORE)
                                                           75.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
          What if something happens to her?
          You think June would ever let you
          live that down? Huh?!

                    GREG
              (triggered)
          ALRIGHT LET’S SPY ON HER! How are
          we gonna do that though? Don’t we
          need her passwords?

                       NICOLE
          Yeah...


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - OFFICE - LATER

Greg and Nicole stand in front of Marty.

                    MARTY
          Sure, I can hack her social media.

                    NICOLE
          Really? Just like that?

                    MARTY
          Yeah, she’s a dick to me. But
          obviously I want something in
          return.

                       NICOLE
          Like what?

                    MARTY
          Oh, I’ll make a list.

Greg and Nicole agree. Marty starts trying out different
passwords.


I/E. OLSEN HOUSE - GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

June pulls into the garage, which doubles as her HOME ART
STUDIO. She sets up her TWO LARGE CANVASSES, admires them,
then enters the house-


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - CONTINUOUS

- where she finds the boys on the couch, watching TV. Randall
is sitting in a dark room, hunched over and weary.

                    JUNE
          Hey, how long have they been parked
          in front of the TV?
                                      76.


          RANDALL
I don’t know. As soon as we got
home. Sort of lost track of time.

          JUNE
Jesus. What happened to you?

          RANDALL
What happened to me? Uhhh, they
wouldn’t stop fighting, they
weren’t listening-

          JUNE
I feel like the trick when they’re
not listening is to just not take
it personally and to, you know, be
present with them.

          RANDALL
Oh I was present. I was present
when Aaron shit himself on the
climbing structure. I was present
when I had to physically carry him
down from there. And I was
certainly present when I had to
wash off the back of his legs in a
Chipotle bathroom when three other
restaurants wouldn’t let us inside
because the boy wasn’t up to code.

          JUNE
Well he seems fine now. Hey, I’m
gonna Facetime Greg in a few
minutes.

          RANDALL
What? No. Why?

          JUNE
I want to see how our kids are
doing. Also, I want to ambush him.
    (eyeing Randall)
Hmm. Maybe we should put some
sunglasses on you, you look pretty
tired.

          RANDALL
I’m extremely tired. And this isn’t
Weekend at Bernie’s. You can’t just
slap some sunglasses and a Hawaiian
on me and use me as a prop to
pretend everything’s fine.
                                                        77.


                    JUNE
          Oooo, Hawaiian shirts. That’s
          actually a pretty good idea.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - OFFICE - LATER

Greg and Nicole are reading Marty’s LIST.

                    NICOLE
          No single-use plastic water
          bottles. Fine. No red meat.

                    GREG
          No leather. Easy.

                    MARTY
          What’s your belt made out of?

Greg begrudgingly takes off his belt and tosses it.

                    NICOLE
          Sponsor a polar bear. Is that even
          possible?

                    GREG
          Five-minute joint showers.
              (sotto; to Nicole)
          That ones not bad. I could help you-

                    NICOLE
              (sotto; to Greg)
          I don’t need help washing my boobs.
              (to Marty)
          We agree to your terms!

Nicole clicks the LOG IN button. They’re in. On Amy’s
Instagram feed, they see a DM FROM AMY to Jasmine and her
other friends “MANI-PEDIS ON ME!!!!”

                    GREG
          What the- those mani-pedis are on
          me! What are all these pig emojis?

                    NICOLE
          I think that’s her friends
          squealing in delight.

They flip through and find MANY PHOTOS of Amy and her friends
getting mani-pedis, smoothies and shopping.

                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          Study group, my ass. Ya busted.
                                                          78.


Then Greg gets a FACETIME CALL FROM JUNE.

                    GREG
          Oh god. It’s June!

                    NICOLE
          Well don’t pick up.

                    GREG
          I have to! If I don’t, it’ll look
          like a sign of weakness. She’ll
          think something is up!

                    NICOLE
          Something is up. Amy isn’t home.
          She’s not even supposed to be out
          on a school night.

                    GREG
          Well we can’t let June know that!
              (frantically; to Marty)
          Marty! You know how we’re
          sponsoring a polar bear? You get us
          through this call, we’ll get you 10
          polar bears. Like a whole polar
          bear baseball team. Yeah?

Marty shrugs and nods. Good enough. Greg answers.

                    GREG (CONT’D)
          HELLO HELLO HELLO!!

                    JUNE (O.S.)
          Aloha! Just thought we’d check-in.
          We’re having a casual Luau night.

ON FACETIME, June, Randall, and the boys are all dressed in
Hawaiian shirts and sunglasses, looking like a happy family.

                    GREG
          Looking very casual and not
          remotely staged.

                    ANDREW/AARON
          HI MOM!! HI DAD!!

                    NICOLE
          How are you boys doing?

                                              INTERCUT WITH:
                                                        79.


INT. OLSENS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

They are all huddled at the table, as Hawaiian music plays.

                    AARON
          Having the best time ever!

                    ANDREW
          Aunt June and Uncle Randall are the
          best!

                    AARON
          We love it here!

                    ANDREW
          We don’t want to leave!

Under the table, we see June rewarding each nice comment with
a Hershey’s Kiss.

                    JUNE
          Boys that’s so- wow!

                    ANDREW
          Having the best time ever!

                    NICOLE
          Yeah... you already said that, hun.

Aaron drops his chocolate and bends down to get them. His
sunglasses fall off his face, revealing his BLACK EYE. June
recovers the sunglasses and puts them on his face before he’s
back in frame. Close call.

                    GREG
          Randall’s being a little quiet. Hey
          Randall! How’s it really going?

                    RANDALL
          You know. It’s... a lot.
              (off June’s death stare)
          - of fun! A lot of fun. Otherwise
          why would I be wearing this shirt?

                    JUNE
          Alright enough about us, where’s
          Amy and Marty?

                    GREG
          Marty’s right here, I think Amy’s
          in her room. Let me just get her.

Greg gets up and hands Marty the phone.
                                                        80.


                    RANDALL
          Hey buddy! How’s it going?

Greg scrambles around the kitchen behind the phone, looking
for a pen and paper. He settles on the boys’ dry erase board
and starts writing talking points: “ALL IS WELL.”

                    MARTY
          All is well.

But it sounds more like Marty is stiffly reading a prepared
hostage statement.

                    RANDALL
          Ah. Okay. How was school today?

Marty freezes. Greg furiously writes: “LIE!!!”

                     MARTY
          I went to school. I was there the
          whole day.

                    RANDALL
          K, you’re not really giving us a
          lot here. Is that it?

Nicole looks out the window and sees Amy approaching. She
mouths: “She’s back!” Greg gives Marty the “stretch it out”
gesture to buy more time. Marty’s confused.

                    MARTY
          We... made pizza dough?

                    JUNE
          What?

                     NICOLE
          Yeah apparently it was make-you-own-
          pizza day at school.
              (then)
          Hey look who’s out of her room!

Amy enters. Greg takes the phone back and is about to point
it at Amy. He notices the inappropriate outfit she’s wearing
and throws the phone to the ground.

                    GREG
          Whoops! Dropped the phone.

Greg “struggles” to pick it up, waiting for Amy to enter her
room. SLAM! He picks it up, pointing it at the closed door.
                                                        81.


                    GREG (CONT’D)
          And there she goes back in her
          room. That’s teenage life for ya.

                    JUNE
          Open the door, we want to see her.

                    NICOLE
          Yeah, we actually like to respect
          her privacy. It’s a trust thing,
          you understand.

Nicole sees that her laptop is still open to Amy’s Instagram,
and quickly shuts it. Greg knocks on Amy’s door.

                    GREG
          Hey Amy, we just need a quick proof-
          of-life.

                       AMY (O.S.)
          I’m alive.

                    GREG
          There you have it! Alive and happy.
          No one’s tapping out over here.

                    JUNE
          No one’s tapping out on this end
          either.

                    GREG
          Great. Glad to hear it. Bye boys!

Greg hangs up the phone and starts hyperventilating.


I/E. YOUNG HOUSE - AMY’S ROOM - SOON AFTER

Nicole and Greg knock and slowly open the door.

                    NICOLE
          So... how was study group?

                       AMY
          Fine.

                    GREG
          Yeah? What were you guys studying?

                    AMY
          Covalent bonds.
                                                        82.


                    NICOLE
          Mmmm, love those. What did you
          learn about them?

                    AMY
          That they’re stronger than...
          common bonds.

A beat. Greg and Nicole look at each other, unsure.

                    GREG
              (covering)
          Right. Yeah, way stronger.

                    NICOLE
          Your nails look really pretty.

                    AMY
          Thanks. Jasmine did them. Can you
          guys leave me alone now please?

They slink off, apologetically, closing the door behind them.

                    NICOLE
          You didn’t confront her.

                    GREG
          Neither did you.

                    NICOLE
          I chickened out. I think I’m afraid
          of her.

                     GREG
          Me too.
              (then)
          Common bonds? Is that even a thing?
              (looks it up on phone)
          It isn’t!

                    NICOLE
          God, if we were just a little
          smarter we could have called her on
          it. Now it’s too late.

                    GREG
          I hate physics!

                       NICOLE
          Chemistry.

                    GREG
          Whatever! I hate school!
                                                          83.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

Randall and June are awoken by a STRANGE BARKING SOUND.

                    JUNE
          What is that? Did our neighbors get
          a pet seal?

                    RANDALL
          Oh god. It’s coming from the boys’
          room. I think it’s a cough.

                    JUNE
          It sounds like croup.

More barking coughs. This time on top of each other.

                    RANDALL
          This is getting ridiculous! We
          can’t do this anymore!

June takes out her phone and starts checking WebMD.

                    JUNE
          Yes we can! Says here the best home
          treatment is to take your child
          outside to get cold air into their
          lungs. We can handle this.


EXT. OLSEN HOUSE - BACKYARD - SOON AFTER

Randall and June are outside in their PJs, shivering, holding
the two coughing boys. June wears oven mitts and turns her
face away, to keep the germs at bay.

                    RANDALL
          I’m s-s-so c-c-cold.

Aaron turns his head and coughs in Randall’s face.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          Ah! He got me! I swallowed it!

The Boys laugh which only makes them cough harder.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

The alarm beeps. Randall and June wake up after another
sleepless night. Randall starts COUGHING and SNEEZING.
                                                          84.


                    RANDALL
          Oh god. I think I’m sick.
          Everything hurts.

MORE COUGHS from the other room. Randall’s eyes suddenly
widen and he rolls out of bed to feebly get dressed for work.

                    JUNE
          You’re still going in to work?

                    RANDALL
          No way I’m staying here...
              (off June’s look)
          What? I can’t take this many sick
          days in a row.

                    JUNE
          But you’re actually sick. Seems
          like you shouldn’t be going in if
          you’re feeling this bad.

                    RANDALL
          Right. Are you saying that out of
          concern for me? Or concern for
          yourself, having to deal with two
          sick kids all day.

                    JUNE
          Concern for you. I’ll be fine.

                    RANDALL
          Then so will I.

Randall ties his tie, sneezes on it, then has to change it.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

Nicole is showering at breakneck speed.

                    NICOLE
          She’s a sociopath. She lied right
          to my face, like a little teenaged
          Robert Durst.

                    GREG (O.S.)
          But worse...

REVEAL Greg is huddled in the corner of the shower, not
getting any of the warm water.
                                                        85.


                    GREG (CONT’D)
          ... even Durst had a tell: the
          burping. Amy didn’t even blink, let
          alone burp.

                    NICOLE
          At least when the boys lie, I know
          it. Shuffling their feet, evading
          eye contact. God, I miss the way
          they lie.

                    GREG
          So do I. So simple, so sweet. I
          hate to admit it, but June was
          right. Kids get older, they get
          smart, and then they use those
          smarts to manipulate you-

BANG! BANG! BANG! Greg and Nicole, clutch each other,
cowering at the sound of banging on the door.

                    MARTY (O.S.)
          That’s five minutes!!

Nicole scrambles to turn off the shower.

                    NICOLE
          It’s off, Marty!

Greg still has soap suds all over him.

                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          This kid’s going to school today.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - KID’S BEDROOM - MORNING

June opens the door and pokes her head inside their room.

                    JUNE
          Alright boys. Who’s ready for fun?

The boys COUGH and SNEEZE. They look disgusting. This is not
going to be a fun day.

QUICK CUTS OF JUNE DEALING WITH NEEDY KIDS:

- She feeds the boys breakfast. They’re sneezing all over
their food and the table. June tries to hide her disgust.

                    ANDREW
          I can’t taste my fruit loops.
                                                        86.


Andrew WHINES. June moves in to console him but pats him on
the back instead. Then she promptly washes her hands.

- The boys get up from the breakfast table, wiping their
snotty hands on everything. June follows behind, SANITIZING
everything they touch.

- Andrew builds a LEGO tower. He sneezes and his hand topples
the structure. Frustrated, he starts WHINING and purposely
THROWING his Lego across the room. Before she can go help
Andrew, she hears a cry from the bathroom:

                    AARON (O.S.)
          Aunt Juuune! I’m done! I need a
          wipe!

- This devolves into a series of COUGHS, SNEEZES and WHINEY
CRIES FOR “AUNT JUNE”. We can see the unrelenting need and
the overall grossness is getting to her.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

June holds out TWO BANDANAS in front of the boys. She’s also
wearing one to cover her nose and mouth.

                    JUNE
          Who wants to play a fun game of
          Bandits?

                    AARON
          What’s a bandit?

                    JUNE
          Bandits were robbers. They didn’t
          care about the law, didn’t care
          about the rules. The only thing
          they cared about was wearing
          bandanas over their mouths and
          noses at all times. No matter what.

June starts tying bandanas around the boys’ faces, careful to
avoid any airborne germs.

                    AARON
          How do we play?

                    JUNE
          Well, bandits LOVED robbing trains.
          So, let’s say this couch is a
          train. And you don’t want to leave
          the train because that’s where the
          loot is.
                                                        87.


                    ANDREW
          I don’t get it. What’s the loot?

                    JUNE
          Avengers cartoons.
              (turning on the show)
          Now binge! Binge the loot! Don’t
          get off the train!

June ducks into the Garage/Art Studio and closes the door.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - GARAGE / ART STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

June takes off her mask and takes a deep breath, relieved.
She hears more COUGHING and puts in some EAR BUDS to drown it
out with music. Then she focuses on her TWO ART PIECES.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

Greg is about to head out to work. Nicole is at the table.

                    GREG
          Alright, I have a 4:00, so I’ll see
          you after dinner. Love you.

Nicole doesn’t even react, completely fixated on her laptop.

                    GREG (CONT’D)
          Nicole?

                    NICOLE
              (not listening)
          Yeah, sure, salmon for dinner.

The laptop is open to AMY’S INSTAGRAM, FACEBOOK and TIK TOK.

                    GREG
          Whoa. You’ve gone full Homeland.

                     NICOLE
          She’s already posted three videos
          and changed her status twice in the
          last hour.
              (then)
          Ohh! Jasmine just started another
          group chat! Looks like someone’s
          planning on skipping 5th period.

Greg loosens his tie and sits down next to Nicole.
                                                        88.


                    GREG
          I can get Malcolm to cover for me
          at work. This is more important.
          Should I put on a pot of coffee?

                    NICOLE
          Marty threw away all our beans.
          Apparently, they aren’t “ethical”
          enough? He wants fair trade.

                    GREG
          Fair trade. I’m starting to think
          this kid swap wasn’t a fair trade.


INT. OFFICE BUILDING - LATER

Randall walks down the hallway, shivering and trying to
stifle his sneezing. He manages to avoid his CO-WORKERS and
sneak into his office where he curls up on his couch to rest.
Just as he settles in, there’s a KNOCK on his office door.

                    RANDALL’S BOSS
          Are you sick? You know you’re not
          supposed to be here if you are.

Busted. Randall gets up from the couch, disappointed.

                    RANDALL
          K, I’ll go home and sleep it off.


INT. PARKING LOT - RANDALL’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Randall lies uncomfortably in the back seat of his car, using
his suit jacket as a blanket. He shivers himself to sleep.


INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

Marty walks the halls: plastic water bottles everywhere, a
TEACHER throwing stacks of paper into the garbage instead of
the recycle bin.


INT. SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - SOON AFTER

In line, Marty sees all the styrofoam containers and food
waste. A STUDENT throws some trash in an overflowing garbage
can. It falls to the floor. Fed up, Marty grabs the garbage
can, climbs on a table, and DUMPS THE GARBAGE ON THE
CAFETERIA FLOOR. Everyone turns to the commotion.
                                                        89.


                    MARTY
          Oh, so when it’s a big enough mess
          you do notice! Well we’re in a
          mess. The whole world is a mess.
          And it’s up to us to clean it up!
          Our parents, our teachers, our
          uncles, our aunts just want to
          sweep it all under the rug and
          pretend everything’s okay. How DARE
          YOU! You have stolen our futures!
          And we’re going to do something
          about it! WE’RE WALKING OUT!!

Marty gets down from the table with purpose. Then notices
that no one is following him.

                    MARTY (CONT’D)
          Well don’t just stand there,
          drinking out of your single-use
          plastic water bottles.

CLONK! Marty gets struck in the head with a half-full water
bottle. Then another. Then another. Marty ducks out of the
cafeteria as water bottles rain down on him.

                    MARTY (CONT’D)
          Really? Nobody? Ow!

On the way out, Marty spots a FIRE ALARM. He pulls the lever.
All the students start rushing for the exits.

                    MARTY (CONT’D)
          There’s your goddamn walk-out!


INT. CAR - BACKSEAT - DAY

A SELFIE VIDEO OF AMY, JASMINE, AND TWO OTHER GIRLS.

                    JASMINE
          So we’re all heading to the mall to
          get our noses pierced. It’s going
          to be super cute.

The camera turns to Amy, who’s filming the video.

                    AMY
          We’re all gonna look like Halsey!

They all cheer!
                                                          90.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Greg and Nicole stare at the laptop, in horror.


I/E. MINIVAN - MOMENTS LATER

Nicole PEELS OUT of the driveway, driving erratically.

                    GREG
          We cannot let this girl put a hole
          in her face while she’s under our
          care!

PING! Greg clicks on the latest video of all the girls
singing Halsey’s “Eastside”.

                    GREG (CONT’D)
          It’s a clue! They’re getting
          pierced on the east side of town.

                    NICOLE
          Just- play it back! Landmarks!
          Street signs!

Greg plays the video back, PAUSES ON A STREET SIGN.

                    GREG
          They’re heading west! On Olympic!


INT. MINIVAN - SOON AFTER

PING! A photo of all the girls, this time in front of a
PIERCING-TATTOO PARLOR.


INT. MALL - PARKING LOT - SOON AFTER

Nicole skids to a stop, parking between two spaces.


INT. MALL - SOON AFTER

Greg and Nicole run through SHOPPERS, and burst into-


INT. MALL - PIERCING/TATTOO PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

                      NICOLE/GREG
          STOP!!!!!
                                                           91.


The SCREAM startles everyone, including the Piercers and
Tattoo Artists working on customers. One PATRON gets an
accidental piercing through the cheek!

                    PATRON
          AHHHH!!

The OWNER steps forward, furious.

                    OWNER
          What are you doing?!

                    GREG
          Sorry about your cheek, sir. Ugh,
          that looks bad.

                    AMY
          Uncle Greg?

Amy steps out and Greg rushes over, inspecting her nose.

                    GREG
          Oh thank god. It’s still intact.

                    AMY
          What are you- how did you know I
          was here?

Greg and Nicole look to each other, unsure what to say.

                    NICOLE
          We were at the Build-a-Bear
          station. Building bears. And then
          saw you here. Happy accident.

Jasmine gleefully takes a video of the whole scene and posts
it online. Amy’s phone PINGS. So does Nicole’s. Amy snatches
Nicole’s phone, and sees her Instagram profile up.

                    AMY
          You hacked me?!

                    NICOLE
          You know what... yes we did. Yes.
          We. Did. And I’m glad we did! Cuz
          you are OUT OF CONTROL!

                    AMY
          I can’t believe I ever said you
          were cool. You are so much worse
          than my parents!

                    NICOLE
          Take that back!
                                                           92.


                    AMY
          No!

                    NICOLE
          Oh yeah?! You wanna see me be worse
          than your parents? How’s this?!
          Greg! Grab her!

                    GREG
          What are you, The Penguin? Why are
          you ordering me to do it?

Nicole grabs Amy’s arms and starts DRAGGING HER OUT OF THE
STORE. Amy resists. Greg reluctantly helps, grabbing Amy’s
legs. They carry her away as Amy thrashes.

                    AMY
          Ahhhh! I’m being abducted! These
          aren’t my parents!

                    GREG
          We’re related though!

Greg and Nicole hurry past SEVERAL BYSTANDERS.

                    NICOLE
          It’s kind of disturbing how
          nobody’s trying to help her.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - GARAGE / ART STUDIO - LATER

June stands back and admires her completed art pieces.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

June exits her studio, a little shocked to find the boys
aren’t on the couch. No sign of them anywhere.

                    JUNE
          Uhhh, boys?

She then hears footsteps and coughing coming from upstairs.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

She reaches the landing. All the upstairs CUPBOARDS AND
DRAWERS ARE OPEN. The house looks like its been robbed. She
looks into her bedroom, and sees Andrew - still wearing the
bandana over his face - stuffing jewelry into his pillow
case. He sees her and stops in his tracks.
                                                         93.


                    ANDREW
          It’s the Sheriff! Hide the loot!

Andrew slams the door on her, LOCKING IT.

                    JUNE
          No! I’m not the Sheriff! I’m a
          fellow bandit!
              (banging on door)
          Andrew, open the door, please.

June is exasperated but keeps her emotions in check.

                    JUNE (CONT’D)
          I bet you can’t open it by the
          count of three. One. Two. Three.
              (nothing)
          See? I was right.
              (then; a bit panicked)
          Please don’t cough on my things.

Behind June, Aaron tiptoes down the stairs, holding his own
full pillow case.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - GARAGE / ART STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

Aaron looks for a place to hide his loot. He spots a KILN,
curiously, starts tinkering with the dials and knobs.

                    JUNE (O.S.)
          AARON! Are you hiding? Come out,
          come out, wherever you are.

Aaron hides his pillow case inside the kiln.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

June sees her bedroom doorknob has a pin-hole in the middle.
She runs her fingers on the top of the door frame, searching
for the pin to open the door. Nothing there.

                    JUNE
          Andrew, can you at least cough on
          Uncle Randall’s side of the bed?

As she rushes to the bathroom and searches for a bobby-pin,
she suddenly catches a whiff of something in the air.

                    JUNE (CONT’D)
          Is- is something burning?
                                                        94.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

June bounds down the stairs sees SMOKE coming out from under
her ART STUDIO DOOR. June looks around, panicked.

                    JUNE
          Aaron!? Where are you?!


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - ART STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

June opens the door. THE KILN IS ON FIRE! The flames have
spread and her two ART PIECES are engulfed!

                       JUNE
          Oh my god-

June grabs a FIRE EXTINGUISHER and sprays the Kiln and the
art pieces, managing to put out the fire. The smoke clears
and June stares at the CHARRED REMAINS of her children’s art.
In shock, she opens the kiln and finds a burnt pillow case
inside. Andrew and Aaron stand in the doorway.

                    AARON
          I... just wanted to hide my loot.

                     JUNE
          You... just wanted... to hide...
          your loot.

June finally SNAPS.

                    JUNE (CONT’D)
          AHHHHHHHHHHH!!

Aaron is so terrified, he starts crying. Then Andrew. June
realizes her screams are making the kids cry, so she stops.
After a beat, she can’t help herself and screams again:

                    JUNE (CONT’D)
          AHHHHHHHHHH!!!

Andrew and Aaron run away from the room, scared.


EXT. MINIVAN - LATER

Nicole, Greg and Amy drive in silence. As they pull up to the
house, they find Marty sitting on the stoop, upset.

                    NICOLE
          Why are you home from school?
                                                95.


                    MARTY
          I... just wanted people to listen.

                     GREG
          That’s the scariest thing you could
          have said.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

Greg and Nicole pace in their room.

                    GREG
          I can’t believe he got suspended.

                     NICOLE
          I can. Preachy little shit.
              (beat)
          I do feel responsible though. He’s
          really upset.

                    GREG
          Not as upset as Amy.

                     NICOLE
          Seems like they’re a lot worse off
          now than before we became their
          guardians.

Greg sits on side of the bed, shell-shocked.

                     GREG
          I wanted to beat June so bad that I
          never really thought about the
          impact it was having on their
          lives.
              (then)
          She’s just always made me feel like
          such a loser... and, you know what,
          she’s right. I am a loser.

                    NICOLE
          No you’re not. Don’t say that.

                    GREG
          Why? It’s true. I’m a failure. I’m
          a failure at home - I barely get to
          spend time with the kids and when I
          do, they don’t respect me or even
          listen to me.

                    NICOLE
          They don’t listen to anybody. And
          you’re not a failure at home.
                    (MORE)
                                                  96.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
          You’re a good father who loves his
          kids and is doing his best.

                    GREG
          Well I’m a failure at work. You
          gave up your job and it was on me
          to take care of the business and
          look how well that turned out.
          Like, you wonder why I had such a
          hard time accepting help from you -
          it’s because it just reminded me
          how I couldn’t hold up my end.
              (beat; ashamed)
          I just wanted to get the kids into
          preschool for you.

Greg feels the full weight of his failure.

                    NICOLE
          Honestly, maybe it’s for the best
          that the kids stay home. I mean,
          this week I had time to myself and
          I didn’t even know what to do with
          it. I jumped right back into mom
          mode. But maybe that’s just my role
          and it’s fine.
              (resigned)
          The kids are just my life now.

                    GREG
          That can’t be your only role. You
          deserve a life outside of them too.

Nicole gets emotional.

                    NICOLE
          I wonder what they’re doing right
          now. I miss them.

                    GREG
          Remember how you could hug them
          after a hard day and it would make
          everything alright in that moment?

                    NICOLE
          Yeah.

Greg and Nicole inch closer and hug each other.

                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          It’s not the same.

                    GREG
          Not even close.
                                                        97.


I/E. OLSENS HOUSE - LATER

Randall returns, sick and exhausted. He sees the boys on the
couch, watching TV, and feels vindicated. Then he hears some
movement in the garage and heads there.


INT. OLSEN HOUSE - GARAGE/ART STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

                    RANDALL
          So, how long have the boys been
          parked in front of the-
              (noticing fire damage)
          OH MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED HERE?!

Randall surveys the damage around the room. He then spots
June on her knees, huddled in the corner. Before he can
unleash a tirade, he notices there’s TEARS IN HER EYES.

                     RANDALL (CONT’D)
              (taken aback)
          You’re crying.
              (beat)
          What did these kids do to you?

                    JUNE
          It’s not them. It’s them.

June picks up some charred pieces of Amy and Marty’s kid art.
Randall gets on his knees and joins her.

                    JUNE (CONT’D)
          It’s like they’re not even kids
          anymore. They don’t need us. They
          don’t even want us around.

As June breaks down, Randall is overwhelmed, realizing that
June feels the exact same way as him.

                    RANDALL
          I had no idea you felt this way.

                    JUNE
          My childhood was cut so short. And
          it kills me to know that theirs is
          ending. They’re growing up so fast.
          I just wish I could make it stop.

                    RANDALL
          Maybe that’s the problem. We can’t
          stop them from growing up. It’s
          happening whether we like it or
          not.
                                                           98.


Randall’s eyes drift to some of the charred kid art pieces.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          This is Marty’s. He made this for
          me for Father’s Day. And those are
          Amy’s hippogriffs. What were you
          doing with these?

                    JUNE
          Oh you know. Trying to hold onto a
          time that I can never get back.

Randall sees the burnt canvasses, realizes what June was
working on.

                    RANDALL
          It burning to ashes at your feet
          really drives that point home.

                    JUNE
          It was a pointless endeavor. Kinda
          like this whole week.

                    RANDALL
          I wouldn’t say that. At least the
          two of us got to spend some time
          together.

                    JUNE
          That’s true. I had a lot of fun
          with you. At least for the first 36
          hours.

                    RANDALL
          Amy and Marty are gonna drift away
          from us. That’s what kids do. I
          just don’t want us to drift away
          from each other.

                    JUNE
          Neither do I.

They hug each other on the floor. Then they hear Andrew and
Aaron yelling in the other room.

                    JUNE (CONT’D)
          Ugh. These kids are the worst.

                    RANDALL
          Thank you so much for finally
          admitting that.
                                                        99.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING

Greg stares at the phone in his hand.

                    NICOLE
          Okay, you’re holding the phone.
          That’s step one. Now, just call
          your sister, and tell her we’re
          tapping out.

                    GREG
              (stalling)
          Okay. 3. 1. 0. That’s the area code-

Fed up, Nicole grabs the phone, and starts dialing. The phone
rings. Then they hear the sound of a PHONE RINGING coming
from their front porch.


I/E. YOUNG HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Greg opens the door. Andrew and Aaron barrel past him, and
jump all over Nicole, kissing her like faithful dogs. She
hugs them tight.

                    NICOLE
          Oh! My boys! I missed you so much!

Greg watches their reunion, feeling left out. Then the boys
run over to hug him too. He scoops them up, happy to have
them back.

Then, June and Randall enter, looking very run down.

                    GREG
          Well, well, well... look who
          finally caved.

                    JUNE
          I just got a phone call from you,
          what was that about?

                    GREG
          Just a butt dial. You two look like
          shit, by the way.

                    NICOLE
          Did you boys have fun destroying
          your aunt and uncle?

Nicole rubs Aaron’s cheek and some MAKE-UP comes off.

                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          What’s on your face?
                                                       100.


Nicole rubs off more make-up revealing AARON’S BLACK EYE.

                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          Wha- what happened to your eye?

                    JUNE
          It’s nothing, just a little bump.

                    AARON
          They set up a boxing ring for us to
          fight in and Andrew knocked me out!

                    RANDALL
          Not “out”, just down.

                    GREG
          You sanctioned a fight between
          them?

                    ANDREW
          And they let us watch as many shows
          as we wanted! Way more than you
          guys!

Greg and Nicole look at June and Randall, smugly.

                    GREG
          Really? Way more than us, you say?

June is stewing, not used to being on the receiving end of
criticism. Especially from her little brother.

                    RANDALL
              (quietly to June)
          It’s okay. Let’s just take our
          lumps. It’s gonna be fine.

                    AARON
          We were also in a fire!

                     GREG / NICOLE
          WHAT?!?!

                    RANDALL
          In fairness... I wasn’t there for
          that one. June?

                    JUNE
          Everything was fine! No one got
          hurt!
                                                          101.


                     NICOLE
          Well any insecurities I had about
          being a bad parent have completely
          gone away.

                    GREG
          I couldn’t agree more. And based on
          the fact that you showed up on our
          doorstep, and not the other way
          around, it’s fair to say we just
          won the kid swap.
              (to June)
          Which means you lose! Wouldn’t you
          agree, June?

Everyone’s eyes, including Randall’s, are on June who’s
mustering up the courage to admit she lost. Then-

                      MARTY (O.S.)
          Mom? Dad?

June and Randall pull Marty in for a hug. They recoil.

                    RANDALL
          Oof. Buddy. You’re not smelling the
          freshest.

                    MARTY
          I’ve been on a shower strike to
          protest the over-consumption of
          water in this house.

                     JUNE
          Okay. Where did you get an idea
          like that?

Marty looks over at Greg and Nicole, unsure what to say.

                    MARTY
          I’m not supposed to say...

                    GREG
          Well you’re not supposed to say
          that either.
              (to June and Randall)
          He may have picked up a few little
          ideas... online.

                    RANDALL
          Online? You gave him internet
          access?
                                                      102.


                    MARTY
          They let me sleep in the computer
          room.

June and Randall stare angrily at Greg and Nicole.

                    GREG
          We have a small house! Where were
          we supposed to put him?

                    RANDALL
          You take the computer out of the
          room.

            NICOLE                           GREG
Yup. We should’ve done that.    He’s a good negotiator!

                    MARTY
          Am I in trouble?

                    JUNE
          No, honey, whatever happened this
          week isn’t your fault. It’s theirs.

                    MARTY
          Okay good. Cuz I also got suspended
          from school.

                    RANDALL
          WHAT?!

                    JUNE
              (shaking her head; Greg)
          Wow. You knew he was suspended and
          yet you still tried to pretend like
          you were the winner. That’s sad.

                    RANDALL
          Where’s Amy? This kid swap is over!

June and Randall storm down the hallway.

                     MARTY
          Wow. You guys really called it
          that, huh?


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

June and Randall knock on the door.

                    JUNE
          Amy, honey? We’re leaving!
                                                       103.


They open the door. The room is empty.

                    RANDALL
          Where is she?

Greg and Nicole are just as confused.

                    GREG
          Uhhhh. She was here last night.
              (to Nicole)
          Have you seen her?

                    RANDALL
          You’re asking each other?!

                    JUNE
          Oh my god. You don’t know where she
          is...

All the air suddenly leaves the room.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - VARIOUS - MOMENTS LATER

PANIC MODE as everyone searches the house, frantically and
tries calling Amy’s phone, to no avail.

                    RANDALL
          I just called the school. She’s not
          there.

                    JUNE
          When did you last see her?

                    NICOLE
          Yesterday? Around 4?

                    JUNE
          She didn’t come out of her room
          after that?

                    GREG
          She was upset with us.

                    RANDALL
          What did you do?

                    GREG
          We hacked her social media.
              (suddenly hopeful)
          We hacked her social media! We can
          track her using that!
                                                         104.


Nicole scrambles for her phone and tries logging into Amy’s
Instagram. Password denied.

                    NICOLE
          Nevermind, she changed her
          password.

                    RANDALL
          Where would she go?!

Everyone thinks about this and reaches the same conclusion.

         GREG/NICOLE                      JUNE/RANDALL
Jasmine’s.                       Jasmine’s.


EXT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - LATER

The families pull up to the house in separate cars. They rush
to Jasmine’s front door and pound on it. XANDER answers,
looking sleepy or high or both.

                       XANDER
          Hey.

                       NICOLE
          Hi Xander.

June and Randall look confused as to how Nicole knows him.

                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          We’re looking for Amy. Again. Is
          she here?

                    XANDER
          Yeah, she slept here last night.
          Think she’s in the basement.
              (calling out)
          Yo Amy!

The parents all breathe a HUGE SIGH OF RELIEF.

                    XANDER (CONT’D)
          Oh wait. What time is it? My bad.
          They left hours ago.

                    RANDALL
          Left?! To where?
                                                         105.


INT. MINIVAN - MOMENTS LATER

Both families are now piled into the minivan. The mood is
very tense as they pull onto the I-10: Gridlock. Randall
checks his phone.

                    RANDALL
          Shit. It’s red for the next,
          uhhh... Until Coachella.

                    JUNE
          Ohh Amy, please be okay...

                    AMY (PRE-LAP)
          WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!


EXT. COCHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - DAY

Amy and her friends are celebrating in line. They’re all
decked out in wild Coachella outfits, slathered in glitter,
beads in their hair. Jasmine hands out WRISTBANDS.

                    JASMINE
          My dad got us VIP wristbands! We
          basically have the same access as
          the Hadids.

                    AMY & FRIENDS
          WOOOOO!!!!!

Amy’s phone buzzes. She sees dozens of MISSED CALLS AND TEXTS
from all the parents. She ignores it and puts her phone away.


INT. MINIVAN - MUCH LATER

They’re still stuck in traffic. Marty sits in the back
between the boys, playing video games. The boys watch.

                    RANDALL
          She’s not answering any of my
          texts.

                       NICOLE
          Me either.

The parents sit in tense silence for a moment.

                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          We can’t even tell you how sorry we
          are.
                                                        106.


Greg is almost too ashamed to speak. He catches June’s gaze
in the rearview and casts his eyes down.

                    GREG
          We thought this would be so easy.
          It’s like every decision we made
          this week made everything worse. We
          embarrassed her, violated her
          trust. We basically drove her to do
          this.

Greg braces himself for a lecture from June.

                    JUNE
          She came to us about Coachella last
          week. And we shut it down too hard.
          So this isn’t all on you.

Greg and Nicole are surprised to be let off the hook.

                    NICOLE
          Teenagers. Right?

They sit in silent agreement, some of the tension released.


INT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - VIP TENT - LATER

Jasmine leads Amy and her friends inside. She spots her
father RAUL, hobnobbing with VIPs. She runs up and hugs him.

                     JASMINE
          Daddy!!!

                     RAUL
          Ohhh, uh, hey doll. Hey girls.
          Having fun? Hey, I’m just in the
          middle of something. You wanna meet
          Jake Paul?

                     GIRLS
          YES!!

                    RAUL
          Awesome! He’s right over there.
              (to Jasmine)
          I’ll see you tonight. I have to go
          check on Calvin.

                    JASMINE
              (whispering to girls)
          He means “Harris”.
                                                       107.


The girls SQUEAL with delight. They excitedly walk over to
JAKE PAUL, who standing over by a table full of SHOTS.

                    JAKE PAUL
          Hey girls, wanna do some shots?

                    GIRLS
          OKAY!!!

Amy tries to hide her nervousness. This is all a little much.

                    AMY
          Yeah! Cool.


EXT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - LATER

Greg hands out WRISTBANDS to the group. He turns to Nicole.

                    GREG
          Maybe the fact that the ticket
          prices were the exact amount as our
          credit card limit means it was
          meant to be?

The families enter the Festival, scanning the SEA OF FESTIVAL
GOERS.

                    RANDALL
          AMY!!!!

THREE RANDOM GIRLS in the vicinity turn and reply “Yeah?”.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          Okay. We need a better plan than
          that. Where do we start?

                    JUNE
          Amy said Jasmine’s stupid father
          would get them VIP access. Let’s
          start there.

                    GREG
          Shit, that’s on the complete
          opposite side of the grounds.

Andrew and Aaron already look tired and hot.

                     NICOLE
          These boys are looking tired. They
          need fuel.
                                                        108.


EXT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - COTTON CANDY STAND - LATER

Nicole hands the boys COTTON CANDY. They’re thrilled.

                    NICOLE
          You guys need to eat these as fast
          as you can. Eat!

The boys bury their faces in cotton candy and start the long
trek across the grounds. Marty lags behind, distracted by
beautiful girls everywhere he turns.


INT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - VIP TENT - VARIOUS

RAPID FIRE SEQUENCE OF THE GIRLS DOING SHOTS AND DANCING WITH
JAKE PAUL, which abruptly ends with:

                    JAKE PAUL
          Wait- how old are you girls?

                    AMY
          13.

                    JASMINE
          13 and a half.

                    JAKE PAUL
          Wow. All of us almost made a HUGE
          mistake.

Jake Paul abruptly scurries off.

                    JASMINE
          Whatever, let’s do more shots.

Jasmine hands out more shots. Amy looks at hers, starts to
feel a little woozy.

                    AMY
          I don’t really...
              (off Jasmine’s look)
          ...want... this party to stop!

She gags the shot down. Then Jasmine grabs her hand and they
run out of the tent.

                    JASMINE
          Let’s go find some glow in the dark
          shit!

As they run towards the EDM TENT, Amy looks overwhelmed by
all the COACHELLA WEIRDOS.
                                                       109.


INT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - EDM TENT - MOMENTS LATER

Jasmine and Friends are dancing in the middle of a raucous
crowd. It’s insane. Amy is swaying uncomfortably, trying to
fit in, but she keeps getting bumped around by much larger,
sweatier people. She gets knocked back so hard that she’s
SEPARATED FROM HER FRIENDS.

                    AMY
          Jasmine! Christie! Gwen!

Overwhelmed, Amy takes out her phone and sees MISSED CALLS
from Nicole and her Mom and Dad. She tries to call June but
gets bumped again, KNOCKING THE PHONE OUT OF HER HANDS.


I/E. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - VIP AREA - LATER

The VIP tent is guarded by TWO SECURITY GUARDS. The families
peer inside and see Jasmine’s Father, RAUL in the back.

                    JUNE
          There’s Jasmine’s dad!

Randall and June approach the Security Guards.

                    RANDALL
          Hey guys. This is sort of an
          emergency. A 13-year-old girl is
          missing and we need to question
          that man.

                      SECURITY GUARD
          VIP only.

                    JUNE
          Right. But here’s the thing-

                    SECURITY GUARD
          Are you VIP?

                    RANDALL
          Not technically, but-

                    SECURITY GUARD
          Do you know what a choke-slam is?

Randall nods, understanding. They walk back to the family.

                    JUNE
          The security guards are mean. We’re
          not getting in without wristbands.
                                                       110.


Andrew and Aaron can barely stand still, full of sugar and
vibrating like two little crackheads.

                    GREG
          Here’s our wristbands.
              (gets to Boy’s level)
          Boys, you know how me and mom are
          always telling you to stop running
          around and acting wild?

                    ANDREW
          Yeah.

                    GREG
          Well today... is Opposite Day.

The boys cheer!

                    AARON
          I hate you Dad.

Greg is momentarily horrified, then decodes the message. He
pulls them in for hugs.

                    GREG
          I hate you too. With all my heart.
          Now GO!

Greg sends the boys running.


I/E. VIP TENT - MOMENTS LATER

The boys run into the VIP area right past the Security
Guards, who leave their post to chase after them. June and
Randall use this distraction to sneak into the VIP area. They
make a beeline for Raul, tap him on the shoulder.

                    JUNE
          You’re Jasmine’s father.

                    RAUL
          I’m sorry, do I know you?

                    JUNE
          No, because you haven’t been to a
          single school function or even been
          at your own house since I’ve known
          your daughter.

                    RANDALL
          We’re Amy’s parents. Do you know
          where she is?
                                                        111.


                    RAUL
          Listening to music somewhere? It’s
          a music festival. Lighten up.

                    JUNE
          We can’t lighten up! Because of
          parents like you, who make
          responsible parents like us, look
          like we’re the bad guys. You’re the
          bad guy, guy.

                    RAUL
          Not to my daughter, I’m not. Or
          your daughter for that matter. I’m
          giving them a VIP experience at
          Coachella. I’m a goddamn hero.

June and Randall are stewing. Raul smirks at Randall.

                    RAUL (CONT’D)
          What are you gonna do? You gonna
          hit me? In front of Scooter Braun?

                    RANDALL
          No.

Randall SNEEZES into Raul’s mouth. Raul recoils.

                    RAUL
          AH WHAT THE HELL?!

                    JUNE
          You know what? I’ll hit you in
          front of Scooter Braun.

June PUNCHES Raul in the face right in front of a scandalized
SCOOTER BRAUN.


EXT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - JAIL - LATER

June, Randall, Greg, Nicole, Marty, Andrew and Aaron are
tossed in music festival jail, which is really just a tent
with some folding chairs and ONE RENT-A-COP.

                    RANDALL
          I hope Amy’s okay.

                    JUNE
          You know what? She hasn’t even
          tried to contact us. Maybe
          Jasmine’s father’s right and she’s
          just having a good time and doesn’t
          need us.
                                                        112.


A solemn beat. Then, they’re distracted by another CELLMATE
berating a SECURITY GUARD:

                    GIRL (O.S.)
              (drunkenly slurring)
          Do you even know who my dad is?!

                    NICOLE
          Ugh, the people at this music
          festival are so obnoxious.
              (noticing)
          Wait, that’s Jasmine.

They turn to see Jasmine, who has VOMIT all down her shirt.

                    JUNE
          Ugh. Did you puke glitter?

                    JASMINE
              (sobbing)
          A little. My outfit’s ruined.

Gwen and Christie are also there, clearly wasted.

                    JUNE
          Jasmine, where is Amy?

                    JASMINE
          She’s right here-
              (realizing)
          - oh, wait. She’s not. Weird.

Jasmine burps and then slinks to the ground to sleep.

                    JUNE
          Wait, don’t pass out yet! Where did
          you last see her?

Jasmine manages a WEAK EDM CLUB BEAT and closes her eyes.

                    RANDALL
          What the hell was that?

                    MARTY
          Was that an “oonts”? Were you doing
          a house beat?

Jasmine weakly holds a thumbs up.

                    MARTY (CONT’D)
          Is she in the EDM tent?

No response.
                                                        113.


                    MARTY (CONT’D)
          Roll your tongue out of your mouth
          if the answer’s “yes”.

A tense beat as they all stare at Jasmine’s face. Then, her
tongue lazily rolls out the side of her mouth. Hope springs!

                    RANDALL
          EDM tent! We have to get out of
          here!

                    GREG
          We can’t. We’re stuck in music
          festival jail.

They look around the tent, noticing that everyone else in
jail is either heavily intoxicated or having a bad drug trip.
The STAFF is paying a lot more attention to those people.

                    JUNE
          Are we?


EXT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - JAIL - MOMENTS LATER

The Families simply walk out of the tent. June spots the EDM
tent across the grounds.

                    JUNE
          I’m thinking the EDM tent probably
          isn’t the best place for the kids.

                    GREG
          We’ll watch them. You guys go.

June and Randall run to the EDM TENT.


INT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - EDM TENT - SOON AFTER

June and Randall are instantly overwhelmed. The music is
extremely loud and it’s nearly pitch black, except for some
seizure-inducing laser lights.

They inch their way through the packed crowd. It’s near
impossible to make out faces without getting uncomfortably
close to people. They try futilely yelling for Amy but the
music is way too loud.

                    RANDALL
          I CAN’T SEE ANYTHING!

                    JUNE
          HUH?!
                                                         114.


                    RANDALL
          DO YOU SEE HER ANYWHERE?!

                    JUNE
          I CAN’T HEAR ANYTHING!

Randall gets an idea. He takes out his phone and pulls up a
PICTURE OF AMY. He shows it to NEARBY RAVERS.

                    RANDALL
          HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL?!

FROM RAVER’S POV: the phone is leaving trippy light trails.
The Ravers are mesmerized, following the phone’s movement
with their eyes and heads as they dance along with it.

Suddenly, the music gets a LITTLE QUIETER.

                    JUNE
          Oh thank god. At least we can hear
          each other now.

                    RANDALL
          No... I think this is just the slow
          build. We only have fifteen seconds
          before this place goes insane!

                    JUNE
          There’s too many dancing idiots!
          We’re never gonna find her!

THE MUSIC STEADILY BUILDS. June scans the crowd, then sees a
GIANT LEVER beside the stage.

                    JUNE (CONT’D)
          There! Come on!

June and Randall fight their way to the stage as the MUSIC
BUILDS, nearing its crescendo. THE CROWD IS READY TO EXPLODE.

                    RANDALL
          Outta my way, you goddamn
          millennials!

THE SECOND BEFORE THE BEAT DROPS, June reaches the Lever and
flips it up. THE BRIGHT HOUSE LIGHTS TURN ON AND THE ENTIRE
CROWD SHIELDS THEIR EYES, BLINDED.

The DJ stops the music. Everyone in the crowd stumbles
around, disoriented and agitated.

June and Randall scan the crowd and find Amy balled up in the
corner of the tent, alone and scared.
                                                        115.


She spots her parents and a flood of relief washes over her.
Amy rushes over, latching onto them tight, crying.

                    AMY
          I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have come
          here.

                    JUNE
          It’s okay. It’s okay.

                    AMY
          I don’t know what I was thinking. I
          just wanna go home.

Randall and June share a poignant look. She still needs them
after all.


EXT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - EDM TENT - SOON AFTER

Randall, June and Amy reunite with the rest of the family.
Nicole and Greg hug Amy, relieved that she’s safe. Marty goes
in for a hug, but is met with a punch to the shoulder.

                    MARTY
          Guess I deserved that.

                    JUNE
          Amy, come on. Be nice to him.

                    GREG
          Really? You’re gonna give her a
          hard time for that? After what you
          put me through growing up?

                    JUNE
          What I put you through?

                    GREG
          Uhhh, yeah. Like, my seventh
          birthday? When you locked me in my
          toy chest for hours. I still have
          nightmares about it.

                    JUNE
          Yeah? So do I.

OFF Greg’S CONFUSION--


INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

We FLASHBACK to the first scene of the movie, only this time
it’s shown from JUNE’S POV.
                                                        116.


                    JUNE
          Okay. When I close this, you need
          to count to five but most
          importantly, you need to believe.

Greg nods and June closes the toy chest. She then rushes to
the door and pokes her head out to the hallway. Her MOTHER is
pacing on the phone, YELLING and THROWING things at the wall.

                     MOTHER
          GOOD! CUZ I HATE YOU TOO! YOU
          SELFISH PIECE OF SHIT!
              (beat)
          OH! YOU DON’T WANT TO BE HERE?!
          NEITHER DO I! YOU’RE FORCING ME TO
          RAISE THEM BY MYSELF!

Scared, June shuts the door, unsure what to do.

                    GREG (O.S.)
          Nothing’s happening! I’m just
          getting hot.

                    JUNE
          Weird! Maybe try to believe more!

She hears more SCREAMING and GLASS SHATTERING from the other
room and turns on the stereo and turns it to full blast to
drown out the sound. She sits down on the toy chest and
starts to cry.

                    GREG (O.S.)
          JUNE! LET ME OUT! JUNE!


EXT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - EDM TENT - CONTINUOUS

BACK TO JUNE.

                    JUNE
          And it wasn’t hours, it was more
          like 20 minutes... or however long
          it took for mom to run out of
          breath.

Greg struggles to process this new information.

                     GREG
          ... what about the time you made me
          stay in the dog house all
          afternoon?
                                                       117.


                    JUNE
          Right. Dog Day Afternoon. Mom
          accused Dad of cheating when he was
          in Hong Kong. That was a bad one.

                    GREG
          Well that doesn’t explain why you
          made me eat all those dog treats.

                    JUNE
          I didn’t. You did that on your own,
          I assume because you like the taste
          of dog treats.

                    GREG
          ... shit...

                    JUNE
          Pretty dumb that we’re competing
          over who’s the better parent when
          both of us are way better than mom
          and dad ever were.

                     GREG
          Seriously.
              (then)
          You really think I’m a good parent?

                    JUNE
          Of course I do.

Greg hugs June almost he has no control of it. Her approval
clearly means a lot to him.

                    JUNE (CONT’D)
          Should we try to find you some more
          dog treats? There’s probably a
          kiosk here somewhere.

Randall then catches Marty staring at a GROUP OF ATTRACTIVE
HIPPIE GIRLS, dancing.

                    RANDALL
           The boy’s growing up.

Then Randall sees what Marty is actually staring at: beyond
the girls is a KIOSK devoted to ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHES.

                    RANDALL (CONT’D)
          You wanna go take a look?

                    MARTY
          Really?
                                                       118.


                    RANDALL
          Yeah, you obviously discovered some
          new things this week that you care
          about.

                    JUNE
          Maybe you’re not too young to learn
          that the world isn’t perfect.

Marty smiles, as Randall and June escort him to the kiosk.

We stay with Greg and Nicole.

                    GREG
          So... you wanna head out soon?

                    NICOLE
          Considering we spent all our money
          on this festival, I feel like we
          should get our money’s worth.


EXT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - VARIOUS - LATER

OVER A DA BABY TRACK, WE SEE:

- Amy and Marty bring June and Randall to the main stage
where Da Baby is performing.

                    JUNE
          Yeesh. Someone needs to wash Da
          Baby’s mouth out with soap.

- Greg and Nicole dance with Andrew and Aaron, swinging them
in the air, having fun.

- Randall, June, Greg and Nicole all lie on their stomachs
getting HENNA TATTOO TRAMP STAMPS as their kids look on.

- The families walk toward the exit gates at sunset. The
parents all wear Coachella crop tops, exposing the small of
their backs where the words “COACHELLA” are written in Henna.

DING DING DING! The sound of a BELL ringing.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

REVEAL Andrew and Aaron in INFLATABLE SUMO SUITS. Greg and
Nicole (DRESSED IN WORK CLOTHES) cheer as the boys collide,
harmlessly bouncing off each other. Nicole checks her phone.
                                                       119.


                     NICOLE
          Alright, I should head out. I have
          a showing.

Aaron jumps on Andrew, pinning him.

                    NICOLE (CONT’D)
          Whoa! Look at Aaron!

                    GREG
          I paid Andrew to go down in the
          third round.
              (proudly)
          And he actually listened.

They kiss. This dynamic seems a lot healthier.


INT. PANCAKE PALACE - DAY

We follow a PACK OF SINGING WAITERS with short-stack pancake
hats carrying a BIRTHDAY CAKE. They place it in front of AMY,
who now has a NOSE RING, which looks slightly infected. She’s
sitting at a table with June, Randall and Marty. She blows
out the candles and everyone claps.

                    JUNE
          Your nose is looking a lot less red
          today.

                    AMY
          Why’d you let me get this thing?

                    RANDALL
          Because you’re old enough to make
          your own decisions. And live with
          the painful consequences.

Beside them, a YOUNG KID in the next booth starts having a
tantrum and has to be carried out of the restaurant, surf-
board style. Randall and June smile, happy to not be dealing
with that bullshit anymore. Life is good.


INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Greg, Nicole and the boys lie in bed together, cuddling and
finishing a proper Avengers book together.

                    ANDREW
          Can we have one more story?

Greg and Nicole look at each other, happy to be back in the
routine. They open another book.
                                                          120.


The boys rest their heads on their parents’ shoulders, while
Greg and Nicole enthusiastically read to them.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

It’s HALLOWEEN! Packs of kids trick-or-treating in costume.
Among them, we see Andrew and Aaron dressed as THOR and
CAPTAIN AMERICA. Marty is dressed as AL GORE, holding a GREEN
BAG. Amy is understandably absent and with her friends.

The kids get their candy and run back to June, Randall, Greg
and Nicole - who we reveal are all dressed like HARVEY
WEINSTEIN (large pillows in their belly, gross stubble on
their faces, all pushing walkers).

                    JUNE
          I don’t see why we all agreed to do
          this. We already did the henna
          thing.

                    NICOLE
          This was your idea!

                    RANDALL
          Yeah, I’m getting a lot of bad
          looks in this costume.

                    GREG
          Whatever. It’s not like we’re
          celebrating the guy.

                    JUNE
          Then why are you carrying around
          two Academy Awards?

                    GREG
          For context. Plus I had them left
          over from the year I dressed as
          Roberto Benigni. Remember when I
          jumped on those tables and hurt my
          hip?

Some parents walk by and give them all disgusted looks.

                    RANDALL
          Sorry. We all lost a Kid Swap.

As they slink away as a family, we pull back to reveal we're
in one of those crane shots that ends movies.
