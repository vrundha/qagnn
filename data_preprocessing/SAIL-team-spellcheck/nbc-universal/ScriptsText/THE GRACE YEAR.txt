FADE IN ON:


EXT. AERIAL - ESTABLISHING

A bird's eye view: A VILLAGE set in a clearing in the middle
of impenetrable forest that stretches as far as we can see.

We move closer, gaining details-- the surrounding patchwork
of farmland. The high wooden fence, stark and foreboding.

And into the town itself. Spare, spartan. Rows of simple
houses leading into a central marketplace and the innermost
hub-- the church. Like the nucleus of a cell.

A tiny microcosm of civilization forged through sheer force
of will out of unforgiving, untamed wilderness.

In this world, heat and light come from fire. Water comes
from a well. Food comes from the ground and the forest. And
survival is a gift from God.


EXT. TOWN - SUNRISE

We float, disembodied, through the empty town toward the
church. It looms over us, ominous and imposing. A
puritanical, frontier vibe.

We come to a stop in front of the church, at the town's
centerpiece:

A giant leafless TREE made out of twisted metal. Where a
WOMAN stands on a platform with a noose around her neck.

She stands silent and still in a heavy shroud. Her head
bowed. Neck bent unnaturally. Long hair hanging down,
obscuring her face.

We move closer... closer...

And now we see-- BLOOD dripping from the Woman's hands.
Dropping into puddles on the ground on either side of her.


INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

TIERNEY JAMES (16) jolts awake, gasping for breath. Her
night dress damp with sweat. Her plaited hair in disarray.

                         PENNY
              Tierney?
                                                             3.


Tierney looks across the homespun quilt to her two younger
sisters sharing the bed-- CLARA (14) and PENNY (12)-- both
in identical night dresses and white-ribboned braids,
sharing the same look of concern.

                         CLARA
             Are you alright? Was it...
                   (low, scandalous)
             A dream?

                         PENNY
             Maybe your magic is coming in!

Tierney tenses. Shivers. Magic... But she shakes it off.

                         TIERNEY
             It was nothing. I'm fine.

She slides out of bed, feet on the bare wooden floor. Pulls
on her dress, starts to do up the buttons-- but her sisters
are staring. Did she miss a button?

                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
             ...What?

Penny and Clara giggle.

                         PENNY
             Did you forget?

                         CLARA
             Because Aunt Linny didn't.

(O.S.) A door SLAMS. A sharp VOICE echos in.

                         AUNT LINNY (O.S.)
             Oh Giiiiiiirrrrrrls!


INT. SEWING ROOM - DAY

CORSET STRINGS tighten against Tierney's back as Clara YANKS
them with all her might. Tierney sucks in her breath,
holding onto the sewing table for support.

                          TIERNEY
             Ow...

Penny SCRUBS Tierney's calloused feet. We see the scar of a
BRAND on the sole of one foot: three slashes in a rectangle.

                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
             Careful--
                                                             4.


AUNT LINNY (severe and ruthless) DIGS the dirt out from
under Tierney's fingernails with a file.

                            TIERNEY (cont'd)
                Hey!

                            AUNT LINNY
                It's your own fault. Running wild
                like a dog...

Aunt Linny picks up a deep-blue raw-silk dress with river-
clam pearls along the neckline.

                            AUNT LINNY (cont'd)
                Come on. Arms up.

Tierney looks at the dress the way a convict eyes a noose.
But she obediently raises her arms overhead...


MOMENTS LATER

Aunt Linny surveys her handiwork. She just looks resigned, as
if this is the latest in a long series of disappointments.

                            AUNT LINNY
                It will have to do. One last thing.

She goes to the sewing box for A LONG, RED RIBBON.

Vibrant. Daring. Almost vulgar compared to the girls' muted
and modest clothing. A color of danger and sin and blood.

Aunt Linny gently undoes the white ribbon from Tierney's
braid and lets it fall to the floor. She takes her time
tying the red ribbon in its place. A rite of passage.

And as she works, we may notice-- half of her thumb is
missing. An old, ugly wound.

                            AUNT LINNY (cont'd)
                Today, my dear, you leave childhood
                behind. Today you become a woman.

Penny leans in to Clara.

                            PENNY
                She looks like a stuffed turkey.

Tierney studies herself in a full-length mirror. Pink
cheeks, freshly scrubbed. Dark hair, perfectly coiffed. Pale
skin, offset by the deep blue of the dress. Heaving chest,
constricted by the corset.
                                                             5.


A reflection she doesn't recognize. She frowns, not sure
what to make of this stranger in the mirror.

                         ABE (O.S.)
             My little Tierney. Look at you.

The girls straighten up as-- their FATHER (ABE) walks in. He
has a kind face, a strong frame, and a twinkle in his eye.
He carries a heavy medical bag and a weary expression.

Aunt Linny stands to the side. Eyes downcast, deferential.
Penny and Clara sit with their legs tucked under them and
their hands in their laps, prim and obedient.

                         AUNT LINNY
             I did my best. Even if a veil is out
             of the question...
                   (sighs)
             She'll at least look the part.

                         TIERNEY
             I don't need a veil. There's nothing
             wrong with the labor houses.

                         AUNT LINNY
             Working your fingers to the bone,
             struggling for scraps, sharing a room
             with ten other girls...

                         TIERNEY
                   (sharp)
             Better than being someone's wife.

It's like the air goes out of the room. Everyone freezes.
Aunt Linny looks like she's been slapped.

                         AUNT LINNY
             How dare you show such disrespect--?

But Abe waves it off. He gives Tierney a wink.

                         ABE
             Tierney's right. There is no shame in
             hard work. The dairy and the mill are
             both entirely respectable. And she's
             always been a free spirit.

Aunt Linny just huffs.

                         AUNT LINNY
             And you've indulged her. Far be it
             for me to tell you how to raise your
             daughters, Abe, but--
                                                             6.


                         TIERNEY
             Can I go now?

                           ABE / AUNT LINNY
             Yes. / No.

Tierney can't leave fast enough. But as she reaches the door:

                         ABE
             And while you're out, pick up some
             berries from the market.

Tierney stops short. Penny and Clara giggle.

                         TIERNEY
             Like this?! But-- it's Veiling Day!
             Everyone will be there!

Abe holds Tierney's gaze. Aunt Linny gives a slight smirk,
as if she's won some battle.

                         ABE
             That's the point. And Tierney, today
             of all days-- mind your dress.


ON TIERNEY

Storming out of the sewing room as Aunt Linny's voice echoes:

                         AUNT LINNY (O.S.)
             Alright, girls-- morning scriptures.

Striding through the modest house-- past stockings drying on
the mantle... a basket full of unfinished knitting... herbs
hanging in the windowsill...

She grabs a cloak and bursts out the front door--


EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

--toward the market and the looming steeple of the church.

She passes women hanging laundry... Men loading a wagon...
Little boys playing with sticks... Little girls cuddling
corncob dolls. She feels all their eyes on her--

Her exposed chest and collarbone. Her bare calves and knees.
The bright red ribbon in her hair.

Tierney wraps the cloak around her, hiding her body. She
quickens her pace, hurrying toward the crowded--
                                                          7.


EXT. MARKET - CONTINUOUS

The heart of the town: a maze of open air stalls, and a
cacophony of people. Bartering and gossiping. Hurrying
through a list of chores.

And now we notice-- so many women in this town are
DISFIGURED in different ways. A faded scar... A hobbled
walk... A patch over one eye... A missing ear...

They all walk with stooped shoulders, bowed heads, eyes
downcast. And they're all modestly dressed in muted colors,
their hair braided back. With a few exceptions:

We spot other red ribbons in the crowd. Teenage girls freshly
primped in fancy dresses, escorted about like show cattle.
The flashes of skin, vibrant colors, and adornments feel
daring and extravagant, and even lewd.

Tierney is so busy people watching that she forgets her own
discomfort and lets her cloak fall open as she goes to the
fruit stall to fetch a basket of berries.

                         BEHIND HER
             My, my, Tierney.

Tierney turns to see KIERSTEN (16), a porcelain beauty in a
silk dress with strands of gold woven in her hair. Her full
lips are as red as her ribbon. Her eyes are cold and cruel.

She stands with two other girls, JENNA and JESSICA, planets
orbiting the sun.

                         KIERSTEN
             So you do have a figure under there.
             Who ever would have guessed? Pity it
             will only go to waste.

Jessica and Jenna giggle. Tierney can feel her cheeks flush.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             If you see Michael, say hello for me.

And with that, Kiersten and her sycophants move on. Tierney
trades a few coins for a basket of berries as the FRUIT
VENDOR grins at her chest. He was clearly eavesdropping.

                         FRUIT VENDOR
             I'd give you a veil and then some.

Tierney just grits her teeth. She starts to turn away when--
                                                             8.


A DOG growls at her feet. Scrawny and dirty and heavily
muzzled. An animal that's had meanness beaten into it. And
the Young Man holding the leash is TOMMY PEARSON.

                             TOMMY
               Nice dress.

Tommy reaches out and runs a finger over the the tiny pearls
near Tierney's collarbone. Enjoying her rage when she SMACKS
his hand away.

                           TIERNEY
               Touch me again, you'll lose a finger.

                           TOMMY
               Such a temper for a lady. Someone
               needs to teach you the manners your
               father never could.

Tierney goes to smack him again, but people are watching. So
she reigns in her temper, smooths her dress, glares.

He leans in. Invading her space. Close enough to whisper:

                           TOMMY (cont'd)
               I've got a new muzzle that needs
               breaking in and a veil to match. And
               I don't care who your mother was.

That's enough. Tierney's eyes flash. She pushes past him--

The crowded market no longer feels like a place she can
hide. Everyone seems to be looking at her. Women frowning.
Children whispering. Old men leering. Young boys laughing.

She hurries away... through narrow alleys and back
streets... until she reaches


AN OLD MILL.

Abandoned and falling apart. Singed and charred from some
long-ago fire. Nothing but farmers' fields beyond it and--
in the distance-- the high wooden FENCE that separates the
town from the surrounding forest.

Tierney looks around to make sure no one is watching...


INT. MILL - MOMENTS LATER

Tierney slips inside--
                                                             9.


All shadows and cobwebs and broken bits of machinery. The
floorboards groan and creak beneath her feet. And suddenly--

A FIGURE grabs her from behind! Tierney WHIRLS around--

                         TIERNEY
                   (furious)
             Michael!

MICHAEL-- 16, grins at her, teasing. But when he takes in
the full sight of her, all dressed up, his eyes go wide.

                         MICHAEL
             Wow. You look--

                         TIERNEY
             Don't. Start.

Tierney sets down her berries and makes her way to a rotting
ladder. She climbs up to a--


LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

A musty, cramped space made cozy with rugs and cushions and
candles and a bolt of tattered cloth covering the broken
window. A secret hideaway.

Michael pulls aside a rug to reveal-- a crude checkerboard
pattern carved into the floor.

Tierney pulls up a loose floorboard to retrieve a small box
with little trinkets inside: a thimble, a spool, a button,
a bullet etc.

They position the trinkets on the board and we realize--
they're GAME PIECES.

Michael moves his first piece on the board. Tierney moves
next. Soon they're both deep in concentration...

Or are they? Michael keeps stealing glances at her.

                         TIERNEY
             Stop it.

                         MICHAEL
             What?

                         TIERNEY
             You're looking at me.
                                                            10.


                         MICHAEL
             You're... hard not to look at. Like
             that.

                          TIERNEY
             You should see some of the other
             girls.
                    (smirks)
             Kiersten sends her regards. She says
             she looks forward to bringing you
             many sons.

                          MICHAEL
             Not funny.

                         TIERNEY
             I'm sure your Fathers already have
             names picked out.

Tierney moves a piece, removing one of Michael's. Michael
studies the board, his expression inscrutable.

                          MICHAEL
             And what about you? What does your
             future hold?

                         TIERNEY
             Actually, that might depend on you.

Michael pauses. He was about to make a move, but now his
hand freezes on a game piece...

                         MICHAEL
             What do you mean?

                         TIERNEY
             I was thinking, if I make it back
             from the Grace Year--

                         MICHAEL
             When you make it back.

                         TIERNEY
             --I want to tend the fields. And I
             was hoping you could ask your Father
             to pull some strings for me.

Michael's paralysis breaks. He captures one of Tierney's
pieces and swats it aside, surprisingly hostile.

                         MICHAEL
             The fields? That's the lowest work
             available.
                         (MORE)
                                                         11.

                          MICHAEL (cont'd)
             You'd be alone, open to the elements,
             with no protection. And so close to
             the forest--

                         TIERNEY
             I can take care of myself.

                         MICHAEL
             Against a ghost?!
                   (before she can reply)
             The point is-- You deserve a real
             home. A real life.

                         TIERNEY
             Where my every thought and action can
             be dictated by my husband's whims?

                         MICHAEL
             Maybe, with the right husband--

But Tierney shoots him a look.

                         TIERNEY
             No man in his right mind will ever
             take me for a wife. I am stained with
             my mother's sins. And even if I
             wasn't... You know how I feel.

Michael sits quietly. Thinking. He knows.

                         MICHAEL
             Is this because of... you know. Your
             dreams?

Tierney tenses. This is dangerous territory.

                         MICHAEL (cont'd)
             Have you had any more?

Tierney makes another move on the game board. Evasive.

                          TIERNEY
             I told you, I'm done with all that. I
             just...
                   (from her soul)
             I want to be able to stare up at the
             sky anytime I want. And feel the sun
             on my back. And dig my fingers into
             the earth. And help things grow. I
             want to feel useful and untethered
             and... Free.

Michael doesn't respond. He reaches for a piece--
                                                            12.


But Tierney grabs his hand. Commanding his attention.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             Please. Say you'll do this for me.

Michael looks at her. Serious, sincere.

                         MICHAEL
             I would do anything for you...

He wants to say more, but-- the CHURCH BELL begins to clang.
Michael and Tierney trade a look. Their time is up.


ON TIERNEY AND MICHAEL

Walking back to the center of town. Tierney clutching the
basket of berries in her arms.

                         MICHAEL
             I can't believe I'm not going to see
             you for an entire year...

                         TIERNEY
             You'll be so busy you won't even
             notice. What with training for the
             Council, and preparing your new home
             for your future bride...

Michael looks around, ensuring they're alone.

                         MICHAEL
             What do you think it'll be like?

                         TIERNEY
             Hmm. I'm imagining lots of lace. And
             Kiersten seems partial to blue...

                         MICHAEL
             No-- you know... The Grace Year.

                         TIERNEY
                   (feigning horror)
             Michael Welk! You know we don't speak
             of such things!

                         MICHAEL
             Come on. How long do you think it
             takes for your magic to come in?

Tierney tenses. He's struck a nerve.
                                                            13.


                         TIERNEY
             We really should not be talking about
             this.

                         MICHAEL
             Do you think it will happen to all
             the girls at once? Like with your...

She shoves him, but it's half-hearted. Her mind is suddenly
elsewhere...

                         MICHAEL (cont'd)
             I wonder how it will manifest. I
             overheard my mother and her sister
             once. Something about reading minds...

Tierney's gaze is up ahead. Sound falls away as she fixates
on the monstrosity in the center of town square:

THE PUNISHMENT TREE.

The very tree we saw the Woman hanging from in our opening.

Its twisted metal branches adorned with BODY PARTS. Fingers.
Toes. Ears. Braids of hair. Hanging like ornaments.

Tierney stares at it-- transfixed. Remembering her dream.

                           MICHAEL (cont'd)
             Tierney...?

Tierney snaps out of it. She looks down to see--

Her hands are stained bright red. Just like the Woman in her
dream.

It takes her a moment to realize-- it's the berries. She was
squeezing them. And now her dress is stained as well.

Up ahead, women and girls are filing into the church. And
here comes Aunt Linny, looking frantic.

                         AUNT LINNY
             There you are! What were you-- Your
             dress!

Michael gives Tierney's hand a squeeze.

                         MICHAEL
             Hey. Whatever happens... It's going
             to be okay. I promise.

And now Aunt Linny is dragging her toward the church.
                                                         14.


INT. CHURCH - DAY

All the women and girls of the town mill about the church.
Knitting. Laughing. Gossiping. Complimenting dresses and
admiring babies and comparing the length of their braids.

Tierney stands among them, but apart. Alone in a crowd. When
people look at her it's with pity or judgment, never a smile.

She watches Kiersten, Jenna, and Jessica approach an awkward
girl keeping to herself near the back wall. GERTRUDE.

Kiersten toys with Gertrude's sleeve.

                          KIERSTEN
             Such fine detail with the lace. And
             the gloves are a nice touch, aren't
             they, girls?

Right on cue, Jessica and Jenna move in. Mocking her.

                         JESSICA
             As if everyone's forgotten what
             they're covering.

                         JENNA
             Poor thing thinks she actually has a
             chance. But who would want to marry
             Dirty Gertie?

Gertrude flushes. Cornered. Desperate to escape...

Tierney looks away. Not her problem. And then--

A middle-aged woman comes rushing down from the bell tower.

                         WOMAN
             The veils are coming!

The women and girls rush to take their seats in the
congregation. Tierney and the other red-ribboned girls form
a line in the front of the church.

A woman in the front pew stands, reading from a Bible as--

                         BIBLE READER
             "An excellent wife, who can find? For
             her worth is far above jewels..."

The doors OPEN...
                                                            15.


And KIERSTEN'S FATHER steps inside with a delicate veil in
his hands. He walks up the aisle and places the veil on
Kiersten's head like he is crowning a queen.

Kiersten smiles angelically. The first veil. An honor.

                         BIBLE READER (cont'd)
             "Her husband trusts his heart in her."

Other Fathers file in.

                         BIBLE READER (cont'd)
             "And he will have no lack of gain."

Jessica gets a veil... And Jenna...

                         BIBLE READER (cont'd)
             "She does him good and not evil all
             the days of her life..."

Tierney TUNES OUT the bible reader, watching the other
girls. They light up with joy and relief as their fathers
approach. Some cry. Some squeal. One girl almost faints.

Eight veils given... Nine... Only five left to go. The other
girls in line are getting restless. Nervous.

Murmurs of surprise ripple through the crowd as Gertrude's
Father approaches with a veil. Gertrude looks STUNNED as he
places it on her head. And some of the girls near her look
like they'd like to rip it off.

Tierney's eyes wander over the other girls. Faces twisted in
anger and jealousy. Tears streaming, dreams dashed, hearts
broken. But she's so busy watching that she doesn't see--

                          ABE
             Tierney...

Tierney looks. She blinks. There must be some mistake...

Her Father is standing before her holding a veil.

Before she can react, he places the veil on her head,
lowering the lace over her face...

Like she's looking through the bars of a cage.

                         ABE (PRE-LAP)
             I know this isn't what you planned--
                                                            16.


INT. TIERNEY'S HOME - NIGHT

Tierney confronts her Father in the privacy of their home,
where she can actually speak her mind.

But Tierney is seeing red. Wild with fury. Pacing the floor.

                         TIERNEY
             Who is it? Tommy Pearson? He's cruel
             and stupid and arrogant! Did you even
             try to stand up for me? Did Michael?

Her sisters watch her fury from the stairs. Abe grimaces.

                         ABE
             There were plenty of protests all
             around, believe me. But your suitor's
             mind was set.

And now Tierney stops. She meets her Father's gaze. And it's
not just fury in her eyes-- it's pain. It feels like her
Father betrayed her.

                         TIERNEY
             How could you do this to me?

                         ABE
             I just want what's best for you. You
             have to believe that.

                         TIERNEY
             What about what I want?

Abe reaches out to touch her, to comfort her-- but Tierney
smacks his hand away.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             Don't touch me!

She turns and runs up the stairs--


INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

--SLAMMING the door behind her. She RIPS off the veil and
FLOPS onto the bed. Hating the world. Hating her life.


INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

And Tierney is still awake, with Clara and Penny sleeping
next to her, when she hears HEAVY FOOTSTEPS stop outside her
door. Her Father.
                                                            17.


She can see his shadow under the door crack. Lingering. As
if he wants to come in, but doesn't dare.

Then the heavy footsteps recede. And yet-- the SHADOW
remains. What's this?

Tierney creeps out of bed and opens the door to see--

His MEDICAL BAG. He left it here for her. An invitation.


INT. STUDY - MOMENT LATER

Tierney enters with the medical bag to find her Father
waiting for her.

He gestures for her to sit. She does. But she's still salty.

                         TIERNEY
             I would rather die than be Tommy
             Pearson's wife.

Abe remains stoic.

                         ABE
             Right now that should be the least of
             your worries.

OFF TIERNEY: Still sulking, but she knows he's right.

                         TIERNEY
             What happens? During the Grace Year?

At that, her Father sighs.

                         ABE
             If I knew, I would tell you. I swear
             it. But no man is privy to that
             sacred rite. And your mother never...

But he trails off, unable to continue.

Tierney looks up sharply at the mention of her mother. A
subject they rarely speak of. But since he brought it up...

There's another question weighing on her. One she's never
dared to voice before.

                         TIERNEY
             Was she really harboring her magic?

Abe looks at her quizzically. Studying her. Weighing how to
answer.
                                                          18.


                          ABE
             Your mother was a good woman. No
             matter what people say.
                   (beat)
             And we can discuss it further when
             you're back where you belong.

But Tierney's voice trembles as she reveals her true fear:

                         TIERNEY
             But what if the same thing happens to
             me? What if-- I return from the Grace
             Year... and my magic hasn't run out?

At that, Abe softens.

                         ABE
             You just make sure you return at all.
             Whatever it takes, you hear me?
             Everything I taught you-- use it. And
             we'll sort the rest out together.

Tierney nods. Though she's not exactly reassured.

                         ABE (cont'd)
             Now. The bag.

Tierney opens the medical bag. She reaches in... and removes
a glass vial. She pulls out the cork, gives a small sniff.

                         TIERNEY
             Camphor. Distilled from the bark of
             the tree. Applied topically to
             relieve pain and itching. Inhaled to
             reduce a cough.

Abe grunts his approval. Tierney reaches in for another
item-- a tiny dropper.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             Primrose oil...


INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Tierney blinks awake in bed to see-- Penny, staring at her.

                         PENNY
             If the ghosts get you, will you come
             back and haunt us?

Across the bed, Clara wallops her with a pillow.
                                                            19.


                         CLARA
             The ghosts stay in the forest. Their
             magic binds them to the place where
             they died. Everyone knows that.

                         TIERNEY
             But I will make a point to haunt you
             personally if you touch my things.

Clara rolls her eyes, but Penny looks nervous as--

The bedroom door opens, and in comes Abe, carrying a tray
laden with enough food for the entire family.

He sets the tray on the bed. Penny and Clara eagerly reach--

                         ABE
             This is for Tierney. All of it.

Tierney dutifully begins to eat as she pulls on her clothes.
No finery today-- thick wool stockings, heavy leather boots,
a cotton chemise and linen smock. Traveling clothes.

She slips a biscuit to Penny and Clara as--

Abe presents her with a hand-crafted HEAVY CLOAK.

                         ABE (cont'd)
             And so is this. It was your mother's.
             Warm enough for winter, and you can
             take off the sleeves for a vest come
             spring. Just-- mind the lining.

Tierney pulls it on, ignoring him.

                         ABE (cont'd)
             Tierney.

                         TIERNEY
             Spring. The lining. I heard you.

Tierney hugs the coat tightly around her. Her mother's...
This really means something to her.

Outside, the church bell CLANGS. Tierney freezes. But Abe
picks up her veil.

                         ABE
             Come on, then. It's time.
                                                            20.


EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

The church bell keeps CLANGING as Tierney and the other
thirty-three girls stand in a line. Thirteen in veils. All
with red ribbons in their hair.

Tierney stands between Kiersten and Gertrude.

The rest of the town gathers to watch the ceremony. When the
bell stops, all eyes turn to the church. The doors open...

A DRUM begins to beat. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. And the first of
this year's eligible men exits the church:

GEEZER FALLOW. A stooped old man in mourning attire, though
he doesn't even try to hide his smile as he makes his way to
the square to claim a new bride.

Tierney tenses. Is it just her imagination, or is Geezer
Fallow smiling at her?

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. Geezer Fallow gets closer... Oh god. He's
heading right for her. His smile widens as he stops--

--in front of Gertrude.

Murmurs of surprise ripple through the crowd. Gertrude looks
stunned and horrified as he lifts her veil.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The next boy arrives, nervous and sweaty.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. More boys follow. Lifting veils. Claiming
their brides...

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. Here comes Tommy Pearson. He catches her
eye and smiles cruelly. Heading right for her.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. Tierney looks out into the crowd-- to her
Father. Silently pleading with him: Do something!!

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. Tommy Pearson comes to a stop--

--in front of Kiersten.

Murmurs ripple through the crowd. Kiersten GASPS-- shocked,
confused-- as Tommy lifts her veil.

Tierney frowns. Not understanding what she's seeing...

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. And then a pair of freshly shined boots
stop in front of her. Fingers lift the veil--

And it's Michael standing before her.
                                                           21.


                         TIERNEY
             Michael? What are you doing?

Next to her, Tommy Pearson is pawing all over Kiersten.

                         MICHAEL
             You didn't really think I'd let you
             be assigned to the field house.

                         TIERNEY
                   (reeling)
             What about Kiersten...? What about
             your Father...?

                         MICHAEL
             Father... will come around. But it
             doesn't matter. This is my choice.
                   (he takes her hands)
             You must know. You have to know. I've
             wanted to tell you for so long.
             Tierney-- I love you.

Up ahead, Mr. Welk raises his hands to the crowd. We
recognize him; the man who sentenced Tierney's mother to
die. Everyone quiets, attentive.

                         MR. WELK
             The original sin was Eve's. The
             Serpent preyed upon her vanity, her
             curiosity, her ambition. He tricked
             her, and cursed her with the gift of
             power. A dark magic that seduced Adam
             and brought about the downfall of all
             mankind. A curse that is passed down
             to every member of the female sex as
             they come into their womanhood.

Tierney quietly pleads with Michael...

                         TIERNEY
             Please. You're my best friend. But I
             don't...

                         MR. WELK
             The power to turn a man's head. To
             prey on man's weakness. To inspire
             lust and incite jealousy. To sow
             chaos and discord. To destroy
             families and from within and tear
             entire communities apart.
             Such wickedness is an affront to the
             Lord. And it is coursing through your
             blood. Threatening to destroy us all.
                                                         22.


Tierney is frantic. Desperate. How to get through to him...?

                         TIERNEY
             I will never be the wife you need--

                         MICHAEL
             I don't want a wife. I want you. Just
             as you are. That's all I've ever
             wanted.

He leans in and kisses Tierney's cheek. And whispers:

                          MICHAEL (cont'd)
             You can keep your dreams. But I dream
             only of you.

                         MR. WELK
             But there is hope. With faith, and
             perseverance, and penitence you can
             renounce the magic inside of you. You
             can cast the darkness out and be born
             anew. Righteous, humble, meek and
             mild. Ready to serve the Lord.

Up ahead, the gates LURCH open, revealing the impenetrable
forest beyond. The crowd murmurs with mounting excitement.

                         MR. WELK (cont'd)
             And so, as Eve was banished from the
             Garden, now must we cast you out. Go
             with grace, and know that our hearts
             go with you. Burn through your magic
             and return to us as purified women.
             Or do not return to us at all.

Michael, Tommy Pearson, and the other boys step back. For
just a moment, Tierney locks eyes with Kiersten-- her face
seething with silent hatred. But then--

Guards approach, flanking them, and the girls begin to walk.

Tierney keeps her eyes on her family for as long as she
can... Then she stares up at the high, pointed walls of the
fence... And then she sees--

Last year's Grace Year girls returning.

They stagger past slowly, single-file. Bone weary,
emaciated, reeking with rot and disease. Their eyes glazed
over. Hair matted, haphazardly shorn, red ribbons in
tatters. Some with egregious wounds-- a dislocated shoulder,
a festering wound, missing teeth.
                                                         23.


Up ahead, one of the girls in Tierney's line breaks ranks.

                         GIRL
             Lisbeth? Sister, is that you?

She reaches out, but the returning girl turns her head,
exposing a blood-crusted scab where her ear used to be, and
just keeps walking. Oblivious.

Another girl GRABS Tierney as she staggers past--

                         STAGGERING GIRL
             The ghosts are watching... Don't
             stray from the path--

But the girl behind her shoves her forward.

Family members rush to greet the other returning girls.
Hugging them, examining them, fussing over them. Shouts of
joy, cries of relief. Until--

A frantic mother's voice rises over the commotion:

                         FRANTIC MOTHER
             Ada...? Ada...?! Where is Ada?!

The last of the returning girls passes Tierney, and behind
her-- a Guard marches solemnly with half a dozen RED RIBBONS
draped across his arm. Like the medals of fallen war heroes.

The tenor of the crowd changes. Shouts of anguish, wails of
grief. Tierney shivers. The danger of the forest is suddenly
all too real...

OOF! Kiersten YANKS Tierney's braid from behind, snapping
her head back. She leans in, whispering in Tierney's ear--

                            KIERSTEN
             You're dead.

Then she strides past, making her way to the head of the
line. Jessica and Jenna follow, SHOVING Tierney as they pass.

Tierney rubs her neck. Staring up at the trees whose
branches snake overhead. Wondering what awaits her...


INT. FOREST - DAY

The girls march. Single-file. Guards ahead of them and a
wagon full of supplies behind. Following a narrow, worn path
through the trees.
                                                            24.


The sounds of the forest echo around them. Branches reach
for them like gnarled claws. And every now and then, they
pass signs of violence--

Blood smeared against a tree trunk...

A bird pecking at a severed finger discarded on the path...

A bird pecking at something just off the path. Curious,
Tierney takes a few steps off the path into the brush--

The bird flies off, revealing-- A SEVERED FINGER.

Just then-- BRANCHES SNAP in the brush just ahead. Something
watching her?

Tierney HURRIES back to her place in line.


EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

The girls huddle around a fire as the guards prowl around
them in an uneasy perimeter. Already a hierarchy is forming--

Kiersten, Jenna, and Jessica hold court around the flames.
The other veiled girls sit with them, enjoying the fire,
while the unveiled girls shiver together behind them.

Only one other girl sits apart, isolated and alone. Her veil
only making her more of an outcast: Gertrude.

Tierney perches on a stump, keeping one eye on the forest.
And she's not the only one. They're all on edge, watching
the woods, jumping at shadows.

                         MEG
             How many are there, do you think?

Tierney perks. Listening in. Absorbing as much as she can...

                         MARTHA
             Think of all the girls who never
             return from their Grace Year every
             year. If even a fraction of that was
             the girls consumed by their own
             magic... It would be more than enough
             to overpower us-- if they wanted to.

                         LAURA
             Stop it.
                                                         25.


                         HANNAH
             I bet they're watching us right now.
             Plotting their revenge.

                         RACHEL
             I heard they follow us from the
             moment we leave the gates. Ready to
             strike at any moment.

                           LAURA
                     (about to cry)
             Stop!

Now Kiersten speaks up. Her voice calm and assured.

                         KIERSTEN
             Then you'd better hope your magic
             comes in soon. So you have the power
             to fight them off.

The other girls consider this. Jessica looks around to make
sure the guards aren't listening. Then she leans in,
speaking low, testing the waters.

                         JESSICA
             I know it's a sin, and it's forbidden
             to even talk about, but... I keep
             wondering what my magic will be.

The other girls brighten, an illicit thrill rippling through
them. Many of them are curious, even excited. But they've
had to keep that to themselves-- until now.

A wiry girl, DENA, grins conspiratorially:

                         DENA
             Speaking to animals runs in my family.

Another girl, HELEN, spreads her arms wide.

                         HELEN
             Maybe I'll command the wind.

MEG runs her fingers over the fire.

                         MEG
             Or be impervious to fire.

Another girl, TAMMY, pipes up with a sneer.

                         TAMMY
             We all know Tierney's magic. Stealing
             another girl's husband.
                                                            26.


Everyone goes quiet. It's the elephant in the room. The
unspoken tension that has finally been voiced aloud.

                          TIERNEY
             I didn't--

But Kiersten just laughs. Calm and cool.

                         KIERSTEN
             Please. She didn't steal him from me.
             I wanted Tommy all along. A real man
             who can give me sons.

The girls all titter at that. And Kiersten's minions quickly
change the subject.

                         JENNA
             What magic are you hoping for,
             Kiersten?

                         KIERSTEN
             It's not about hope. My magic is
             already coming in. I can feel it
             tingling deep inside me... Here.

She presses her hands into her abdomen just below her navel.
The other girls murmur, intrigued.

Behind them, a Guard COUGHS uncomfortably. Eavesdropping.

                         OTHER GIRLS
             Tell us! / Please? / What is it?

Kiersten considers. Playing up the drama. So the other girls
are hanging on every word. Then, almost casually:

                         KIERSTEN
             I can control people with my
             thoughts.

Someone SNORTS. It's Gertrude.

Kiersten looks up sharply. But rather than confront Gertrude
directly... She turns to the girl next to her-- BETSY,
plain, and slight, and fragile.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             And what magic are you hoping for,
             Betsy? The power to turn back time?

Betsy shrinks in the sudden spotlight.
                                                            27.


                         BETSY
             Why would I want that?

Kiersten smiles sweetly.

                         KIERSTEN
             So you might think twice about
             meeting Owen Gains in the meadow.

Betsy flushes. The other girls gasp at the scandal.

                         BETSY
             He said if I... He promised me a
             veil...!

Kiersten leans in. Her sweet smile turning cold.

                         KIERSTEN
             And instead he made you a whore.

Betsy looks stricken. The other girls laugh openly. Her eyes
fill with tears. She gets up and BOLTS for the woods...

The Guards react--

                         GUARDS
             Hey! / Get back here! / Where do you
             think you're going?!

--but they make no move to follow. She's on her own.

Kiersten looks at Tierney across the fire. Still smiling.
Another kind of fire burning in her eyes.

                         KIERSTEN
             See what I made her do?

Tierney looks away. No one speaks. They stare out into the
forest with baited breath. Even the Guards.

A GUTTURAL ROAR cuts through the night. Everyone flinches.

Then another ROAR sounds out. And another. And another.
Coming from all directions. A call and response, like a pack
of wild dogs. The Ghosts.

And then comes the SCREAMING. Screams of terror. And pain.

The Guards tense. Closing their ranks around the fire.

                         SHORT GUARD
             Anyone else feel like running?
                                                           28.


No one's laughing now. Even Kiersten's smile is gone. Some
girls start to cry. They all wince with every new scream.

                         RACHEL
             I told you. They're watching us.


EXT. FOREST - DAY

The girls walk. Veils leading the pack, the unveiled
following behind. Tierney observes them quietly:

HANNAH uses a walking stick, hobbling painfully.

VIVIAN picks berries from nearby bushes.

Laura stops now and then to pick up large rocks. She slips
them into her pockets and continues on.

Gertrude walks alone, as usual. Also observing.

And Kiersten moves from one cluster of girls to another,
whispering. The girls all turn back abruptly, looking at
Tierney. Are they talking about her??

Gertrude notices it, too. She falls back to Tierney.

                         GERTRUDE
             You need to be careful.

                          TIERNEY
                   (bristles)
             Of Kiersten?

                         GERTRUDE
             You saw what she did to Betsy.

                         TIERNEY
             You think her magic has come in?

                         GERTRUDE
             It doesn't matter. Magic or not, it
             was her doing.

Tierney regards Gertrude. The gloves hiding her hands.

                         TIERNEY
             Didn't you two used to be friends?

Gertrude looks at her. Eyes haunted. About to answer...

Suddenly, Gertrude TRIPS on a root. She stumbles, almost
falls, but Tierney catches her. And when they look up--
                                                            29.


Up ahead, Kiersten is LOOKING AT THEM. A little smile on her
face. As if she made it happen.

Gertrude clams up. She moves ahead, leaving Tierney alone.


LATER

The girls and their guards reach a lake. Four canoes waiting
on the shore. The girls climb in, squeezing together, as the
Guards unload the supply wagon.

Laura stops to dig a large, heavy stone out of the wet
earth. She hides it under her cloak, already sagging and
heavy with rocks.

Tierney watches. Curious. What is she doing...?

The Guards begin to paddle.

Kiersten reaches over the side of the adjacent boat and
skims her fingers along the water...

Tierney keeps her eyes on Laura-- two rows in front, staring
straight ahead.

The canoes reach the middle of the lake. Laura slowly turns
her head...

For a brief moment, she looks at Tierney.

And then she drops over the side of the canoe.

The other girls scream. The Guards scramble. The Tall Guard
DIVES into the water after her--

                         SHORT GUARD
             She was just-- Out of nowhere-- I
             didn't...

The Tall Guard comes up sputtering. Empty-handed.

The Short Guard helps him back into the boat. They both look
spooked. The Tall Guard shivers, soaked to the bone.

In the next boat, Kiersten pulls her hand from the water.
The other girls gape. Did she do that??


EXT. FOREST - DAY

The girls walk, a new wagon carting their supplies behind
them. The lake is just a distant glimmer.
                                                            30.


Tierney stares out into the forest, mind wandering...
Suddenly, in the distance she sees--

A FIGURE, vaguely human, cloaked in a dark shroud. Standing
perfectly still. Watching them.

Tierney stops short. The girl behind her KNOCKS into her--

                         GIRL BEHIND HER
             Hey!

When Tierney looks up again-- the Figure is gone.

                         TIERNEY
             Sorry... sorry...

She starts walking again. Puzzled. Scanning the woods... but
whatever it was, it's gone. If it was ever there at all.

Up ahead, the guards stop. The girls gather behind them.
Tierney approaches to see--

A TOWERING WOODEN GATE

Adorned with hundreds of red ribbons. Some tattered and
faded. Some a crisp, deep crimson.

A tribute to the many girls who didn't survive their Grace
Year. And a warning-- that the hardest part is yet to come.

The guards pull open the gate.

                         TALL GUARD
             Go on. Inside.

The girls just look at them. Scared and unsure. Finally--

Kiersten strides in, ready to take charge. Tierney and the
other girls trickle in after her...


INT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS

A massive open plot of land. A primitive lodge house at one
end. Two small shacks at the other end. An old stone well in
the center and one lone tree. A pile of smoldering ashes
scattered beneath it. An axe resting against the fence.

The girls gape in shock. Disbelief. Horror. For the next
year, this is home.

                         VIVIAN
             This can't be it... For a whole year?
                                                            31.


One girl, HANNAH, nudges the pile of ashes with her foot.

                         HANNAH
             I heard they did this. But I didn't
             believe it. It's the remaining
             supplies. Everything they built...
             everything they used to get through
             the year.

                         JENNA
             But-- why would they burn it?

Hannah looks at the lone tree. Forty-six notches carved into
its trunk. One of them fresh.

                         HANNAH
             Because it was done to them. Year
             after year...

But Tierney has noticed something else. Something RED in the
dirt. Little drops-- of blood.

Another drop splashes down, staining the dirt. It's just
like her dream...

Helen suddenly GASPS. She points up at the gnarled limbs of
the tree. The other girls follow her gaze. And now we see:

The tree branches are adorned with BODY PARTS.

The other girls back away, but Kiersten steps forward.

                         KIERSTEN
             It's a Punishment Tree. Just like the
             one in the square.

                         HANNAH
             But... who's going to do the
             punishing? At home the judges are the
             men of the Council, chosen by God.

The other girls murmur in agreement. They've never been
alone like this before...

                         KIERSTEN
             What do they say about the Grace
             Year? What's said here... what
             happens here... remains here forever.
             That is our most sacred vow. We are
             the only gods here.

And we can see it in her face-- the rush of power.
                                                            32.


Something SLAMS behind them. The girls all whirl around to
see-- the GATE is closed. The Guards are gone.

They're on their own.


QUICK CUTS OF THE ENCAMPMENT

--THE PRIVY, smeared with festering filth and buzzing flies.

--THE LARDER, dank and empty save for a small sack of
spoiled grain.

--THE WELL, slimy green algae clinging to the stones, the
rope, the bucket.

--THE LODGE HOUSE, dark and ominous...


INT. LODGE HOUSE - DAY

The doors creak open to reveal-- twenty iron beds set up
with putrid mattresses. The rest piled up in a corner. The
room reeks of rot and decay.

                         HELEN
             There aren't enough mattresses.

Vivian pokes at one of the mattresses in disgust.

                         VIVIAN
             And this one is... wet.

                         DENA
             Do we really have to sleep here?

                          JENNA
             You don't.

Tierney looks around-- waiting for someone to propose a
solution. But the other girls just look lost and helpless.

Kiersten struts over to the side with the mattressed beds
and sits down on the center bed like it's a throne.

                         KIERSTEN
             Veiled girls on this side.

The veiled girls quickly scramble to join her. Only Tierney
and Gertrude stand back with the others. They're used to
being outcasts.

It's a test. Battle lines being drawn.
                                                           33.


                         GERTRUDE
             Everyone needs a place to sleep.

Kiersten and the veiled girls watch from across the room...

...as Tierney, Gertrude, and the unveiled girls work
together to take down the stack of bed frames.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

The girls all sit around a fire. Kiersten holds court over
the veiled girls. The others have separated into smaller
groups. Suddenly--

A high-pitched SHRIEK pierces the night air. From somewhere
out in the forest. The girls all freeze. Shaken. Thrilled.

                            JENNA
             Ghost.

Tierney looks like she wants to say something... but she
holds her tongue.

Jessica nods sagely.

                         JESSICA
             Poor girls. Clinging to their magic,
             even in death. Even though it
             tortures them.

                         HELEN
                   (nervous)
             But... they can't come in here, can
             they? Into the Encampment?

Now Meg pipes up, eager to contribute.

                         MEG
             No. The Encampment is sacred ground.
             That's why they're so angry. And why
             they're so eager to kill us the
             second we leave.

Another SHRIEK echoes out. Some girls jolt, others tremble,
one of them starts to cry. They're terrified.

And Tierney can't keep quiet any longer.

                            TIERNEY
             It's an elk.

All eyes turn to her.
                                                            34.


                         JENNA
             How would you know?

Hannah pipes up timidly.

                         HANNAH
             Is that your magic, Tierney? Knowing
             things...?

Tierney shrugs. Uncomfortable in the spotlight.

                         TIERNEY
             I used to go into the northern
             forests with my Father this time of
             year to check on the trappers. That's
             the sound they make when they're
             looking for a mate. The elk, I mean.
             Not the trappers.

The girls smile. But Kiersten just sneers.

                         KIERSTEN
             See? Not magic. Just her Father
             treating her as a son all her life.

The other girls giggle, but there's a moment of tension.
Tierney can feel them eyeing her.

Another SHRIEK-- but the girls don't seem to mind. They're
talking, settling in, enjoying this taste of freedom...

Until Kiersten suddenly pulls the red ribbon out of her hair
and shakes her braids free. Her long hair spills down over
her shoulders in waves, glowing in the firelight.

The other girls gasp. Scandalized. Thrilled.

                          GIRLS
             What are you doing?! / Your ribbon--!
             / Your hair!

                         KIERSTEN
             Who's going to stop me?

The other girls look at each other. She has a point.

Rachel eagerly reaches for her own ribbon... but Kiersten
GRABS her wrist. Hard.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             No. Only girls who have claimed their
             magic can remove their braid.
                         (MORE)
                                                         35.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             We all know I have. Can anyone else
             claim the same?

The other girls titter with excitement and Kiersten basks in
the attention. Pleased to have the spotlight back.

Tierney touches her own braid wistfully.

                         BEHIND HER
             This is how it starts.

Tierney turns; it was Gertrude who spoke, talking to herself.

                          TIERNEY
             What?

Gertrude just stares into the fire.

                         GERTRUDE
             This is how we turn against each
             other.

Tierney watches the other girls. Unsettled...


EXT. TOWN - SUNRISE (DREAM)

We float toward the church, the Punishment Tree, where the
HANGED WOMAN is waiting.

She stands on the platform with the noose around her broken
neck. Head bowed. Hair hanging in her face. Shroud billowing
around her.

Blood drips from her hands, pooling on the ground below. And
then suddenly--

Her head JERKS UP. Her mouth twists into a SNARL.

And she LUNGES off the platform right at us--


INT. LODGE HOUSE - DAWN

Tierney gasps awake. She looks around-- did anyone notice?

No. Everyone seems to be sleeping. But the gray light of dawn
is seeping through the cracks in the rough-hewn walls...

She shivers. Her breath PUFFS in little clouds in front of
her face. It's cold.
                                                           36.


Tierney slips out of bed, pulls on her mother's heavy coat.
Time to work.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAWN

THWACK! Tierney heaves the axe to split a tree branch. A
stack of logs piled nearby.

She's alone, isolated, at the far end of the Encampment. The
white noise of the forest a deafening buzz all around her.

She pauses to wipe her brow, when--

Something CRUNCHES on the other side of the high fence that
separates the camp from the outside world.

Tierney freezes. All her senses attuned.

She tightens her grip on the axe and slinks forward...
careful to make no sound... toward a KNOTHOLE in the fence.

Slowly... cautiously... she presses her eye to the hole...

MOVEMENT FLASHES BY--

                         TIERNEY
             Gah--!

Tierney stumbles backwards. She clutches the axe to her.
Adrenaline pumping... Ready to strike...

But all she hears are the sounds of the forest.

Was that a ghost??


LATER

Tierney carries firewood toward the center of camp.

                         JESSICA (O.S.)
             Get back. Veiled girls first!

She comes around the privy to see Jessica and Jenna pushing
their way through a line of girls to the front of the well,
grabbing the algae-covered bucket from Martha.

That's when-- Gertrude comes storming out of the lodge
house. Trembling with anger and humiliation.

                         GERTRUDE
             Who took them?! Who took my gloves!?
                                                            37.


For the first time, we see Gertrude's BARE HANDS-- the
thick, rope-like scars across her knuckles. The result of a
brutal beating.

The girls snicker. Murmurs of Dirty Gertie ripple through
the crowd. Jenna and Jessica just smirk.

                         JESSICA
             Must have been a ghost.

                         JENNA
             Try not to touch anyone. You don't
             want to make them dirty, too.

Jessica and Jenna drink their fill, shove the bucket back to
Martha, and stride off to find Kiersten.

Martha sips some water, makes a face.

                         MARTHA
             Ugh. Is this all there is to drink?

Tierney hesitates. Weighing her options... and finally--

                         TIERNEY
             We could make rain barrels.

                         MARTHA
                   (impressed)
             You know how to do that?

Nearby, Lucy and Helen perk up, shy but interested.

                         TIERNEY
             It's a lot of work. But if we can
             find the right tools...

Gertrude approaches as well. Desperate to be included, to
put this latest humiliation behind her.

                         GERTRUDE
             ...I'd like to help.

The other girls look at Tierney-- is she really going to
include this outcast? But Tierney just nods.

                         TIERNEY
             We can use all the help we can get.


SERIES OF SHOTS

Tierney and the other girls get to work:
                                                            38.


--CHOPPING wood into planks.

--SIFTING through the ashes at the base of the Punishment
Tree to find stray nails.

--RIPPING into their skirts to remove the boning.

--SHARPENING knives on a smooth stone.

--STACKING firewood into piles.

--STANDING BACK to admire-- their first rain barrel.

They smile at each other, feeling accomplished. They built
this thing. And they did it together.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DUSK

Tierney and her new friends return to the center of camp,
exhausted and dirty from a hard day's work, to find:

The other girls are holding hands in a circle around--

DENA, standing naked, with Kiersten at her side.

                         HELEN
             What are they doing?

Dena shivers. Cold, nervous. Feeling everyone's eyes on her.
She squirms as Kiersten presses a palm into her abdomen.

                         KIERSTEN
             You should feel it here. A warmth, a
             tingling. Like your blood is reaching
             for the surface, wanting to scream.
             Do you feel it?

                          DENA
                    (whispers)
             Yes.

                         KIERSTEN
             That's your magic. Latch onto it.
             Welcome it. Keep pulling it forward.

Dena clenches her eyes shut, takes a few deep breaths.

                         DENA
             I think I feel something.

                         KIERSTEN
             Now get on all fours.
                                                            39.


                           DENA
             Wh-why?

                           KIERSTEN
             Just do it.

Dena gets down on all fours.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             Reach out to the animals of the
             forest. Feel their presence.

                         DENA
             I don't know how.

                         KIERSTEN
             Close your eyes. Feel every heart
             beating in the woods. Find one. Focus
             in on that rhythm.

Dena lifts her head. Eyes straining toward the forest.

                         DENA
             I hear something. I feel heat. Blood.
             I smell... damp fur.

Suddenly-- A HOWL comes from the woods. Everyone jumps. But
Dena looks the most surprised of all.

Kiersten gives Dena's braid a painful YANK.

                           KIERSTEN
             Answer.

Tierney watches, spellbound. Is this what it's like? Coming
into your magic?

Dena digs her fingernails into the earth and HOWLS back.
Stretching her neck. Straining for the magic within her.

She keeps howling until her cheeks are flushed and streaked
with tears. Finally-- Kiersten PULLS the red ribbon from her
braid, letting her hair fall wild and loose around her.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             I knew you could do it.

Dena stands up, rising like a woman reborn. She takes
Kiersten's hand. The circle parts to let them through and
they walk toward the lodge house together.

The other girls watch. Awed and envious...
                                                            40.


INT. LODGE HOUSE - DAWN

Again, Tierney wakes before the others. Again, she quietly
slips out.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - MORNING

The axe rests near another pile of split logs as--

Tierney is on the ground on all fours. Hands pressing into
the earth. Eyes closed. Imitating Dena.

But finally... her eyes open, defeated. Nothing.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY

Four rain barrels are now situated around the Encampment,
along with two big wash tubs by the well. There's even a
covered area for cooking.

Tierney and her friends have been busy.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY

Tierney and her friends take turns chopping wood. The puffs
of their breath visible even in the mid-day sun.

Tierney tests the icy mud with her boot, frowns. Winter
won't be long.

                         LUCY
                   (chopping wood)
             Why are we... the only ones... out
             here? What are they... doing all day?

She passes the axe to Martha, who starts chopping.

                         MARTHA
             Whatever it is... it sure makes them
             hungry... The larder's... already...
             half empty.

She passes the axe to Helen, who is gazing up at the trees...

                            TIERNEY
             Helen?

Helen turns, as if in a dream. She looks down at the axe in
her hands, like she doesn't know how it got there.
                                                            41.


Tierney looks up at the trees, wondering what had Helen so
entranced. For a moment, the leaves seem to RIPPLE and
PULSE. But then she blinks, and the effect is gone.

Just an illusion... or something more?


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

Tierney and friends stagger to the nightly bonfire.
Blistered, sweaty, exhausted. Meanwhile:

Tammy sways in the breeze, lost in a reverie.

                         TAMMY
             I can hear the wind whispering!

Hannah holds up a withered flower.

                         HANNAH
             I made it wilt just by looking at it!

With great ceremony, Kiersten unties the red ribbons from
Tammy and Hannah's braids. They shake their hair loose as
the other girls rejoice around them.

Suddenly, Meg swipes her hand through the flames.

                         MEG
             I... I can't feel it!

Meg looks at Kiersten for approval. The other girls buzz.

Meg tries again. This time she HOLDS her hand in the flames.
That gets Tierney's attention.

                         TIERNEY
             What are you doing?!

                         MEG
             I can't feel it...

Meg watches as the skin of her hand starts to BUBBLE. The
other girls watch too. No one tries to intervene.

Tierney GRABS Meg and PULLS her away.

                         TIERNEY
             I need water! And bandages!

Gertrude rushes to help. But no one else moves.
                                                            42.


Meg looks up at Tierney. Her eyes are HUGE AND BLACK. She
starts to LAUGH.

And all the other girls start laughing, too. Everyone except
Kiersten, who watches Tierney closely.


INT. LODGE HOUSE - NIGHT

Tierney flops into bed, exhausted, as--

A handful of unveiled girls drag their beds over to
Kiersten's side of the room. The divide is growing...

Tierney leans in to Gertrude. Whispering in the dark.

                         TIERNEY
             Have you felt anything yet?

                         GERTRUDE
             It will happen. We just have to be
             patient.

But Tierney stares into the darkness, anxious and unsure.


INT. LODGE HOUSE - DAWN

Tierney flinches in her sleep. Her arms twitching. She gasps
awake to find--

ANTS crawling over her arm. She FLINGS the covers off--

Her entire body is covered with ants.

She flails. Scratching at her skin. She LEAPS out of bed--

And suddenly the ants are gone. She turns to inspect her
bed-- Nothing there.

She tries to calm down, catch her breath. What was that?

Then a thought occurs to her. She peers through the dim
light over to KIERSTEN'S BED... It's empty.

Tierney whirls around. Sensing someone watching her...


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAWN

Tierney is at the well, splashing cold water on her face.
But when she looks up, she sees--
                                                         43.


The RAIN BARRELS, that she and her friends worked so hard to
make, have all been SMASHED.

                         TIERNEY
             What--?

Tierney blinks. It can't be. Surely this is a vision, too.

Tammy passes by. Loose hair tangled and matted. Eyes black.

                         TAMMY
             A ghost did it.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY

Tierney, Gertrude, Lucy, Helen, and Martha stare down at one
of the smashed barrels. Exhausted and demoralized.

                         TIERNEY
             So we'll... build more...

But Lucy has had enough. She goes to join Kiersten's group.
Helen and Martha stare after her longingly.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY

Tierney sits alone in the trees by the far fence, trying to
reassemble the rain barrel on her own.

Gertrude approaches with a cup of water.

                         GERTRUDE
             Don't know why you'd bother. They'll
             just end up smashed again.

                         TIERNEY
             Are Helen and Martha...?

But Gertrude's look says it all:   they're not coming.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             But why the rain barrels? It doesn't
             make sense. They were for everyone...

                         GERTRUDE
             That's Kiersten for you.

Tierney takes the cup, and she can't help staring at
Gertrude's HANDS-- the scars across her knuckles.
                                                            44.


                         GERTRUDE (cont'd)
             Go ahead. Ask me.

Tierney hesitates. Sheepish.

                         TIERNEY
             Is it true? You were punished for...
                   (a whisper)
             Depravity?

                         GERTRUDE
             It's... complicated. I helped
             Kiersten steal something from her
             home. And when we got caught with
             it-- I took the blame. I thought it
             would be easier that way, that I was
             helping her...

                         TIERNEY
             Why would Kiersten steal something
             from her own home?

Gertrude looks nervous. But she sighs. Resigned.

                          GERTRUDE
             It was her father's. A lithograph. He
             has a whole collection, from long ago.
                   (beat)
             It was a picture of a woman. She was
             naked. And she was-- touching herself.

Tierney's breath hitches with shock.

                         TIERNEY
             That's why Kiersten calls you Dirty
             Gertie? But-- you were friends! How
             could she let you take the blame--
             and then ostracize you for it? How
             could you let her get away with it?

Gertrude shrugs sadly. As if she's asked herself the same
thing many times. She looks at Tierney; open, vulnerable.

                          GERTRUDE
             She was scared. I thought, if I could
             be strong for both of us... things
             would go back to how they used to be.
             I know how that sounds, but... Have
             you ever been with someone who makes
             you feel like-- like you're two sides
             of a magnet?
                          (MORE)
                                                         45.

                         GERTRUDE (cont'd)
             Like there's an invisible force
             drawing you together, and there's
             nothing you can do to fight it, and
             when you touch, it's like-- there was
             a piece of you you never knew was
             missing, but finally you're... whole?

Off Tierney: realizing Gertrude feels that way about
Kiersten. And then realizing-- she has never felt that way
about anyone. Yet another thing that's wrong with her.

And Gertrude can see it on her face; Tierney doesn't
understand. So she puts her guard back up.

                         GERTRUDE (cont'd)
             Never mind. The point is, there's no
             telling what Kiersten is capable of.

Tierney frowns. Taking Gertrude's warning to heart.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY

Tierney is still working on the barrel. But she seems to be
zoning out. Her concentration drifting.

Her gaze travels to the rough wood in her hands... The deep
ridges PULSE with energy to the rhythm of her heartbeat.

Tierney marvels. She runs her hand over the wood, and it
seems to WHISPER. She lifts it up, pressing it to her ear...

                            KIERSTEN
             Pretty.

Tierney drops the wood and whirls around-- Kiersten is
sitting on a nearby tree stump. She runs her hands over the
fur of Tierney's discarded coat. Admiring it.

                            TIERNEY
             That's mine.

Kiersten lifts her hands with a little smile. No harm done.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             What are you doing here?

                         KIERSTEN
             Believe it or not, I want to help you.

Tierney doesn't answer. She doesn't believe it.
                                                            46.


                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             I know what your problem is. Your
             magic hasn't come in. And you're
             wondering why, what's wrong with you.
             Are you doomed to repeat your
             mother's fate?

Tierney winces. That's exactly what she's been wondering.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             When really the explanation is
             obvious.

                         TIERNEY
             It is?

Kiersten moves toward her. Gentle and calm, like a friend.

                         KIERSTEN
             Completely. At least, to me. See, I
             think you actually have the opposite
             problem. I think you've been burning
             through your magic for years, right
             under all our noses. Maybe without
             even realizing it yourself.

Tierney reacts, shaken. Could that be true?

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             That's how you got your Father to
             teach you all those things.

Kiersten leans in close. And now all trace of her gentle
sweetness is gone. Replaced with cold, cruel contempt.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             That's how you stole Michael from me.
             And now... you're all. Used. Up.

And Tierney recoils. The spell is broken.

                         TIERNEY
             I didn't steal Michael. I don't even
             want Michael! I don't know why he
             chose me but it wasn't my doing.

The trees seem to PULSE with energy. She squeezes her eyes
shut. But when she opens them again, they're still PULSING.

                         KIERSTEN
             Regardless. All this work? It's a
             distraction for the rest of us.
                         (MORE)
                                                            47.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             We don't need to be comfortable and
             well fed. We need to focus on the
             only thing that matters. Our magic.

OFF TIERNEY: The trees are pressing in on her. Bending,
pulsing to the beat of her heart. Her head is spinning...

                         TIERNEY
             If we aren't prepared when winter
             comes, girls are going to die.

But Kiersten just laughs.

                         KIERSTEN
             It's the Grace Year, Tierney! Of
             course girls are going to die! The
             point is how we live while we're
             here-- in the one place, at the one
             time in our lives, when we can truly
             be free. No tempering our feelings or
             swallowing our pride. Everything
             that's inside us, we can just let it
             all out... until it's gone. And then
             we won’t have to feel anything at all.

Suddenly Kiersten looks lost. Sad. Intensely vulnerable.

Tierney closes her eyes. And when she opens them, finally,
mercifully, the vision is gone. The trees are just trees.
She sighs. Exasperated... and exhausted.

                         TIERNEY
             What do you want me to say? The other
             girls can do what they like. I don't
             know why my magic hasn't come in, but
             until it does... I can't just sit
             around and do nothing.

Kiersten shrugs. Suit yourself.

                         KIERSTEN
             Then I can't help you after all. You
             win, Tierney. You're on your own.
             Just the way you like it.

She picks up the axe and walks away. In the distance,
thunder RUMBLES in gathering storm clouds. A warning...


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY

Tierney is drinking from the well when-- she sees Kiersten
cornering Gertrude against the larder.
                                                          48.


Tierney hurries over-- but Kiersten gives Gertrude a pointed
look and strides away.

                         TIERNEY
             What was that about?

Gertrude can't quite meet Tierney's eyes.

                         GERTRUDE
             She apologized. She wants to be
             friends again.

                         TIERNEY
             After everything she did to you? You
             can't possibly believe her.

Gertrude looks away, toward the larger group of girls.

                         GERTRUDE
             You don't know what it's like. I
             just... I don't want to be Dirty
             Gertie. And she can make it stop.

And now Tierney connects the dots. Realizing...

                         TIERNEY
             And what did you promise her in
             return? For her friendship?

                         GERTRUDE
             I think it's best... if we don't
             speak anymore.

And just like that, Gertrude walks away.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - LATER

Tierney is alone in the trees at the back of the Encampment.
Down on all fours, naked this time, her hands and knees
pressed into the cold ground.

Gritting her teeth. Squeezing her eyes. Clenching every
muscle in her body. Willing her magic to come...

She feels a pinch. And another. She opens her eyes-- SPIDERS
are crawling all over her!

She shrieks-- leaps up-- smacking them off her--

And just as suddenly, the spiders are gone.

Tierney sinks to the ground. What is happening to her??
                                                            49.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - LATER

Heavy storm clouds block out the sun as Tierney returns to
the center of camp with an armful of firewood...

To find all the girls huddled around the front fence.
Kiersten is speaking to someone near the gate, impossible to
see who from the back of the crowd.

                         KIERSTEN
             All you have to do is run to the cove
             and back. Then I'll take out your
             braid, and you'll be one of us.

Tierney pushes her way to the front-- it's Helen. Looking
timid and unsure as Kiersten strokes her hair like a child.

                         TIERNEY
             She can't leave the Encampment!
             That's a death sentence!

                         KIERSTEN
             Her magic will protect her.

Helen looks at Tierney, her eyes glassy and dazed.

                         HELEN
             The ghosts can't see me if I'm
             invisible.

The other girls push Tierney back. Physically blocking her
from the front. Tierney scans the crowd for an ally.

                         KIERSTEN
             I'll even let you wear my veil.
             That's how much I believe in you.

Helen beams as Kiersten places a veil on her head.

                         TAMMY
             But-- that's my veil--

Kiersten gestures to Jenna and Jessica, who haul open the
gate. The forest stretches out before them, wild and dark.

The other girls step back. Kiersten nudges Helen forward.

                         KEIRSTEN
             You can do it. Go!

Thunder RUMBLES. Lightning CRACKS. And Helen TAKES OFF--
                                                            50.


                          TIERNEY
              Wait--!

The other girls let down their guard and Tierney shoves her
way forward-- through the crowd-- through the gate-- into


THE FOREST.

She stops, realizing what she's done. The trees loom over
her. The wind whips her. The noises of the forest echo...

For a moment, Tierney is frozen in fear. But she gathers her
courage and races down the path...

She spots Helen up ahead, the veil trailing behind her.

                          TIERNEY
              Helen!

Helen stops. She turns back, panicked.

                          HELEN
              You can see me?

A LIGHTNING STRIKE blinds them. When their vision clears--

A FIGURE emerges from the thicket of trees behind Helen.
Wrapped in a dark, gauzy shroud. A GHOST.

At first Tierney is too stunned to react. Totally paralyzed.

                          TIERNEY
              Helen...

Helen frowns. With growing dread she turns around--

The Ghost's shroud-covered arms SNAP HER NECK like a twig.

Helen crumples to the ground. Dead. And the Ghost lets out a
ROAR that echoes into the trees...

Then another ROAR bellows out of the brush. And another. And
another. Coming from all directions. They're everywhere.

That breaks Tierney's paralysis. She turns and flees, but--
THE GIRLS ARE CLOSING THE GATE.

                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
              NO--!

But the gate SLAMS shut. She POUNDS on the gate as her
heartbeat POUNDS in her ears. But it's no use.
                                                            51.


Behind her, the Ghost is fast approaching-- Tierney LEAPS up
onto the gate--

Grabbing the dead girls' ribbons, PULLING her way up...
DIGGING her fingernails into the splintery wood... CLAWING
and KICKING until she TOPPLES over the edge--


INT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS

--and lands hard on the ground. She made it. She's safe.

But then Kiersten is pressing the axe against her throat.

                         KIERSTEN
             Why did you do that?

                         TIERNEY
             I was trying... to save her!

                         KIERSTEN
             She would have been fine if you
             hadn't interfered!

Kiersten lifts the axe. She looks at the other girls now.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             Don't you see what she's doing? She
             wants you to deny your magic. She
             wants you to die out here! Or worse--
             to hold on to it so when we return to
             the county you'll be sent to the
             gallows. Just like her mother.

                         TIERNEY
             You're the reason Helen is dead--!

                         KIERSTEN
             All she wants is to turn us against
             each other... and away from what
             we're meant to do. But I say it's
             time we turn our backs on her. From
             this moment on, anyone who associates
             with this heretic will be punished.

Tierney watches, helpless, as the girls react. Averting
their eyes. Stepping back. Turning away.

She is an outcast. Friendless and alone.

And with the next cascade of thunder, the clouds open up and
SNOW begins to fall...
              52.




W I N T E R
                                                            53.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY

Icicles hang from the trees. Snow blankets the ground.

The covered area has been torn down. The wash tubs Tierney
and her friends built are all destroyed, their remnants
lying in useless piles as a reminder to all.

Tierney staggers through the camp, haggard and gaunt. Her
eyes are black and haunted. Her coat is matted and filthy.

No one speaks to her. No one looks at her. She might as well
be invisible. Until--

She goes to the well for a drink...

THUD! A stone lands at her feet. THUD! Another stone hits
her in the back. THUD! Another stone hits her in the
forehead, drawing blood.

Six girls hurl stones at her mercilessly, until she has no
choice but to retreat.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY

Tierney wanders aimlessly in the safety of the trees.
Staring vacantly as the branches pulse and the trunks swirl
and the light dances between them. Lost in a haze...


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY

The girls line up for supper. Almost all of them wear their
hair long and loose. Tammy scoops a thin stew into their
bowls one by one.

Tierney takes her place at the end of the line. When it's
her turn, Tammy scrapes the bottom of the kettle for the
last scoop of stew...

And pours it onto the ground.

Tierney drops to her hands and knees to eat off the ground--

But Katie digs her boot into the slop, SQUISHING Tierney's
fingers in the process.


INT. LODGE HOUSE - NIGHT

Tierney walks through the lodge house. Now ALL THE BEDFRAMES
are on Kiersten's side. All except one. Hers.
                                                            54.


She goes to her bed-- but the mattress is gone, and the
frame has been FLIPPED upside down. A message.

Tierney has no energy to fight. She curls up on the floor...

The door creaks open. Footsteps coming near.

Tierney TENSES. Like an animal playing dead. Waiting...

There's a soft TAP on the floor behind her back. And then
the footsteps quickly retreat. When the door creaks closed,
Tierney rolls over to find--

A POTATO. Smaller than her fist.

She sinks her teeth into it... Desperate for sustenance...

It takes every last bit of willpower to tuck half away in
her pocket for later.

She pulls her coat over her and drifts off to sleep...


INT. LODGE HOUSE - NIGHT

...until a KICK FROM A BOOT jolts her awake.

Kiersten and her posse are standing over her. Their eyes
black, their expressions a mix of dreamy and deranged.

                         KIERSTEN
             Hold her down. Empty her pockets.

                           TIERNEY
             ...wha...?

A dozen girls pin her to the floor. Hands invading her--

Jenna pulls the other half of the potato from her coat.

                         KIERSTEN
             You stole this from the larder.

Tierney's head is swimming.

                         TIERNEY
             No I... didn't...

                         KIERSTEN
             Then who gave it to you?

                         TIERNEY
             I just... I found it...
                                                           55.


                         KIERSTEN
             What happens to girls who lie?

                         JENNA
             They lose their tongues.

Kiersten smiles.

                         KIERSTEN
             Get the calipers.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

Tierney kicks and thrashes and screams as a mob of girls
drag her from the lodge house to The Punishment Tree.

They haul her up against it. Pinning her to it. And she has
no strength to fight them.

Hannah skips over with a rusty clamp.

Kiersten grabs Tierney's face, squeezing her cheeks.

                         KIERSTEN
             Stick out your tongue. Or stop me
             with your magic. If you can.

Tierney struggles against her...

                         IN THE CROWD
             Stop! I did it!

They all turn to see Gertrude stepping forward.

                         GERTRUDE
             I gave her the potato. Look at her.
             She's starving.

But Kiersten is looking at Gertrude. Her face inscrutable.

                         KIERSTEN
             Is this how you repay me? After
             everything I did for you? I gave you
             a second chance, I forgave you... And
             that still wasn't enough, was it? We
             both know what you really want.

Gertrude shirks back, eyes pleading.

                         GERTRUDE
             Don't... please...
                                                            56.


                         KIERSTEN
             Is anyone curious how Dirty Gertie
             got her name?

                         GERTRUDE
                   (fighting tears)
             Kiersten!

                         KIERSTEN
             She tried to kiss me. She wanted me
             to do the dirty things she found in a
             dirty picture. To sin against God.

The crowd of girls reacts-- horrified, outraged, gleeful.

Gertrude grabs Tierney's arm. Trying to lead her away.

                         GERTRUDE
             Come on. Let's go--

But suddenly Gertrude's head JERKS back. She cries out.
Falls to her knees. Blood pooling down her back as--

Kiersten clenches Gertrude's braid in her fist. A bloody
patch of scalp at one end, the red ribbon at the other. In
her other hand she holds the axe.

The other girls are stunned. Even Kiersten looks shocked.
But we watch her expression change as she decides to own
it-- to embrace it. She raises the bloody braid with glee.

                         KIERSTEN
             I warned you, didn't I? Those who
             help the heretic will be punished.

Tierney is horrified. She can barely whisper--

                         TIERNEY
             What did you do?

Kiersten ignores her. Drunk with power. Manic with energy.

                         KIERSTEN
             We thought shunning her would be
             enough. But we must expel this poison
             from our system. Open the gates.

Tierney backs away.

                         TIERNEY
             No. No, I'll... I'll put my hand in
             the fire. Or you can take my braid--
             my finger-- an ear--
                                                            57.


                         KIERSTEN
             Give her to the ghosts and be done.

Tierney staggers back. But the girls are surrounding her...
The trees pressing down from above... the high walls of the
fence closing in...

There is nowhere to run.

Dozens of hands are PUSHING her, SHOVING her, HERDING her
toward the gate. Dozens of faces SMILING and SCOWLING.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             Wait. I want her coat.

The hands RIP at her, TEARING at her clothes, trying to PRY
the coat away. Tierney clings to it desperately--

But then Kiersten is blocking her path, raising the axe.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             I said GIVE IT TO ME--

A HUSH falls over the girls. They drop their hands. Step
back. Their black eyes wide with surprise and fear.

Even Kiersten falls back. She looks at Tierney with a low,
nervous laugh...

And then they're all laughing. Tierney follows their gaze...

TO THE AXE EMBEDDED BETWEEN HER SHOULDER AND HER CHEST.

Her hands tremble as they reach for the handle. She YANKS--

The girls laugh harder. Tierney tugs and tugs until
finally-- she pulls the axe out. And a TORRENT OF BLOOD
comes gushing with it.

The girls laugh harder. Doubling over. Tears streaming.
Birds start to caw, a mocking sound. The trees seem to
shake, as if they're laughing, too.

And Tierney-- RUNS. Still gripping the axe.

Past the girls. Out the gates. Into the forest.

The laughter echoing behind her...


ON TIERNEY

Staggering through the woods, a trail of blood behind her.
                                                           58.


The ground sways under her feet. The trees seem to reach for
her. Shadows dancing all around...

Her vision blurs around the edges. The axe sags in her arms.
She's ready to collapse. When--

One of the shadows STEPS into the path behind her. A FIGURE
hidden by a shroud. A Ghost.

But Tierney keeps going. Lumbering toward--


THE LAKE.

Frozen over with ice. The moon shines down, creating a
perfect reflection on its surface.

Tierney pauses at the bank. Unsure. But THE GHOST is coming
toward her. A faceless angel of death.

Tierney steps out onto the ice. Testing the weight... It
holds! She takes another step. Another. Another...

CRAAAAAACK. She freezes. Slowly, she turns to the shore...

THE GHOST has followed her onto the ice. Reaching for her...

The wind whips her. The moonlight glints off the deep black
of her eyes. She looks completely unhinged.

                         TIERNEY
             Stay away from me!

With the last of her strength she raises the axe. Blood
trickles down the handle, pooling on the ice at her feet...

Tierney heaves the axe down into the ice.

The CRAAAAAAACK echoes all around her, and then suddenly

She PLUNGES down into the frigid water--

And everything goes

                                                  DARK.


A FRANTIC GASP OF BREATH AS--

IMAGES flash across the screen:

--A bonfire climbing into the night.
                                                          59.


--A serrated blade tearing through Tierney's clothes.

--A circle of women, dancing with arms outstretched.

--Strips of cloth tying down Tierney's arms and legs.

--Smiling, laughing, faces in the firelight.

--A hot iron searing into Tierney's shoulder flesh.

--The Woman, hanging from the Punishment Tree. But it's not
blood dripping from her hands. It's tiny RED FLOWER PETALS.

They spill onto the ground where twin patches of red flowers
are growing...


A ROOM

Gradually comes into focus:

Long strips of sinewy meat hanging from hooks. Tanned hides
drying on a rack. An assortment of knives and tools on a
rough table. A fire crackling in a hearth.

Tierney tries to sit up, only to find--

Her arms and legs are restrained. She starts to panic--

MOVEMENT in the corner as-- the SHROUDED FIGURE approaches.

Tierney reacts. Twisting and writhing in vain--

The Figure grabs her face. Squeezes her cheeks to open her
mouth. Tilts a cup to her lips. And now Tierney sees--

EYES staring down at her from a gap in the shroud. Dark and
piercing. As if they are staring into her very soul.

Tierney is so surprised that she chokes on the liquid. She
coughs and sputters--

But her vision blurs, and her eyes flutter closed...


INT. ROOM - LATER

Tierney wakes. The room is quiet and still. The fire has
gone out. She turns her head, looking around. No sign of The
Figure with the dark eyes. Suddenly--

A ROAR sounds in the distance. Followed by a chorus of ROARS
answering it, echoing from all directions. The Ghosts.
                                                            60.


She struggles against the restraint holding her good arm
down. Twisting, yanking, rubbing her skin raw. Bleeding onto
the bed. Gritting her teeth. Blinking back tears. But the
more she struggles, the tighter the restraint pulls. No use.

She thinks... looks around. There's a table on the other
side of her, but she can't see what's on it.

Her fingers are just close enough they might be able to
grasp the table leg-- but it's her bad arm. Can she do it?

She wiggles her fingers. They barely graze the table leg.

She stretches her arm out... pushing through the pain...
Until she has a firm grip on the table leg.

She takes a few quick, deep breaths. Steeling herself...

                         TIERNEY
             One... two... THREE--

She YANKS. The wound in her shoulder RIPS-- she CRIES OUT--
her arm goes LIMP-- but the table TIPS toward her, its
contents sliding onto her bed...

A glass vial of liquid. A roll of gauze. And-- A BLADE.

She twists her torso and pulls the pelts covering her with
her teeth, maneuvering the blade over to the other side of
the bed. The fingers of her good hand reach... stretch...

Got it. She positions the blade to slice through the hide.
Sawing... Sweating... Eyes on the door...

Until finally-- the hide tears enough that her hand slips
free. Success!

She rolls over and cuts through the restraint binding her
bad arm, still limp and useless at her side.

No matter. She sits up, pulls back the pelts, and cuts
through the strips binding her legs. She's free--!

SOUNDS come from outside the room. Oh shit. The Figure is
returning. And the table is overturned and there's blood on
the bed and severed restraints. What to do...?

Tierney acts fast. She THROWS HERSELF off the bed, landing
in a contorted heap on the floor. Face hidden. Perfectly
still. Playing dead.

TIERNEY'S POV:   We HEAR the Figure coming toward her.
                                                            61.


The Figure grabs her by the shoulders. Rolls her over...

NOW.

Tierney PLUNGES the blade into the shroud--

And it STICKS. Sliding into thick, solid flesh. Tierney
reacts, stunned--

The Figure cries out-- staggers back--

And Tierney sees her chance. She SCRAMBLES to her feet...

Her weak legs buckle under her. But she picks herself up.
Her left arm hanging limply, dead weight.

She scrambles for the doorway-- a thick hide, sunlight
shining behind it.

Behind her, The Figure calls out--

                         FIGURE
             Stop--!

And to our surprise, the Figure's voice is low, guttural.
It's the voice of a YOUNG MAN.

But Tierney ignores his warning. She LUNGES through--

INTO NOTHING BUT AIR. Oh shit. This room is in a--


EXT. TREE - CONTINUOUS

She loses her balance. Teetering toward the ground--

The Young Man GRABS her by her bad arm, JOLTING her to a
stop. She SCREAMS in agony--

                         YOUNG MAN
             Give me-- your other-- hand!

Tierney dangles over the edge. A forty foot drop to the
snow-covered ground. Wind biting into her bare skin.

                         YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
             Tierney!

The Young Man grips her from above, leaning over the edge of
the narrow platform on which this room-- A HUNTING BLIND --
has been built.
                                                            62.


Tierney reaches up. The Young Man grasps her good wrist and
pulls her up. Back into the--


INT. HUNTING BLIND - CONTINUOUS

They lay gasping on the floor. Tierney curled in the fetal
position. The Young Man clutching the wound in his abdomen.
Both of them reeling, for different reasons:

                         YOUNG MAN
             You... stabbed me...

                         TIERNEY
             You're not... a ghost...?

Suddenly her face contorts as something trickles down her
arm. A thick, oozing pus tinged with blood--

She looks down at the WOUND in her shoulder-- gaping open,
maggots squirming in rotted, gangrenous flesh.

The room seems to LURCH. Tierney's eyes roll back...


INT. HUNTING BLIND - LATER

She wakes up, back in bed. Her shoulder freshly bandaged.
The Young Man is sitting at her side. She RECOILS as he
presses his wrist to her forehead.

                         YOUNG MAN
             Your fever broke.

                            TIERNEY
             ...Water.

The Young Man lifts a cup to her lips. She drinks greedily--
until he pulls the cup away.

                            YOUNG MAN
             Slow.

                            TIERNEY
             Who are you?

He doesn't answer. Suddenly-- Tierney lurches over and
VOMITS over the side of the bed. Her vision blurs.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             What's happening to me?
                                                            63.


                         YOUNG MAN
             It's the infection.

                         TIERNEY
             Am I going to die?

                         YOUNG MAN
             I don't know.

His voice as flat and cold. As if to say, I don't care.
Tierney's eyelids start to flutter.

                         TIERNEY
             How do you... know my name...?

But he doesn't answer. And she succumbs to sleep...


INT. HUNTING BLIND - LATER

A chorus of echoing ROARS startles Tierney awake. She sits
up... winces. Her shoulder is throbbing. Across the room,
the Young Man stirring a pot over the fire.

                         TIERNEY
             I need medicine. Poppy... or valerian
             root... even willow bark--

                         YOUNG MAN
             No.

                         TIERNEY
             Please. I'm in-- so much pain.

                         YOUNG MAN
             At this point, it will do more harm
             than good.
                   (beat; reluctant)
             Are you hungry?

Tierney considers. Eyeing whatever's cooking in that pot.

                         TIERNEY
             Yes.

But he tosses a sack of walnuts onto her bed instead.
Tierney picks one up. The nut rattles inside the shell.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             How am I supposed to...?

He comes over and places a steel nutcracker in her bad hand.
                                                            64.


                         YOUNG MAN
             Don't try anything. I got careless
             once. I won't again.

Tierney tries to use the cracker, but...

                         TIERNEY
             It's too hard.

                         YOUNG MAN
             You need to start building muscle.

                         TIERNEY
             I can't do it.

                         YOUNG MAN
             Then you won't eat.

Tierney fumes. Famished and frustrated. But she keeps
trying... And finally-- the nut cracks open. She scoops out
the meat and wolfs it down. Then onto the next nut...

                         TIERNEY
             You're not a ghost.
                   (no answer)
             And you're not a girl.
                   (still no answer)
             Why are you dressed like that?

The Young Man bristles.

                         YOUNG MAN
             We wear our shrouds for protection.

                         TIERNEY
             From what? The ghosts?

He looks up sharply.

                          YOUNG MAN
             From you.

And with that, he turns his back to her once more.


INT. HUNTING BLIND - NIGHT

Tierney blinks awake from a fitful sleep to see The Young
Man tending the fire, his back to her. And for the first
time, we're really SEEING him:

His shroud is off, his body illuminated in the firelight--
                                                           65.


Lean muscle coiling under bare skin etched with scars. His
hair is dark and thick. His face sharp, angular.

Tierney watches. Motionless beneath the fur pelts. Taking in
the sight of him with quiet awe. Absolutely riveted.

He turns abruptly. She sees a FLASH of dark eyes-- but she
squeezes her eyes shut, feigning sleep. Did he see her...?!

When she finally dares to look again...

He's back to tending the fire. But now his shroud is on.


INT. HUNTING BLIND - DAY

Hidden beneath his shroud, the Young Man dresses Tierney's
wound. His movements are gruff, cursory.

                         TIERNEY
             What's your name?
                   (no answer)
             How do you know my name? Have we met?

Still no answer. Not a conversationalist, this guy.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             Are there others like you? Out here
             in the forest?

Oops; he drops the cloth. Tierney reaches for it--

                           TIERNEY (cont'd)
             Here--

--but her sudden movement startles him. He jolts away.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             Are you afraid of me?

                         YOUNG MAN
             You stabbed me.

She holds the cloth out to him. He eyes her warily. But
finally, he yanks the cloth out of her grasp--

And as he does, she GRABS his shroud with her good hand,
getting a fistful of fabric.

                         TIERNEY
             I want answers. Or I swear I will rip
             this thing right off--
                                                            66.


But he digs his fingers into her wound. She HOWLS with pain,
releasing her grip. Writhing on the table.

And by the time she can see past the pain, he's gone.


INT. HUNTING BLIND - NIGHT

It's full dark when he finally returns. Tierney is
practicing with the nutcracker, sitting by a fire.

                         YOUNG MAN
                   (surprised)
             You built a fire.

                         TIERNEY
             I got tired of sitting in the dark.

They regard each other for a moment. Wary.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             I'm sorry I grabbed you.

The Young Man considers. And finally, reluctantly...

                         YOUNG MAN
             I think, if I were in your position,
             I would have done the same.

He sits down, still careful to keep his distance.

                         YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
             You want answers.

OFF TIERNEY: both relieved to be talking and terrified of
what he might say. But the not-knowing is worse, so:

                         TIERNEY
             ...Yes.

                         YOUNG MAN
             I'm a Poacher. I patrol the forest to
             keep the County safe.

                         TIERNEY
             By killing innocent girls?

                         YOUNG MAN
             They're hardly innocent if they break
             the rules and leave the Encampment.

Tierney reels. Trying to process. Her voice trembling:
                                                         67.


                         TIERNEY
             Did you kill Helen?

                         YOUNG MAN
             I don't know.

                         TIERNEY
             She was running toward the lake. A
             ghost-- someone snapped her neck.

                         YOUNG MAN
             No. That wasn't me.

As they go, Tierney's fear turns into anger, and their
conversation takes on a RAPID FIRE feel:

                         TIERNEY
             So there are more of you?

                         YOUNG MAN
             Yes. Many more. Maybe a dozen.

                         TIERNEY
             I've lived in the County all my life
             and I've never heard of Poachers.

                         YOUNG MAN
             No, you hear stories about ghosts who
             haunt the woods and kill any girl who
             strays from the path. You hear what
             they want you to hear, whatever they
             think will keep you in line and in
             the Encampment where you belong. And
             when that doesn't work... we take
             matters into our own hands.

                         TIERNEY
             But-- why would they lie to us?

                         YOUNG MAN
             For the same reason they banish you
             from your homes and lock you away in
             a cage for a year. Because they're
             afraid of you. And your magic.

                         TIERNEY
                   (sneers)
             That's why you wear this... bed
             sheet? To protect you from my magic?

                         YOUNG MAN
             Yes.
                                                         68.


                         TIERNEY
             Well then you don't have to worry. My
             magic hasn't come in yet. You're safe.

                         YOUNG MAN
                   (snorts)
             Exactly what you would say.

                         TIERNEY
             Do you think if I had even an ounce
             of magical ability I would still be
             here in this... this... tree house
             butcher shop?

                         YOUNG MAN
             It's a hunting blind.

                         TIERNEY
             Well it's hideous. And it smells.

                           YOUNG MAN
             That's you.

Oh. They stare each other down. A silent stand off.

                         TIERNEY
             Why didn't you kill me?

But this time, the Young Man doesn't answer.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             I broke the rules. I left the
             Encampment. Am I a threat?

                         YOUNG MAN
             I'm done talking.

He gets up, crosses the room--

                         TIERNEY
             You know, for someone going to such
             trouble to keep me alive, you don't
             seem terribly happy about it.
                   (no answer)
             How do you know my name?!


INT. HUNTING BLIND - NIGHT

Tierney wakes to find the Young Man draping pelts over a
fishing line strung across the room-- a makeshift curtain to
hide a small metal tub filled with steaming water.
                                                           69.


                         YOUNG MAN
             You need a bath.

Tierney almost dives off the table. Yes. She starts to strip
off her chemise-- then pauses. Suddenly very aware that she
will be taking off her clothes with an audience.

But the Young Man is busying himself across the room.
Keeping his back turned.

Tierney quickly undresses and slides into the water.

                           TIERNEY
             Ahhhhhhh...

She can't help herself. It feels like heaven.

                         YOUNG MAN
             There's tea tree oil for your hair.
             And a salve for your scars.

Tierney peeks through the pelts, watching him. Curious and
energized by the illicit thrill of what she's doing.

                         TIERNEY
             Why won't you tell me your name?
                   (no answer)
             You know mine. It's only fair.
                   (still nothing)
             What should I call you then? Boy?

Under the shroud, she can see his body tense. She's gotten
under his skin. And there's a part of her that feels smug.

                         YOUNG MAN
             How about you don't talk to me at
             all?

Fine. She massages the tea tree oil into her hair... And
then a new thought occurs, and her smugness vanishes.

                         TIERNEY
             Well. Whoever you are... Thank you.
             For this, and... for saving my life.
             Whatever your reasons.

She doesn't expect an answer, of course...

                         YOUNG MAN
             You're welcome.

She looks over at him, surprised. And as she sinks down into
the water... she smiles.
                                                           70.


INT. HUNTING BLIND - DAY

The Young Man leans over Tierney to change her bandages.

                         YOUNG MAN
             So. What happened to you?

Tierney can't believe it. He's initiating conversation?

                         TIERNEY
             Tell me your name.

                         YOUNG MAN
                   (sighs)
             Forget it.

                         TIERNEY
             It was an axe. One of the girls...
             she attacked me. And turned the
             others against me as well.

                         YOUNG MAN
             What did you do to her?

                         TIERNEY
             Nothing. She thinks I stole her
             husband-- which couldn't be further
             from the truth.

Is it her imagination, or does the Young Man suddenly tense?

                         YOUNG MAN
             That's right. You have a veil.

                         TIERNEY
                   (bitter)
             Not by choice.

                         YOUNG MAN
             What's wrong with him?

                         TIERNEY
             That's-- nothing's wrong with him.
             He's my best friend. I just never
             felt... And I thought he understood.
             He knew I didn't want to be a wife.

                         RYKER
             You don't love him. In that way.

Tierney flushes as he dabs her wound with witch hazel. His
touch is surprisingly gentle...
                                                           71.


                         TIERNEY
             What about you? Do you have... anyone?

                          YOUNG MAN
             My mother. My sisters. I do this work
             for them. To protect them, provide
             for them.
                   (beat)
             But no. There's no one... else.

They fall into silence. He reaches to wrap her new bandages,
and his shroud raises-- exposing small, tight stitches on
the side of his abdomen. The spot where she stabbed him.

Tierney reaches out and skims her thumb over it.

                         TIERNEY
             Did I do that?

The Young Man inhales sharply. But he doesn't pull away.

Tierney can feel his eyes on her. She meets his gaze. Their
faces so close, with only the gauze of the shroud between
them. An electricity in the air...

                         YOUNG MAN
             You could say... you've made a
             lasting impression.

He's still holding her hand.

They let their fingers intertwine. Marveling at the feel of
this unexpected touch...

It's just like Gertrude once said-- like they've been drawn
together by some invisible force. Magnets...

But suddenly-- SOUNDS come from outside. Boots trudging
through heavy snow. The clink of bone chimes.

Tierney freezes. Fear flashes in the Young Man's eyes.

                         POACHER (ANDERS) (O.S.)
             Ryker, you there?

The Young Man (RYKER) puts a finger to his lips. Quiet. He
pulls off his shroud and exits through the flap of hide.

                         RYKER (O.S.)
             Hey. Sorry. I was sleeping.

Tierney slips out of bed and grabs a blade from a far table.
She crouches low in the corner. Adrenaline pumping.
                                                            72.


                         ANDERS (O.S.)
             I bagged another one last night by
             the eastern fence.

                         RYKER (O.S.)
             Is that right?

                         ANDERS (O.S.)
             Sixteenth kill of the season. They're
             more reckless than usual. Must be
             strong magic.

Tierney reacts: Sixteen?!

                         ANDERS (O.S.) (cont'd)
             You sure you're alright?

                         RYKER (O.S.)
             Touch of fever. Just need some rest.

There's a pause in the conversation. Tierney tenses...

                         ANDERS (O.S.)
             Okay. But don't rest too long. You're
             missing out on a massive payday. You
             need anything, let me know.

The footsteps retreat. Ryker comes back inside...

But he STOPS when he sees Tierney crouching in the corner
with a blade. He goes perfectly still. Like a deer. His
protective shroud all the way across the room...

                         TIERNEY
             Ryker. That's your name.

Ryker raises his hands. A gesture of surrender. But Tierney
doesn't move. She grips the blade.

                         RYKER
             Just... take it easy...

                         TIERNEY
             Sixteen girls? Dead?

                         RYKER
             You'd rather we leave them to unleash
             their magic on anyone in their path?

There's another blade on the table next to him, but he
doesn't go for it. He keeps his hands raised.
                                                          73.


                         TIERNEY
             If that Poacher had found me here,
             would he have killed me?

                         RYKER
             No. I wouldn't let that happen.

                         TIERNEY
             Why not? Why do you care?

                         RYKER
             I don't.

But he looks away. He can't meet her gaze. Liar.

                         TIERNEY
             What aren't you telling me?

Ryker's jaw flexes. Some inner conflict brewing.

                         RYKER
             I made a promise. To keep you safe.

                         TIERNEY
             To who?

And now he does look at her. Steady and unwavering.

                         RYKER
             Your Father.

It feels like a punch in the gut. Like the air has been
ripped from her lungs. The blade trembles in her hand.

                         TIERNEY
             How... do you know my Father?

                         RYKER
             When you're ready-- when you're
             strong enough-- I'll show you.

She looks at him-- standing there, open and honest, with all
his secrets laid bare. Without his shroud he seems exposed,
vulnerable. And the way he makes her feel is undeniable.

Tierney considers. Can she really trust him...?

And finally-- she makes a decision. She puts the blade down,
slides it across the floor.

Truce.
              74.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Birds chirping. Trees budding with flowers. New growth on
the forest floor. And TWO FIGURES in heavy shrouds tramp
through the undergrowth, cresting a high ridge.

Only their eyes are visible, and we recognize them instantly:
Ryker... and Tierney. She's traded her veil for a shroud.

                         TIERNEY
             This is a terrible idea.

                         RYKER
             You're doing fine. Just relax. Act
             confident.

His hand brushes the small of her back. An intimate gesture,
but casual. A sign of their new comfort around each other.

                         TIERNEY
             If anyone catches me--

                         RYKER
             You're welcome to go back to the
             blind. But look-- we're here.

He crouches down low at the top of the ridge. Leaning over
the edge to see what's below. Tierney follows suit, peering
over the edge to see what's below--

THE OUTSKIRTS VILLAGE.

Thatched cottages nestled in a clearing. Strings of herbs
and freshly tanned hides and simple linen garments hanging
to dry in the sun. Children running wild between the trees.

And women. Chopping wood, doing wash, tending gardens, using
tools. So many women... and not a man in sight.

And Tierney is in awe. She's never seen anything like it.

                         TIERNEY
             What is this place?

                         RYKER
             My home. This is why I do what I do.
             To protect my people. To keep them
             safe.

                         TIERNEY
             It looks... like paradise.

Ryker darkens.
                                                            76.


                         RYKER
             It's not.

But Tierney doesn't notice. She's focused on something else:

The clearing is dotted with tiny RED FLOWERS. And there's
something about them that seems so familiar...

                         TIERNEY
             Those flowers...

But suddenly-- below them, a young woman comes into view.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             I know her! She used to work in the
             mill, but then-- she was banished...

                         RYKER
             Many of the women here were. The
             older wives, they don't tend to last
             very long. But the younger ones can
             earn a living.

There's something biting in his voice.

                         TIERNEY
             But-- where are the men?

                         RYKER
             They visit from time to time. Just
             long enough to satisfy their urges.
             Then it's back to town, to their
             pious wives and respectable families.
             But at least they pay for the
             pleasure-- just enough to keep their
             bastard children from starving.

As if on cue, a middle-aged man emerges from one of the
houses, buckling his belt and adjusting his coat.

                         TIERNEY
             No...

                         RYKER
             If you aren't lucky enough to be a
             wife or skilled enough to be a
             laborer... You can always be a whore.
             Their sons are raised to be trappers
             or poachers and their daughters age
             into the family trade. It's a hard
             life, but it could be worse. At least
             out here... we're free.
                                                         77.


Tierney gazes. Fascinated. Horrified. Unable to look away...

                          RYKER (cont'd)
             Your Father, he's one of the good
             ones. He comes here to heal, lends
             his services out of the goodness of
             his heart. My youngest sister, she
             was stricken with pox this time last
             year. He saved her life, refused any
             payment in return.
                   (beat)
             But he did ask a favor.

                         TIERNEY
             That you would protect me.

                           RYKER
             If I could.

But it's too much for Tierney. Her stomach lurches.

                         TIERNEY
             I'm going to--

She staggers to her feet and hurries down the hill. Tearing
off her shroud moments before--

She vomits into the underbrush. She needs... water...

Ryker's footsteps crunch behind her.

                         RYKER
             Are you alright--?

But the RUSH of a stream echoes out from somewhere nearby.
She follows the sound...

...and kneels down at a small brook. She cups her hands in
the water and lifts them to her lips to drink--

When Ryker suddenly SMACKS her hands away.

                           TIERNEY
             Hey--!

                         RYKER
             What are you doing?! That's hemlock
             silt!

He points-- the rocks in the stream are covered with ALGAE,
a green so bright it almost seems to glow.
                                                           78.


He's holding her shroud in his hands, and now he thrusts it
at her. Looking around, anxious.

                           RYKER (cont'd)
               Put this on before someone sees you.

But Tierney picks up one of the algae-covered rocks.
Studying it up close. Something so familiar about it...

                           TIERNEY
               What's hemlock silt?

                           RYKER
               It's-- I don't know, a fungus.
               Poisonous. It seeps into your mind.
               Even a drop on your tongue can
               incapacitate you for hours.

Off Tierney:   a dawning, dreadful realization...

                           TIERNEY
               And if you were drinking it by the
               cupful? All day... every day?

                           RYKER
               You would go insane.


INT. HUNTING BLIND - DAY

Tierney paces the algae rock, more distraught than ever.

                           TIERNEY
               The well in the Encampment is covered
               in this algae! It's the only water we
               have to drink! That's why the girls
               were acting crazy-- hallucinating and
               communing with nature and impervious
               to pain. I was, too. Seeing things,
               hearing things, that weren't really
               there. But it wasn't magic, it was
               poison.

But Ryker shakes his head.

                             RYKER
               I've seen a   girl take a dagger
               through the   gut and keep on charging.
               I've seen a   girl overpower three
               Poachers at   once...
                                                            79.


                         TIERNEY
             But have you ever seen one fly? Or
             disappear before your eyes? Have you
             ever seen them do anything but die?

Ryker doesn't answer.

                         RYKER
             What are you saying, Tierney?

                         TIERNEY
             Everything we've been taught is a
             lie. We thought the forest was filled
             with ghosts. We thought banishment
             from the County meant certain death.
                   (overcome)
             They let us think that we were
             dangerous... that we were powerful...
             That we needed to be purified... And
             all this time I thought there was
             something wrong with me-- because I
             couldn't...

But Ryker shakes his head. He won't believe it. He can't.

                         RYKER
             It doesn't make sense. How could they
             do that to their own wives? Their own
             daughters? Let you risk your lives
             and lose your minds? Let us kill you?

Tierney looks at him. The truth suddenly seems so obvious.

                          TIERNEY
             To break us. To make us meek and
             obedient and afraid. To keep
             themselves in power and keep us where
             we belong. And when they can't...
             they kill us.
                   (beat)
             Just like they killed my mother.

She looks at Ryker. Her entire body clenched in fury.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             They claimed she was hording her
             magic. My Father accused her. But it
             was all a lie. There is no magic.

But Ryker is shaking his head. Refusing to believe it.
                                                            80.


                         RYKER
             No. It's not true. It can't be true.
             If you're just-- girls... Then what
             does that make me?

His face twists with anguish, his stomach turns...

                         RYKER (cont'd)
             I'm sorry-- I can't--

...and he lurches for the door. Gone.


INT. HUNTING BLIND - NIGHT

Tierney sits by the fire. Wrapped in a pelt. Staring into
the flames. Lost in thought.

Her entire world has been dismantled. She is alone and in
shock. Feeling helpless and foolish and furious. She's
reached her lowest point. And then--

Slowly, deliberately, her hand goes to her hair. She pulls
the red ribbon from her braid and shakes her hair loose...

Letting it fall down her back... Running her fingers through
it... Feeling the weight of it...

An act of defiance. An act of freedom.

She tosses the red ribbon into the fire and watches it burn.


LATER

The flames have turned to embers when Ryker finally returns.
At first, he can't even look at her.

                         RYKER
             You have to know... If I'd thought
             for a moment I was-- murdering
             innocent girls...

                         TIERNEY
             I know. We've all been lied to.

The look in his eyes is pure misery as he turns to her,
desperate for absolution. But when he sees her-- he gasps.

                            RYKER
             Your hair...

Tierney looks at him, steady and calm.
                                                            81.


                         TIERNEY
             My entire life is dictated by men.
             The Father who raised me. The boy who
             will wed me. The Poacher who could
             save or end my life. How I dress, how
             I act, what I believe. But I won't
             live like that anymore. I'm done.

In the dying firelight, with her back rigid and her eyes
fierce and her hair cascading around her, Tierney has never
looked more powerful. Or more beautiful.

And Ryker is frozen in place. Staring at her.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             You can take off your shroud. You
             don't have to be afraid of me.

But Ryker doesn't move. The air between them is laced with
an electric charge.

                         RYKER
             I'm not-- afraid.

Tierney rises. The pelts slip off her, revealing her BARE
SKIN underneath. She goes to him-- eyes locked on his.
Entirely naked and entirely unashamed.

She moves toward him-- like some invisible force is drawing
them together, and there's nothing they can do to fight it.

She lifts his shroud the way Michael once lifted her veil.
Claiming him.

                          RYKER (cont'd)
             Tierney...

Tierney runs her hands over the scar she gave him, up his
torso, across his chest...

                         TIERNEY
             This is my body. And my life. And I
             will do with it what I please.

She leans into him, cupping his jaw, pulling his face to
hers... They kiss. Long and deep and tender.

His arms wrap around her. Skimming over her back. Tangling
in her hair.

They melt into each other like they've spent their entire
lives missing a piece and now finally-- they are whole.
                                                            82.


But it's more than just desire that's driving them. This is
an act of rebellion. Of revolution.

They sink down into the pelts, and the rest of the world
disappears. For this precious moment in time, there is
nothing but the HEAT of their breath and the RUSH of their
blood and the BEATING of their hearts...


LATER

Tierney and Ryker lie together under the pelts.

                         RYKER
             The moment I first saw you-- out on
             the ice... Wild and bleeding and half
             dead already. You looked so...

                         TIERNEY
             Helpless?

                         RYKER
             Defiant. When you struck the ice with
             that axe... it was one of the bravest
             things I've ever seen. Everything you
             do is on your own terms. Even dying.

He looks at her now with a new expression. Admiration. Awe.

                         TIERNEY
             I think... this may be the first time
             I've ever seen you smile.

And just like that, his smile fades.

                         RYKER
             What are we doing? I'm a Poacher and
             you have a husband waiting for you--

                         TIERNEY
             As if I would ever go back there.

                         RYKER
             Won't you? You have a life, a family.

                         TIERNEY
             Will you? Can you stay a Poacher, now
             that you know the truth?

Ryker frowns. He can't. He is just as unmoored as she is.
                                                            83.


                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             I could just stay here. Where things
             are simple. And I don't have to
             answer to anyone.

                         RYKER
             As long as you stay in hiding.

                         TIERNEY
             Then-- I'll leave. See what's out
             there beyond the forest. I can take
             care of myself.

                         RYKER
             I am well aware.

Ryker traces the long, jagged scar across her clavicle.

                         RYKER (cont'd)
             Last year a trapper brought us a
             message from a family we knew. They
             made it beyond the forest, over the
             mountains, to a settlement where men
             and women live side by side as
             equals. Where they're free.

Tierney considers. A future entirely of her own making...

                          TIERNEY
             Then that's it. That's what I'll do.
                   (beat)
             But there's something else I need to
             do first.

Ryker waits for her to elaborate. And then he realizes...

                          RYKER
             You're not serious. The Encampment?
             You can't go back there. They tried
             to kill you!

                         TIERNEY
             They didn't know what they were
             doing. They were out of their minds,
             just like I was.

                         RYKER
             You don't owe them anything.

But Tierney won't be swayed. She's made up her mind.
                                                            84.


                         TIERNEY
             It's not about me. They deserve to
             know the truth.

                         RYKER
             You'll be alone in there against all
             of them. If they turn on you again...

Tierney gets up and takes a blade from a nearby table.

                         TIERNEY
             Then I'll be ready.


INT. FOREST - DAY

Tierney wears a Poacher's shroud as she navigates through
the trees, alone. Making her way to--

The high walls of the Grace Year Encampment. Looming over
her like some eerie fortress. No telling what awaits inside.

She tests the walls for weaknesses, making her way around to
the back... There. One of the fence posts is rotted. Tierney
gives it a KICK-- her foot goes right through. An opening.

With a little grunt work, she pries away just enough of the
fence to squeeze through...

She hesitates. Glancing back toward Ryker's hunting blind.
It's not too late. She could just turn back, walk away, wash
her hands of the whole thing. It would be so easy...

But instead, she slips inside...


INT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS

Hiding among the trees, Tierney removes her shroud, folds it
up, and stuffs it in her dress.

She looks around. Takes a deep breath. And clutches Ryker's
blade, discreetly in one hand. Here goes nothing...


ON TIERNEY

She strides into the heart of the camp. Tense. Alert. Ready
for a fight. But completely unprepared for what she finds...

Now that she's clear-headed and healthy, whatever magical
veneer we once saw this place through is gone:
                                                            85.


The place is a wreck. Pots and kettles piled next to the
fire, rotting food curdling at the bottom. Empty jars and
cans strewn about. Rats and roaches scuttling underfoot.

The limbs of the Punishment Tree hang heavy with new body
parts and braids. One girl stands next to a branch stroking
the long braid that used to be attached to her head.

Most girls pass her by without a second glance, looking
right through her with glassy eyes.

Like zombies lurching through some post-apocalyptic
wasteland.

Dena staggers over to her, covered in dirt and grime.

                         DENA
             I know you...

Dena reaches up...

--Tierney's grip tightens around her blade--

...Dena simply scratches her head, pulling out a clump of
hair in the process. Then she simply staggers away.

Tierney shudders. She moves on. Walking slowly,
deliberately. Trying not to draw attention.

She opens the door to the--


INT. LODGE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

--and the STENCH of decay and disease knocks her back.

Girls like on cots, filthy and emaciated, barely breathing.
Some babble, eyes open, lost in a world of their own making.

Tierney searches their faces...

                          TIERNEY
             Gertie...?

Suddenly a HAND GRABS her ankle from under a bed.

Tierney SCREAMS-- SLASHING at the air with the blade--

But the girl peeks out from under the bed. It's HANNAH, with
a puckered SCAR where one eye used to be.

                         HANNAH
             Shhhh... you'll wake the ghosts.
                                                            86.


                         TIERNEY
             Hannah? What happened to you?

Hannah grins maniacally.

                         HANNAH
             I see them now. They're everywhere.
             All around us. I had to take out my
             eye to make it stop. But Gertie...
             they took her to the larder.

                           TIERNEY
             What? Why?

                         HANNAH
             Gertie was too dirty.

Hannah's body shakes. Is she laughing or crying? Maybe both.

Tierney backs away, uneasy. Feeling an increasing sense of
urgency and dread...

She hurries out of the lodge house--


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS

--heading for the larder. Moving fast, no concern for who
might see her. She pries the door open...

And a SWARM OF FLIES comes pouring out. But she pushes
through them to find--


INT. LARDER - CONTINUOUS

                           TIERNEY
             Gertie?!

Gertrude is laying on a cot piled high with ratty blankets.
A bucket of bile on the floor beside her.

                         GERTRUDE
                   (faint; weak)
             ...Tierney? Is that you...?

Tierney rushes to her. Lifting her up.

                         TIERNEY
             It's me. I'm here. There's so much I
             need to tell you--
                                                           87.


But Gertrude RETCHES into the bucket on the floor. She's
bone thin, her skin gray. The WOUND where Kiersten scalped
her is gooey and festering. It's a miracle she's even alive.

                         GERTRUDE
             I can't... keep anything down...

Tierney gently presses the swollen flesh around the wound.

                         TIERNEY
             Does this hurt?

                         GERTRUDE
             No, but... I think I lost my braid.

Tierney grimaces. She doesn't remember.

                         TIERNEY
             Don't worry. You're going to be
             alright--

                         KIERSTEN (O.S.)
             Where is she?

Tierney stiffens. She pulls a blanket over Gertrude and
stands up. Gertrude whimpers, but reassures her.

                         TIERNEY
             It's okay. I'll be right back.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS

Tierney emerges from the larder. Every muscle tensed. Blade
bared for all to see. And there she is:

Kiersten. Her skin sallow, her cheeks sunken, her hair
matted, her eyes completely black. Clutching the rusty axe.
Girls buzzing around her like flies.

Not some all-powerful mage, but still-- no less of a threat.

                         KIERSTEN
             We need firewood.

And yet, she has lost her spark, her fire. Her tone is flat,
emotionless; her gaze unfocused. She doesn't even seem to
notice Tierney's blade. The effects of prolonged poisoning.

And Tierney realizes-- Kiersten doesn't remember either.

                          TIERNEY
             Alright...
                                                            88.


Tierney reaches for the axe... But Kiersten pulls back.

                         KIERSTEN
             Hold on. You're not allowed to take
             out your braid unless you've embraced
             your magic.

Other girls close in. Sensing a confrontation. Tierney
thinks on her feet... How to diffuse this...?

                         TIERNEY
             But I have. You helped me. Remember?

Kiersten's eyes narrow. Suspicious.

Tierney looks at these girls. Starving, sick, completely
untethered from reality. No idea what they're capable of.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             You dared me to go into the woods. I
             was lost-- for a long time...

There are so many of them. She is overpowered, surrounded.
Her paltry blade looks ridiculous. No way she can win this
fight. What was she thinking? This was such a mistake--

But that's when one of the other girls pipes up:

                         RACHEL
             You survived the woods? The ghosts?

That's it. Tierney starts to form a new plan... Maybe she
can't outmatch them, but she can still outwit them.

                         TIERNEY
             Yes. The ghosts-- they spoke to me...
             saved me... They led me to a spring
             in the woods. Full of special water.
             I was sick, but the water healed me.

The girls murmur among themselves. Looking to Kiersten for
guidance. Kiersten herself seems to be plotting. Finally--

                         KIERSTEN
             Prove it.


EXT. FOREST - DAY

Tierney, wearing her shroud, carries a bucket of water
toward the Encampment. She's about to reach the main gate--

When ANOTHER POACHER emerges from the trees up ahead.
                                                           89.


                          POACHER
             Hey!

We recognize his voice. It's the Poacher who came to check
on Ryker that day. Anders.

Tierney freezes. Heart pounding in her ears. Using every
ounce of willpower not to break into a run.

                         ANDERS
             What are you doing?

He's coming toward her now. What is she going to do??
Tierney thinks fast...

She raises a finger to her lips. Shhh. And she points down
at the ground--

Tracks. Footprints leading from the Encampment down to the
lake. Fresh. Because they're hers.

Anders perks. He pulls out a blade.

Tierney gestures:   Around the side.

Anders nods. He slinks back into the trees, following the
tracks. Tierney stays frozen, listening to the sound of his
footsteps receding...

CRUNCH... CRUNCH... CRUNCH...

And when the sound fades out, she RUNS for the gate.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS

She stays there for a moment. Leaning against the gate until
her heart stops racing, her hands stop shaking.

That was close.

She takes off the shroud, folds it up, and knocks on the
gate...


INT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS

The girls let her in, wide-eyed. Kiersten inspects the water.

                          KIERSTEN
             You first.

Tierney dutifully takes a sip of water.
                                                            90.


                         TIERNEY
             See? It's good.

Kiersten glares; but she doesn't push back. The girls CLOSE
IN, eager to drink-- but Tierney stops them.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             The ghosts gave me this. They said
             you can have one sip each, for now.
             The rest is for supper.

The girls quickly form a line, eager to please the ghosts.

Tierney helps them each take a sip. But she also keeps a
close eye on Kiersten-- who is watching from the sidelines,
pacing like a tiger in a cage...


INT. LODGE HOUSE - SUNSET

Tierney spreads clay over Gertrude's scalp to heal it.

                         GERTRUDE
             I never told you the truth... about
             what really happened with Kiersten...

                         TIERNEY
             You don't owe me an explanation--

                         GERTRUDE
             No, I-- I want to. I need to.

Gertrude takes a deep breath. As if this is something she
has been holding in for a long time.

                         GERTRUDE (cont'd)
             When she showed me the lithograph, I
             thought she was trying to tell me
             something, give me some kind of sign.
             So-- I kissed her. Like we'd done a
             dozen times before. I wasn't asking her
             to do those things in the lithograph.
             It wasn't dirty. I'm not dirty. I was
             just trying to tell her...

                         TIERNEY
             That you loved her.

Gertrude relaxes. She can sense it; this time, Tierney truly
does understand.

Gertrude starts drifting off to sleep...
                                                           91.


                         GERTRUDE
             What... were you going to tell me?

                         TIERNEY
             It can wait. Get some rest.

Tierney gets up, tucks the blankets tightly around Gertrude.

                         GERTRUDE
             Tierney... it's like you're back from
             the dead.

                           TIERNEY
             Maybe I am.


EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

In her shroud, Tierney climbs up into Ryker's hunting blind.


INT. HUNTING BLIND - CONTINUOUS

She pulls off the shroud and Ryker is waiting with open
arms. She sinks into him. Physically and emotionally
exhausted. Letting the horrors of the day wash over her.

                         TIERNEY
             There's no getting through to them
             like this. They need time to get the
             poison out. To heal. So they can
             really understand.

                         RYKER
             So... you're staying?

                         TIERNEY
             For now. Don't get too comfortable.

She nuzzles into him. Nowhere she'd rather be.
              92.

SERIES OF SHOTS

As Tierney takes control of the Encampment...

--Near the Punishment Tree, Tierney doles out stew. She
gestures for the girls to form a line, and they meekly obey.

--At the well, Tierney cuts the rope and drops the bucket
down into the well. No more poison water. The other girls
watch, murmuring angrily. But they don't try to stop her.

--In the larder, Tierney organizes the food that hasn't
spoiled. Two other girls enter, volunteering to help.

--In the lodge house, Tierney supervises a dozen girls as
they beat mattresses, sweep away the filth, and rearrange
the beds into uniform rows.

--Around the campfire, the other girls settle around
Tierney, orbiting her like the sun. Only Kiersten continues
to keep her distance. Watching, waiting to strike.

--By the gates, Tierney brings fresh berries from the
forest. The girls flock to her, excited. Kiersten approaches
and pops a berry into her mouth with a little smirk. Now
that she's getting healthy, her spark is back. Which makes
her more dangerous than ever.

--And back in the hunting blind, Tierney stretches out in
front of the fire with Ryker as night settles in...


EXT. HUNTING BLIND - NIGHT

Ryker stands on the platform, feeling the night air as a
breeze rustles the tree leaves. When he comes inside...

                         RYKER
             Nights are getting warm again. You
             should think about--


INT. HUNTING BLIND - CONTINUOUS

...Tierney is rummaging, filling a pack with supplies. His
face falls. He knew this moment would come.

                         RYKER
             ...leaving soon.

                         TIERNEY
             You're right. They're healthy, lucid.
             They trust me. It's time.
                                                          94.


Ryker nods. Pained, but resigned.

                         RYKER
             Tomorrow, when the sun sets, go down
             to the lake, take one of the canoes.
             I'll cover you.

Tierney nods. Energized and overwhelmed... and guilty.

                         TIERNEY
             Do you think they'll be alright?

Ryker hears the tension in her voice, and the unspoken
question beneath her words: Will you be alright?

He goes to her, wraps her in his arms.

                         RYKER
             That's up to them. Either way, it's
             not your problem anymore.

Tierney leans into him. Feeling safe and secure and loved.
And here in this moment-- she makes a decision.

                         TIERNEY
             Come with me.

Ryker studies her.

                         RYKER
             You're sure...?

Tierney doesn't hesitate. She knows what she wants, and
she's not afraid to ask for it.

                         TIERNEY
             I'm sure.

Ryker reaches under the bed and pulls out-- his own pack and
bedroll. Ready to go.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             You knew I would ask?

                         RYKER
                   (a rare smile)
             No. But I hoped.

They wrap their arms around each other. Holding each other.

                         RYKER (cont'd)
             Tomorrow?
                                                           95.


                           TIERNEY
             Tomorrow.


INT. LODGE HOUSE - DAY

Tierney cleans and dresses Gertrude's wound. The infection
is almost gone. She keeps one eye on the open door--
outside, the sun is just beginning to set.

                         GERTRUDE
             You're different today.

                         TIERNEY
             There's something... I need to ask
             you. A favor.

Her hands are trembling. Gertrude notices. This is serious.

                           GERTRUDE
             Anything.

                         TIERNEY
             Will you tell Michael... I'm sorry.

Gertrude looks surprised... and then solemn. She understands.

                          GERTRUDE
             You have my word.
                   (beat)
             You're leaving?

Tierney nods. Fighting tears. And to her surprise--

Gertrude HUGS her. And Tierney hugs her right back. They
stay that way, locked in an embrace.

                         GERTRUDE (cont'd)
             Wherever you're going... Don't you
             dare look back.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - SUNSET

The sky is a brilliant orange as the girls sit around the
campfire eating their evening meal. The girls are noticeably
different. Stronger, clear-eyed.

They perk at A RUSTLING in the forest beyond the fence.
Hannah tilts her empty eye socket toward the sound.

                         HANNAH
             What are they saying?
                                                          96.


But Tierney is distant, distracted. Gertrude gently nudges
her-- and she realizes everyone is waiting for her to answer.

                            TIERNEY
             ...What?

                            HANNAH
             The ghosts.

                         TIERNEY
             Oh. I don't know...

But that's when Jenna pipes up.

                         JENNA
             I do. They talk to me now. Ever since
             I started drinking the ghost water.

Tierney frowns.

                            TIERNEY
             That's not--

                         RACHEL
             Me too. I hear them.

                         DENA
             So do I! It's part of my magic--

Finally Tierney has had enough.

                          TIERNEY
             Nobody hears them. Not even me.
                   (beat)
             Look, there's something I need to
             tell you. Something I need you to
             really hear. It's important. And--
             it's the truth.

She has them rapt. She takes a deep breath. This is it:

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             The ghosts aren't real. And neither
             is magic.

The other girls give a collective gasp. What Tierney's
saying is blasphemy. But she keeps going. She pulls an
algae-covered rock from her coat pocket and tosses it into
the center of the circle for all to see.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             It's the well water. The algae-- it's
             hemlock silt.
                         (MORE)
                                                           97.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             That's what's been making you see
             things and hear things and feel
             things that aren't real. It's poison.

The girls begin to murmur with unease.

                            JESSICA
             But--

                         TIERNEY
             And it's deliberate. We're made to
             think we have this power inside us to
             make us easier to control. We're made
             to think there are ghosts haunting
             these woods when really it's just
             men. Men our own County have bought
             and paid to slaughter us if we step
             out of line. I know because I met
             one-- out there in the forest. He
             found me, took care of me. He's the
             reason I stayed alive.

And now Tierney reveals-- the SHROUD she carries with her.

Gertrude's face twists with revulsion. Shock. Horror. And
she's not alone. Tierney's words are hitting home. Until--

Kiersten stands up. No more lying in wait. She's finally
making her move.

                            KIERSTEN
             She's lying.

                         TIERNEY
             No, I'm not--

                         KIERSTEN
             Men or ghosts, it doesn't matter. The
             magic is real. We've all felt it. And
             I'm going to prove it. And when I do,
             we will cut out your heretic tongue
             once and for all.

Kiersten gets up and strides toward the gate. The other
girls quickly follow. She yanks open the gate and steps over
the threshold into the forest.

                         JENNA
             What are you doing?!

                         KIERSTEN
             It's fine. No harm will come to me.
             Watch.
                                                           98.


Kiersten keeps going. Gaining confidence with every stride.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             Nothing can touch me. My magic
             forbids it. Join me and you'll see.

Jenna and Jessica tentatively step over the threshold...

When a FIGURE appears steps out of the brush up ahead.

A POACHER. Anders.

The other girls freeze. They rush back into the Encampment.
But Kiersten just laughs.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             Don't worry. If it's just a man under
             that shroud as Tierney claims, he'll
             be powerless to act against my will.

Kiersten takes another step forward. As if taunting him.

Anders stands there, considering. Then he draws a knife. And
strides toward her.

Tierney pushes her way to the front.

                            TIERNEY
             Kiersten...

Kiersten's smile begins to waver, but she stands her ground.

                         KIERSTEN
             That's as close as my magic will
             allow. Watch.

But Anders keeps coming. And TWO MORE POACHERS emerge from
the brush, flanking him.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             Stop. I command you.

                         TIERNEY
             Kiersten-- run!

Kiersten turns to look back at the Encampment-- a glimmer of
real FEAR in her eyes. But--

Other girls SHRIEK as TWO MORE POACHERS emerge from around
the sides of the Encampment. Forming a circle. Knives drawn.

                            KIERSTEN
             I said stop!
                                                          99.


But they keep closing in. And we watch Kiersten's face as--

Realization finally washes over her. And with it... terror.

                         TIERNEY
             We need to help her! We need to-- do
             something!

But the other girls are frozen in fear. Tierney spies THE
AXE near the door. She grabs it and CHARGES out SWINGING--

The Poachers hesitate. Giving her a wide berth. Allowing her
to catch up with Kiersten--

Before they close ranks again. Now Tierney is trapped in the
middle too. Kiersten looks at her, trembling.

                         KIERSTEN
             I don't understand...

Tierney raises the axe. Bracing for a fight.

For a moment, she LOCKS EYES with one of the Poachers in the
circle. It's Ryker-- looking frantic and terrified. What are
they supposed to do now??

Slowly, calmly, Ryker steps into the circle.

                         ANDERS
             What are you doing?!

                         RYKER
             Listen to me. There is no magic. It's
             all a lie. They're just girls.
             They're sick and they're scared, but
             they aren't dangerous. I promise.

The Poachers pause. Taking this in. For a moment, it seems
like they might actually stand down...

And then ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.

A Poacher LUNGES at Tierney-- his blade slices into
Tierney's heavy COAT and--

THWACK! Ryker strikes-- burying his blade in the Poacher's
back. The Poacher stumbles forward, gurgling blood.

Anders and the others gape at Ryker with shock.

Ryker turns to Tierney-- a hundred emotions stirring in
those dark eyes.
                                                           100.


                         RYKER (cont'd)
             Run.

                         TIERNEY
             No--!

Too late. Anders and the Poachers turn on Ryker. Swarming
him. He draws a pair of blades to meet their attack...

But the odds are against him. The Poachers' blades flash and
Ryker disappears from view. Swallowed up by their shrouds.

Kiersten cowers behind Tierney and her axe as Tierney howls--

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             Stop it!!

But they don't stop. Not until it's over.

The Poachers step away. There's blood on their blades, blood
on their shrouds, and Ryker's body broken on the ground.

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             You killed him. How could you?! He
             was one of you!

The Poachers stagger back. Dazed. One of them pulls off his
shroud and VOMITS on the ground. And with his face revealed
we see-- he's just a boy.

Then they all remove their shrouds. Facing the terrible
truth of what they've done...

But then Anders's face twists into a SNEER. Pointing his
bloody blade at Tierney and Kiersten.

                         ANDERS
             No. No-- you did this.

Kiersten huddles against Tierney, who stares back at Anders
defiantly. Clearly just two scared, defenseless girls.

And finally-- one of the other Poachers forces his arm down.

                         ANDERS
             It's not our fault! They made us do it.
             With their magic. We had no choice!

But the other Poachers lead him away. Slinking back into the
forest in shame.

And Tierney leads Kiersten back to...
                                                          101.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS

Jenna and Jessica rush to Kiersten, who is a sniveling,
trembling mess. Utterly broken.

                         KIERSTEN
             It was all... a lie...?

Tierney is in shock. Her ears RING, her vision BLURS.
Everything is a haze...

She drops the axe. Feeling lost and alone and utterly
hopeless. Everything has gone so terribly wrong...

The other girls stand there in stunned silence. Their entire
worldview has just been shattered. Ghosts aren't real. Magic
isn't real. Everything they've been taught is a lie. Where
can they possibly go from here...?

                           GERTRUDE
             Your coat.

Tierney looks down at the long GASH in her heavy winter
coat. A blow that surely would have killed her. She touches
the hole-- and frowns. Feeling something unexpected...

A SEED. She rolls it between her fingers. A memory forming--

                         TIERNEY
             The lining...

                         KIERSTEN
             Tierney. What are we supposed to do?

And that's when Tierney realizes-- ALL THE GIRLS are looking
at her. Desperate for guidance. For a leader.

And we see the shifting expression on Tierney's face:

Resignation. That she will never escape and start over with
a new life. And then... Resolve.

Tierney sloughs off her coat. She grabs the torn fabric in
the side and RIPS--

DOZENS OF SEEDS spill out onto the earth.

Tierney stands tall. Strong. Determined. Confident.

                           TIERNEY
             We survive.
              102.

EXT. FOREST - ESTABLISHING

A crisp wind moves through the trees, rustling leaves. Trees
are covered in vibrant red-orange leaves.

We push in on the Encampment...


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS

And it is a world transformed.

An elaborate IRRIGATION SYSTEM of tree bark pipes channels
fresh water into the camp.

There's a new wash station with VEILS used as netting. A
covered area for cooking.

The well has been boarded over, the word POISON scorched
into the planks for good measure.

Trees in the back of the camp have been cut and cleared to
make room for a massive garden. Pumpkins. Tomatoes. Celery.
Carrots. Potatoes. Peas.

In the lodge house, the beds are set in a circle with clean
sheets and newly sewn-and-stuffed mattresses.

And THE GIRLS themselves are healthy and strong-- and hard
at work. Cleaning the privy. Organizing the larder. Washing
clothes and picking vegetables and cooking a feast.

They work hand in hand, side by side, helping each other as
they go. Even Kiersten is hard at work.


INT. LARDER - SAME

Tierney carefully places a folded piece of paper just so on
a shelf. It looks like a note.

Then she closes the cupboard door and makes her way out...


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS

Tierney stands there, taking it all in. We see that she's
still wearing her (mended) coat, despite the heat.

Gertrude approaches. Her hair has started growing back,
covering the scar from her wound.
                                                           104.


                         GERTRUDE
             The privy's been scrubbed and the
             mattresses freshened. There's a full
             cord of firewood stacked next to the
             lodge house. I'd say we've set the
             next girls up for success.

                         TIERNEY
             Just one thing left to do.

Gertrude follows her gaze over to... The Punishment Tree.


THWACK!

Hannah drives the axe deep into the base of the Punishment
Tree. Then she pries the axe free and turns to--

A line of girls each waiting for their turn.

THWACK! One by one, the girls each take a swing.

THWACK! Channeling all their sadness and rage and guilt.

THWACK! Braids, toes, fingers, teeth rattling until--

THWACK! The Punishment Tree falls to the ground.


EXT. ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

The gnarled limbs of the Punishment Tree burn in the bonfire.
The girls gather around the flames. Their hair flowing. Their
bare feet against soft grass.

Happy. Harmonious. Free.

Snug in her coat, Tierney smiles to herself. And for just a
moment, the scene TRANSFORMS INTO--


TIERNEY'S VISION

The crackling flames of a BONFIRE in the middle of a forest.
WOMEN dancing around it, all wild hair and billowing dresses
and twisting arms...


BACK TO REALITY

But Tierney shakes her head, and the vision fades as--
Gertrude approaches, standing beside her.
                                                     105.


                         GERTRUDE
             Feeling alright?

                         TIERNEY
             I was just... thinking. About
             everything we've built here. All of
             us, together. I want to believe that
             it matters. That it happened this way
             for a reason. I have to believe that.

                         GERTRUDE
                   (grimaces)
             Don't do that. Don't pretend that
             this is fate. That it's fair.

                         TIERNEY
             Should I be angry instead? Scared?
             Wallowing in self-pity all the way to
             the gallows? I won't give them that
             satisfaction.

Gertrude looks at Tierney now. Fighting tears.

                         GERTRUDE
             There must be something you can do.

                         TIERNEY
             There is. I can tell the truth. I can
             look them in the eyes and tell them
             all what the Grace Year really is. At
             least that way, my death will mean
             something.

                         GERTRUDE
                   (pointed)
             But it's not just about you anymore.

Tierney holds her gaze. Just as pointed.

                         TIERNEY
             You're right. It's about all of us.
             And Ryker. And all the girls who
             walked the path before us and will
             walk it long after we're gone.

Gertrude sniffs. Quietly contemplative.

                         GERTRUDE
             I wish... we could just stay here.

Tierney gazes out at the scene before them.
                                                          106.


                          TIERNEY
             Do you know what I see, when I look
             at these girls? Strength. Warmth.
             Peace. Radiating out of every single
             one of them.

                         GERTRUDE
             You've been drinking from the well.

                         TIERNEY
             Imagine if you were able to let that
             light shine, all of you together, how
             bright the world could be.

Gertrude smiles, imagining. It's a nice thought. Even though
they both know it's not that simple.

They watching the flames together. And across the fire...

Kiersten is watching them. Her expression inscrutable.

We PAN UP to the night sky, filled with stars...

And before our eyes the night turns to... DAWN.


EXT. FOREST - DAWN

The Tall and Short Guards trudge to the Encampment's gate.
They start to knock, but--

The gate swings open wide, and the girls file out:

One at a time. Hair braided. Clothes clean. Shoes polished.
Eyes downcast. Lips sealed.

The guards trade a look, surprised. This is... unusual.

They do a head count.

                         TALL GUARD
             Fifteen? Is that it?

                         SHORT GUARD
                   (nervous)
             Strong magic this year.


EXT. LAKE - DAY

The girls climb into the waiting canoes. They disperse among
the four boats... so much room between them this time.
                                                           107.


Tierney, bundled in her coat, sweats under the sun. The
Short Guard notices.

                           SHORT GUARD
             Warm today.

Tierney doesn't answer. She hugs her mother's coat tighter
around her. Bulkier than usual.


EXT. FOREST - DAY

The girls walk. Following the well-worn path. Tierney is
sweating profusely now. Breath heaving as she stumbles
along. A panic attack...?

She pauses to catch her breath--

But a guard roughly shoves her forward. She almost falls,
but Gertrude is there to steady her.

                         GUARD
             Keep moving. Go on.

She keeps staggering along. One foot in front of the other.
Until they reach--


THE GATES

Looming up ahead. This is it.

The church bell tolls, announcing their return. The gates
open and

THE NEW GRACE YEAR GIRLS

funnel out in a prim little line, all dressed up like dolls.

They stare, wide-eyed, as they pass Tierney and her group.
Fearful and naive and not at all prepared for what awaits
them.

Without warning, Tierney REACHES OUT to one of the new girls
and GRASPS her arm. The girl GASPS, tries to recoil-- But
Tierney holds her fast.

                         TIERNEY
                   (low)
             It's going to be alright--

But then the Guards are on her, forcing her back in line.
                                                           108.


                         TALL GUARD
             That's enough. Keep moving.

The new girl keeps going, shaken. And Tierney falls back in
line as they pass through the gate into--


EXT. TOWN - CONTINUOUS

They head for the square. The whole town has gathered.
Everyone is waiting to see which girls made it. Families
cheer with relief or wail with disappointment.

Tierney spots her family in the crowd. Penny. Clara. Her
father. But she can't bring herself to smile at them.

The men and boys who offered a veil stand in a row in the
center of the square, each holding a black ribbon.

Tierney and the girls line up to face them... And Tierney
finds herself face to face with MICHAEL. He looks so
earnest. And hopeful. And relieved.

Beside her, Gertrude scans the crowd, confused.

                         GERTRUDE
             Where is... Geezer Fallow?

Indeed, there is an empty space across from her. They see
Mr. Welk approaching. He stops in front of Gertrude. Leaning
in, speaking low...

Gertrude gasps. She sinks down to her knees. Murmurs ripple
through the line of Grace Year girls...

When Mr. Welk leaves, Gertrude looks over at Tierney, a
smile behind her hand as she feigns grief for the crowd.

                         GERTRUDE (cont'd)
             He's dead. He passed this winter.
             They're sending me to the fields...

                         TIERNEY
             See? Everything as it should be--

                         MICHAEL
             Tierney!

Suddenly Michael is there. He's broken formation to greet
her. Wrapping his arms around her...

                         MICHAEL
             I couldn't wait--
                                                           109.


But he freezes. His arms drop. He staggers back. Confused.

                         MICHAEL (cont'd)
             What...?

Mr. Welk notices. Sensing something is off. He starts to
approach...

And Tierney realizes-- this is it. She's run out of time.
Just like Michael, always ruining her plans.

She steps forward. She unbuttons her heavy coat and lets it
fall to the ground.

Gasps of shock. Cries of outrage. Michael RECOILS. Because--

Tierney is visibly pregnant.

Her hands are shaking as she raises her chin to face the
crowd. For all her bravado, she is terrified.

                         TIERNEY
                   (voice trembling)
             There's something... I want to say--

But her voice is quickly drowned out by the condemnation of
the crowd. Tierney's Father looks ill. Her sisters look
stricken. And Michael looks utterly heartbroken.

Mr. Welk steps to Michael's side.

                         MR. WELK
             Guards!

In moments two guards grab Tierney by the arms.

                         MR. WELK (cont'd)
             Never in all my years has a crime
             been so apparent. Get her out of our
             sight.

And before she can speak, the guards drag her away.


INT. CELL - NIGHT

Tierney sits on a cold dank floor behind a row of metal
bars. Head bowed. Hands resting on her heaving belly.
Resigned to her fate.

A door screeches open. Footsteps echo in. And someone
approaches her cell. Michael.
                                                          110.


Tierney struggles to stand up--

                         MICHAEL
             Don't. Please.

He looks utterly miserable.

                          MICHAEL (cont'd)
             Tell me... you were taken... against
             your will...

Tierney holds his gaze.

                          TIERNEY
             I wasn't.

His face twists, new anger burning in his eyes. He spits the
words out like they're bitter to taste--

                         MICHAEL
             How could you-- betray me--?

And Tierney's own anger comes flaring back--

                         TIERNEY
             How could I? How could you?! You knew
             I didn't want to be a wife!

                         MICHAEL
             So you did this, what? Out of spite?

                         TIERNEY
             No. It wasn't about you at all. It
             was about me.

Michael glares.

                         MICHAEL
             Who is he? One of the guards...?

                         TIERNEY
             He was a Poacher.

                          MICHAEL
             A what?

Tierney studies his face, but Michael appears genuinely
confused. He doesn't know the truth about this place.

                         TIERNEY
             Ask your Father.
                                                        111.


                         MICHAEL
             Do you... do you love him?

Tierney looks away.

                         TIERNEY
             It doesn't matter. He's dead.

And at that, Michael finally brightens.

                         MICHAEL
             Then lie. Tell the Council this man
             forced himself on you. Or-- or your
             magic made you do it. They'll show
             compassion, I know they will--
                   (off her reaction)
             Tierney, you're going to hang.

Tierney doesn't answer.

                         MICHAEL (cont'd)
             What's wrong with you? The Tierney I
             know is a fighter, not a martyr.

And at that, Tierney laughs. Bitter and cynical.

                          TIERNEY
             The Tierney you know? You have no
             idea what I've been through. The
             things I've seen... the things I've
             done... You don't even know what's
             happening in this County, right here
             under your nose.
                   (cold)
             The Tierney you know died out there
             in the forest. You don't know me at
             all anymore.

Michael wilts. No idea what to say to that.

                         MICHAEL
             Maybe I don't.

And with that, Michael slinks out.

Tierney slumps back. Leaning her head against the wall. A
shadow falls across the floor--

                         TIERNEY
             I have nothing else to say to you...

But it's not Michael. It's a new visitor: Her Father.
                                                           112.


                         ABE
             My little Tierney...

Emotion floods through her. Shame... fear... betrayal...

                         TIERNEY
             Don't.

                         ABE
             I'm so sorry. I thought... I could
             keep you safe.

                         TIERNEY
             By lying to me? For my entire life?

                         ABE
                   (winces)
             Whatever you think I--

But she's been bottling this resentment for too long--

                         TIERNEY
             I don't think. I know. About all of
             it-- the Poachers, the Outskirts
             Village, the hemlock silt.

                         ABE
             Hemlock silt...?

                         TIERNEY
             I know there's no such thing as
             magic. The only thing I don't
             understand is how you live with
             yourself. Knowing you condemned an
             innocent woman to die.

                         ABE
             You think that was easy for me?! You
             think I don't feel that weight every
             second of every day? I loved your
             mother more than anything in this
             world. But I had no choice.

                         TIERNEY
             I don't believe you.

                         ABE
             Then you've forgotten. Or repressed
             it. The real reason your mother died.

He reaches through the bars and places something on the
floor of her cell--
                                                           113.


A tiny, red flower. Just like the ones growing in the
Outskirts Village. Just like the flowers that fell from the
Woman's hand in her dream...

                         ABE (cont'd)
             Think, Tierney. Remember...

Tierney looks at the flower. And suddenly-- it hits her.
Like a lightning strike...


INT. TIERNEY'S HOME - NIGHT - PAST

YOUNG TIERNEY startles awake in the middle of the night. Her
other sisters still asleep beside her.

She gets up and goes to the window, where she sees--

A FIGURE slipping away from the house...


EXT. FOREST - NIGHT - PAST

Tierney stumbles through the trees. Up ahead-- A light.
Shifting, stretching, dancing with a fluid grace.

A BONFIRE.

Around it-- movement. Figures forming a circle. Tierney
moves into the clearing to find--

Women. Their hair loose and wild, their dresses unbuttoned
and unlaced, their feet bare on soft ground that is
blanketed with tiny red flowers. And one of them is--

The Woman from her dreams. But there is nothing frightening
or sinister about her. She radiates joy and love.

                         YOUNG TIERNEY
             Mommy?

Her Mother spots her. Lifts her up and nuzzles her. And then
they see--

A different kind of light shining through the trees. And
another. And another. Orbs of light floating in the
darkness, completely surrounding them:

Lanterns. They've been caught.
                                                           114.


INT. CELL - NIGHT

Tierney sits. Holding the red flower. Tears in her eyes.

Her dream was never a vision of the future... It was a
memory from the past.

                         TIERNEY
             She was... fighting back.

Abe sighs. He suddenly seems very old and very tired.

                         ABE
             And she was caught. And she knew
             there was no way she could save
             herself. But if she took the blame--
             if she said she bewitched the others
             with her magic-- she could save the
             movement.

OFF TIERNEY: A new memory rushing back to her. One she's
repressed for so long, it turned into a nightmare...


EXT. TOWN - SUNRISE - PAST

We're knee-high in a crowd of people. Scanning faces,
desperately searching--

We push through to the front-- to see THE WOMAN standing on
a rolling staircase under the Punishment Tree with a noose
around her neck. And now we know-- it's TIERNEY'S MOTHER.

A group of men stand at the base of the tree-- THE COUNCIL.
Tierney's Father, ten years younger, joins them. The Head of
the Council, MR. WELK (Michael's Father) addresses the crowd.

                         MR. WELK
             Ruth James. You stand accused of
             harboring your magic. Your own husband
             confirms it. Do you deny it?

Tierney's Mother stares out at the crowd. Her face is stone.

                         TIERNEY'S MOTHER
             I do not.

Murmurs ripple through the crowd. Tierney's Father looks like
he's going to be sick.
                                                          115.


                         MR. WELK
             So be it. Ruth James, on behalf of God
             and the chosen men, I hereby sentence
             you to--

But Tierney's Mother doesn't wait. She shocks them all by
stepping off the ledge.

The rope pulls taut. Her neck snaps. Her body convulses. And
her hands fall open to reveal--

A TINY RED FLOWER in one palm. It falls drops to the ground
beneath her feet.


INT. CELL - NIGHT

Tierney looks at her father with a new kind of fury.

                         TIERNEY
             You accused her.

And he looks at her with anguish.

                         ABE
             And for that I will never forgive
             myself. But I made her a promise.
             That I would protect what she
             started. And pick up where she left
             off. And keep you girls safe.

                         TIERNEY
             You should have told me...

                         ABE
             I was afraid. I'd already lost her, I
             couldn't bear to lose you, too. I
             thought, once you returned from the
             Grace Year...
                   (ashamed)
             I'm sorry. I'm sorry-- for all of it.
             I tried to protect you, prepare you.
             ...But I've failed you. In every way.

They lean their heads together on opposite sides of the
bars. The weight of the world between them.

                         ABE (cont'd)
             Hemlock silt. In the Encampment?

                         TIERNEY
             In the well. We were drinking it by
             the cupful every day.
                                                           116.


                         ABE
                   (stunned)
             Then it's all a lie. There is no
             magic. There's no reason for... any
             of this.

But Tierney is off on her own tangent...

                         TIERNEY
             All this time, I was so afraid of
             her. Of becoming like her. And yet
             here I am. Just like her in the end.

Abe looks at her, a new kind of pain in his eyes.

                         ABE
             No. Your mother gave her life for
             this cause, and I supported her. But
             please. Don't ask me to do it again.
             The last thing we need is another
             martyr.

But Tierney stares back at him defiantly. And here in this
moment, she looks so much like her mother.

                         TIERNEY
             What would you have me do? You want
             me to live with their lie?

                         ABE
             Not live with it, no. Use it...

PRE-LAP: the steady beat of a drum as--


EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

The town is gathered to watch as Guards lead Tierney to:

THE PUNISHMENT TREE. A noose hangs from its thickest branch,
the gallows below.

They force her up the steps, tighten the noose around her
neck. She's just like her mother, looking down on the crowd.

The Council in the first row. The Grace Year girls scattered
throughout the crowd, standing with their families, or their
new husbands, or their respective labor houses.

And there is her Father. He's left Penny and Clara at home.

Mr. Welk steps forward. Michael at his side.

                         MR. WELK
             Tierney James. You stand accused of
             depravity, debauchery, and
             fornication. What do you have to say
             for yourself?

The Grace Year girls are looking up at her with bated
breath, full of dread and awe...

But Tierney looks calm. Controlled. No trace of the fear
that gripped her yesterday.

                         TIERNEY
             I only have one thing to say. And
             that's-- the truth.

So much for her Father's plea...?

She looks at the other Grace Year girls. At Michael. At her
Father. The men of the Council. The faces in the crowd...

And she gives a little GASP of surprise as she notices--

Everywhere, all throughout the crowd, are flashes of red:

A tiny red flower under one woman's apron bib. Beneath the
ruffle of a dress. Pinned to a collar. Threaded in a braid.
Tucked behind an ear.

It is a red wave. A united front of silent, secret
solidarity. And it is proof--

That Tierney is not alone in this fight. Her mother's
revolution lives on.

And she's ready to join it. She takes a deep breath:

                         TIERNEY (cont'd)
             It's Michael's baby.

The crowd murmurs. Her Father nods encouragement. (Aha,
she's taking his advice after all.) Michael frowns. Mr. Welk
just laughs.

                         MR. WELK
             Michael hasn't set foot outside the
             county all year.

                         TIERNEY
             I came to him in a dream, night after
             night. That was my magic.
                                                          118.


More rumbles from the crowd. It's working! She might just be
winning them over. But then--

KIERSTEN steps forward in the crowd. Oh no...

                         KIERSTEN
             I have something to say, if the
             Council will allow it.

Tierney's heart sinks. This girl has spent an entire year
plotting to destroy her. And now she finally has her chance.

Mr. Welk brightens. He knows Kiersten has more ill-will
toward Tierney than anyone. He gestures for her to continue.

Kiersten looks up at Tierney with cold, hard eyes. They both
know Tierney's life is in her hands. And then--

She turns to address the crowd.

                         KIERSTEN (cont'd)
             What Tierney says is true. We all
             witnessed it. The baby is Michael's.

Tierney is stunned. What...? But Kiersten glances back at
her-- with that little spark in her eye. They share a common
enemy far greater than their own rivalry.

                         MR. WELK
                   (incredulous)
             You don't expect us to believe that--

But then Gertrude steps forward.

                         GERTRUDE
             She had the strongest magic of all of
             us.

The other girls step forward now. All vouching for Tierney.

Tierney now turns her gaze to Michael. Challenging him.
Imploring him. He looks up at her-- pain and anger and
humiliation etched across his face...

                         MR. WELK
             Enough of this. Tierney James, on
             behalf of God and the chosen men--

But Michael turns away from his Father, to the crowd--

                         MICHAEL
             Yes. The child is mine. I commanded
             her to do it.

                         MICHAEL (cont'd)
             I didn't want to wait an entire year.
             If you need to punish someone, punish
             me.
                   (to Tierney)
             I was selfish. And I'm sorry.

It's a genuine apology. A glimpse of the boy she knew
before. And a promise of the man he'll be in the future.

                         MR. WELK
             Michael, don't be a fool...

                          TIERNEY
             Are you calling us liars? All of us?
             My magic was powerful, Mr. Welk. Just
             like my mother's. And if you don't
             believe that, maybe you'd like to
             explain why.

There it is. The threat. Let her live; or reveal the truth.

Mr. Welk stares Tierney dead in the eyes. Hatred pouring out
of him. But there's a deeper emotion behind it as well.
Fear. The fear that he might be losing control.

He's in a no-win situation. And they both know it.

And that makes Mr. Welk FURIOUS. With a ROAR, he CHARGES the
gallows-- SHOVING it aside--

Tierney PLUMMETS-- The rope pulls TAUT-- The crowd GASPS--

                          MICHAEL
             Tierney--!

And yet...

Tierney lives. As fourteen pairs of hands hold her up.

The Grace Year girls stand together. Supporting her.
Protecting her. A show of solidarity unlike anything this
town has ever seen. Tierney is an outsider no more.

They remove the noose from her neck; help her to her feet.

Mr. Welk moves toward her-- but Michael intervenes.

                         MICHAEL (cont'd)
             Careful, Father. That's my wife.

Michael gives Tierney a nod. A gesture of support. He is
here for her, no matter what.

Mr. Welk looks past them all to Tierney. He growls low:

                         MR. WELK
             This isn't over.

Tierney holds his gaze, and then bows her head demurely. She
will play this game... and she will win.

Tierney moves into the crowd. The other Grace Year girls
following behind her. And now we PAN OUT--

Past the town...

                         TIERNEY (V.O.)
             They're right to fear us.

Into the forest...

                         TIERNEY (V.O.) (cont'd)
             We are dangerous. We are powerful.

Across the river...

                         TIERNEY (V.O.) (cont'd)
             And it has nothing to do with magic.

And into the Encampment...

                         TIERNEY (V.O.) (cont'd)
             Our strength lies in each other.


INT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS

...where the new group of Grace Year Girls are crowded
around the larder, reading the NOTE that Tierney left them:

                         TIERNEY (V.O.)
             The Grace Year was meant to break us,
             but you can take it back. Let it be
             your sanctuary. Your shelter. And
             your proving ground. And when you
             return-- you too can join the fight.

The girls look at each other. Revolution brewing in their
eyes. And just beyond them, at their feet--

A tiny RED FLOWER is poking up through the grass.

                                              FADE TO BLACK.
