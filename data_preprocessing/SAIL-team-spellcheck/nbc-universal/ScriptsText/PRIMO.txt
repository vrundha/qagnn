                              COLD OPEN

INT. RAFA’S BEDROOM - MID-MORNING - SATURDAY

RAFA (16, sweet, nervous, well-intentioned) is in his small,
messy room, laying in bed, scrolling through Instagram.
There’s a blanket hung up in front of the window to keep the
light out. It’s quiet and peaceful. Rafa gets a text from
MIGUEL, one of his friends (words appear on screen).

                    MIGUEL
              (via text)
          Yo is ur mom cooking?

Rafa squints his eyes, tries to sense if his mom is making
breakfast. He catches a food smell in the air. He texts back.

                       RAFA
                 (via text)
          Yeah

          What happened w/Mya? Did u ask her out?

          No. I got too nervous.

                    MIGUEL
          When u ask her out r u gonna do what ur
          Uncle Rick said to do lol

EXT. RAFA’S FRONT PORCH - A WEEK AGO - FLASHBACK

Rafa and UNCLE RICK (35, bald, tattooed, wild man).

                    UNCLE RICK
          If you like a girl, you ask her out on a
          date to the movies at night. Then, when
          the movie’s over...you leave without
          telling her.

                       RAFA
          ...What?

                    UNCLE RICK
          Abandon her there. You have to find out
          early on if she’s resourceful. You want a
          resourceful woman.

          Can you get me another beer? I don’t

Off Rafa --

BACK TO PRESENT

Rafa texts back --

                    RAFA
              (via text)
          Probably not.

                    ANGELA (O.S.)
          Rafa! Time to get moving!

He walks to his bedroom door, then takes a deep breath, like
he’s about to dive off a 10-meter platform. He opens it --

INT. RAFA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

-- and it’s like he’s been dropped into Times Square.
Everything goes from quiet and peaceful and dark to kinetic
and chaotic and loud. (Shot as a single unbroken take.)

ANGELA (34, whip-smart, always a step ahead of you) buzzes
past him, doing laundry.

                    ANGELA
          Hurry up and get some food before your
          uncles eat it all.

                    RAFA
          Okay mom. Just gotta go to the--

Rafa opens the bathroom door, but Uncle Rick jumps past him --

                    RAFA (CONT’D)
              (frustrated)
          Uncle Rick, c’mon!

                    UNCLE RICK (O.S.)
              (through the door)
          Too slow.

                    RAFA
          What are you talking about “too slow?” I
          was here first.

                    UNCLE RICK (O.S.)
          Too fast then.

          long are you gonna be in there?

                     UNCLE RICK (O.S.)
          Hard to say. We’re all just slaves to our
          buttholes.

Rafa, grossed out, walks away.

                    UNCLE RICK (O.S.) (CONT’D)
          How did it go with that girl? Did you do
          what I said? Did she make it home okay?

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Rafa walks into the kitchen. UNCLE MATT (31, short, muscular,
ex-military) and UNCLE MANUEL (36, artistic, slight hippie
vibe) are wolfing down breakfast and loudly arguing --

                    UNCLE MANUEL
          Are you nuts? It’s an American classic!

                    UNCLE MATT
          I’m sorry, Toy Story 3 was awful. Lots-O’-
          Huggin’ Bear’s counterinsurgency measures
          were remedial, at best.

                    UNCLE MANUEL
          “Counterinsurgency measures”? It’s a
          movie about talking toys. Everything’s
          not the military, Matt.
              (sees Rafa)
          Rafa, settle an argument. Your Uncle Matt
          thinks Toy Story 3 was bad because of
          the...lackluster warfare, I guess. I say
          it was great. Who’s right?

Angela comes buzzing back through --

                    RAFA
          Ma, Uncle Matt and Uncle Manuel ate all
          the breakfast.

                    ANGELA
          There’s more coming. I have to go meet
          with someone before work.

                    RAFA
          Who? About what?

She gives him a look: “do not ask me questions like that.”

                    RAFA
          It came out like 10 years ago. How are
          y’all just now seeing it?

                    UNCLE MATT
              (to Rafa)
          Hey, what ended up happening with that
          girl? Did you take my advice?

Off Rafa’s face --

EXT. PARK - THREE DAYS AGO - FLASHBACK

Rafa, Uncle Matt, and Uncle Manuel sit at a table. The other
uncles and Angela are in the b.g. barbecuing and talking.

                    UNCLE MATT
          Primo: if you wanna impress a girl, you
          have to show her how strong you are.

                    UNCLE MANUEL
          Or how tall you are. But Matt can’t do
          that, so he goes for “strong.”

                    UNCLE MATT
          Every first date I go on, I figure out a
          way to do push-ups in front of the girl.

                    UNCLE MANUEL
          That’s why he never has a second date.
          That and the fact that he’s 3 feet tall.

Matt attacks him and they start WRESTLING--

BACK TO SCENE

Rafa walks into the front room. UNCLE BRIAN (29, low-grade
corporate) walks in, wearing a SUIT.

                    UNCLE BRIAN
          Oh hey Rafa. You’re probably wondering,
          and yeah, it is a new suit. My job kind
          of requires that I look nice, so...

                    RAFA
              (confused)
          ...Do you think I said something?

          Oh yeah -- y’all only have one bathroom.
          I always forget that. My house has two
          bathrooms. That’s probably why.

Rafa sighs -- he’s heard this “brag” before. The front door
opens. It’s UNCLE JESSE (35, small business owner, self-
reliant), yelling to everyone and no one before he’s even in
the house, because Uncle Jesse is a goddamn tornado--

                    UNCLE JESSE
          Terry’s sick! We’re short a man, and I
          got four irrigation systems to install.
          Which one of y’all is coming to work with
          me today?

Angela walks toward the table and sets a plate of food down.

                    ANGELA
          Stop being so loud, Jesse.
              (calling off)
          Rafa! Breakfast! I’m going to work.

She leaves. Uncle Jesse picks up the plate and starts eating.

                    UNCLE JESSE
              (sees Rafa)
          Primo! How’d it go with the girl?!

Uncle Rick enters --

                    RICK
          Oh good, more food!

He starts eating. Rafa’s phone buzzes -- it’s Miguel again.

                    MIGUEL
              (via text)
          Wait. Who’s over there? How many uncles?

Rafa watched Brian, Jesse, Rick, Matt and Manuel all bicker
and laugh and fight and squabble.

                            ACT ONE

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GUIDANCE COUNSELOR’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Rafa sits across from BETSY, his guidance counselor, and
forces an uneasy smile (not sure whether he’s in trouble).

                    RAFA
          Before you start, can I just say that
          whatever you think I did, I didn’t do it,
          or if I did, I didn’t mean to, or if I
          did mean to, I didn’t know it was wrong --

                    BETSY
              (interrupting)
          Mr. Gonzales, where do you think you
          might want to go to college?

Rafa is caught off-guard.

                    RAFA
          ...I’m sorry?

                    BETSY
          College. Surely you’ve thought about it.
          I know I have.

                    RAFA
              (confused)
          You haven’t gone to college yet?

                    BETSY
          ...I meant for you.

She hands him a FORM.

                    BETSY (CONT'D)
          There’s a college prep program here that
          I’d like you to join. It helps our junior-
          year students prepare for the college
          application process. It’s an hour after
          school, once a week. Just sign that form,
          and you’re in.

                    RAFA
          I don’t think that’s for me. I’m probably
          not... right for college.

                    BETSY
          What does that mean? “Not right.”

                    RAFA
              (smiles)
          Come on. We both know that I... come on.

She looks at him for a beat, then hands him a manila folder.
Inside are test results.

          Do you know what that is?

                    RAFA
          ...No, but it’s definitely good news.
          There’s a lot of green here.

                    BETSY
              (curious)
          Does that matter?

                    RAFA
          Yes. If you get a thing from a teacher in
          school and it has a lot of green on it,
          then that’s usually good for you. Red is
          usually bad. So whatever this is, I
          probably did good on it.

She smiles. Camera slowly PUSHES IN on Rafa as she talks.

                    BETSY
          Those are the results from the
          standardized test you and your classmates
          took at the end of your sophomore year.
          You scored in the 93rd percentile. That
          means you scored higher than 92 percent
          of all the other sophomores in the state
          of Texas.
              (leans in)
          You’re telling me you’re not right for
          college, Mr. Gonzales. I’m telling you
          you’re exactly right for college. And
          that paper you’re holding proves it.

Rafa looks excited, maybe a little scared...

EXT. STREET - LATER

Rafa walks along with his friends (MIGUEL, MYA, and HARRIS).
They’re all 16. Mya is African-American, and more self-
assured than Rafa. Harris is looking at Rafa’s test results.

                    HARRIS
          Yo! You’re a genius!

                    RAFA
          No I’m not. I just did well on one test.
          Now the guidance counselor wants me to
          take this college prep program class.
          Did y’all know about that?

          I’ll be joining the college prep program.

          She told me about it. All the new
          students had to meet with her, and she
          brought it up. She kept calling me “Ms.
          Jones.” Made me feel like a grandma.

                    HARRIS
          College could be cool.

                    MIGUEL
          Yeah, maybe. I’ve always wanted to
          remodel an old house. That might be fun.
              (off their confusion)
          In the movies, if there’s a college part
          in it or whatever, there’s always a scene
          where the friends get together and fix up
          some old house. They’re all painting real
          fast, somebody squirts someone else with
          a hose, another person falls off a small
          ladder into a bush. Seems fun.

                    RAFA
          You...you know that’s not what college
          is, right? That’s just painting. You
          don’t have to go to college to paint a
          house.

                    HARRIS
          No way I’m going to college. College is
          for white people, and maybe rich Asians.

                     MIGUEL

          No Mexican has ever gone to college.
          Ever.

          There’s no way that’s true.

                    MIGUEL
          Selena didn’t go to college. She didn’t
          go, so I’m not going.

                    MYA
          Man, Selena never got to restore an old

Rafa laughs, she smiles at him. They pass the store where

          Y’all give me a minute. I’ma say what’s
          up to my mom.

INT. CORNER STORE - CONTINUOUS

It’s not busy. Rafa sees Angela talking to a MAN. She’s
holding a medium-sized box and shaking his hand. She notices
Rafa, then says goodbye to the guy, who then leaves.

                    RAFA
          Who was that? Do I know him?

                    ANGELA
          He works at the grocery store.

                    RAFA
          What’d he give you? That box?

                    ANGELA
              (sharply)
          Did he give it to you or to me?

Rafa knows that tone. He stops his line of questioning.

                    ANGELA (CONT’D)
          How was school?

                    RAFA
          It was school. Just regular.

Her eyes flash a little, knowingly. She sees Mya in the b.g.

                    ANGELA
          Is that our new neighbor? Mya? The one
          you like?--

                    RAFA
              (quickly)
          OK bye I’m going to Harris’s house.

                    ANGELA
          I need you home tonight by seven.

                    RAFA
          Why?

She gives him a look. Same as the tone, Rafa recognizes it.

                    RAFA (CONT’D)
          Your looks are getting scarier every day.

          more to scare you. Be home by 7.

Rafa leaves the store. Angela opens the box the guy gave her
(we can’t see what’s inside) and smiles.

                    ANGELA (CONT’D)
              (to herself)
          Bang.

INT. RAFA’S HOUSE - 6:30 P.M.

Angela and the uncles are putting the finishing touches on a
surprise party for Rafa. There about 15 PEOPLE in attendance,
including Angela and the five uncles. Brian and Jesse are
hanging a BANNER we can’t read yet. Matt is sitting at the
table. Angela sets an all-white cake down on the table.

                    ANGELA
          Matt? This is your job.

She hands him a plastic baggie filled with blue icing, tears
a small piece of the corner off the bag, then squeezes it so
some of the icing comes out.

                    UNCLE MATT
          What am I supposed to do with this?

                    ANGELA
          Use it to write on the cake. Write:
          “Congratulations, Rafa!” on there.

                    UNCLE RICK
          If you can’t see, I’ll get you a phone
          book to sit on.

Matt swipes at Rick.

                    ANGELA
              (to the room)
          And I need to talk to y’all about
          something. Listen up, dumb-dumbs!

All of the uncles stop what they’re doing and look at her.

                    ANGELA (CONT’D)
          Rafa’s guidance counselor called me a few
          weeks ago. She said he scored really well
          on some test, and she thinks he has a
          good chance at going to college when he
          graduates. He hasn’t said anything about
          it, but I know she met with him today.

          Because I’m smarter than all of you.

                    UNCLE JESSE
          It’s a mistake!

They all look at him.

                    UNCLE JESSE (CONT’D)
          He should be working. He’s 16 now! He’ll
          be 17 by the end of the school year, and
          soon he’ll be 18!

                    RICK
          Jesse’s right. That is how numbers work.

Manuel and Rick laugh. Jesse grits his teeth.

                    UNCLE JESSE
          I’m glad he’s gonna graduate high school.
          That’s great. But if Rafa starts working
          for me now, he’ll be ready to run his own
          crew by the time he graduates.

                    UNCLE BRIAN
          You’re an idiot.

                    UNCLE JESSE
          No, I’m a guy with a plan.

                    ANGELA
          This is exactly what I wanted to talk to
          you about. I don’t want y’all in his ear
          about this like y’all are with everything
          else. Nobody say a word to him about it.

Uncle Jesse begins to say something. Angela cuts him off.

                    ANGELA (CONT’D)
          Not a word. Leave him be.

She heads off. Jesse looks angry. Rick twists the knife.

                    UNCLE RICK
          Hey yo Jesse -- after Rafa is 18, what
          age does he turn next? Do you know?

          So you gonna do that class? Become a
          college boy?

                     RAFA
          Part of me wants to. Nobody in my family
          has ever been to college before. It’d be
          neat to be the first one. And my mom
          would freak. She’d be so happy.
              (then; realizing)
          But if I even bring it up, all my uncles
          are gonna be all over me about what I
          should do.

                    MYA
          “All” your uncles? How many do you have?

                    RAFA
          Five. Feels like 50 sometimes, though. My
          dad left when I was little, so the uncles
          are super protective of my mom and me.
          It’s weird. I have no dad but also five
          dads.

                    MYA
          Ha. What’s that like?

Rafa thinks.

                    RAFA
          Have you seen that movie Inside Out? Where
          the different emotions are all inside the
          girl’s head controlling her? It’s like
          that. Except but there’s cussing.

                    MYA
          That sounds kinda fun.

                    RAFA
          It’s very not. They’re everywhere! Always
          at my house, every morning and night...I
          even work part-time with my Uncle Jesse
          at his construction jobs, and all the
          other uncles are there sometimes.

                    MYA
              (chuckles)
          You work construction? How’s that go?

Off Rafa’s embarrassed grin.

We see Rafa struggling to dig a trench. He’s sweaty and
exhausted. Uncle Jesse walks by in the b.g.

          How’s it going bud?

                    RAFA
          Pretty good. Except my arms are on fire,
          and everything hurts, and I’m dying. How
          long have I been doing this?

Rafa and Mya are still walking.

          This one’s my house.

                    MYA
          Cool. Thanks for walking with me. I still
          don’t know the neighborhood that well.

                    RAFA
          Yeah, no problem. You’re only a couple
          houses away, so we can walk together.
          Anytime. If you want to go anywhere. For
          any reason. Or whatever.

She looks at him, confused. He blushes and averts his eyes.

          Yes. It’s just what my mom does. Every

          she throws a party.

--“Happy Subway Sandwich Punch Card Completion!”

Mya and Rafa.

                    MYA
          What’s Mad Men?

                    RAFA
          It’s a show that if you pretend to like
          it, people think you’re sophisticated.
          Uncle Brian made me watch it when he got
          a Netflix account.

          I actually have an announcement to make.

INT. - LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Uncle Jesse and Uncle Brian have pulled Rafa aside. Angela is
out of sight. Uncle Rick is in the b.g. drinking a beer.
Other people are around, but they’re mostly all keeping to
themselves. There’s an awkwardness in the air.

                    UNCLE JESSE
          Listen, I know you’re very excited right
          now. But college... it’s not the way to
          go. You should be working, contributing
          to the family, helping your mom.

                    UNCLE BRIAN
          It absolutely is the way to go. Education
          is crucial. Look at me -- I went to trade
          school for two years, got a degree, and
          now I make the most money of anyone in
          the family.

                    UNCLE JESSE
          You made $800 more than me last year.

                    UNCLE BRIAN
              (”trump card”)
          My house has two bathrooms, Rafa. Two.

Angela materializes out of thin air --

                    ANGELA
          Enough. Both of you.

                    UNCLE BRIAN

          Where did you come from?!

                    ANGELA

          I need to check on the cake.

                    RAFA

Uncle Brian and Uncle Jesse continue arguing. Rafa, sensing
an opportunity to escape, slips away...

          Nope. That’s definitely wrong.

          It needs the apostrophe! Brian -- who’s

                    UNCLE BRIAN
          You know, I saw this documentary on
          Netflix about wealthy families and the
          parties they throw. They have these
          gigantic, very ornate, very expensive
          cakes. I’m talking thousands of dollars
          for a cake. Thousands.

A beat. Uncle Manuel looks at him.

                    UNCLE MANUEL
          ...So is there an apostrophe or not?

                    UNCLE BRIAN
          No idea. It was a good documentary,
          though. You should watch it.

          Damn.

INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Uncle Matt and Uncle Manuel are arguing again about the
apostrophe. Uncle Rick is nearby.

                    UNCLE MATT
              (re: cake)
          Just tell me, is this right?

                    UNCLE RICK
          It’s ugly. So if you meant for it to be
          ugly, then yes, it’s right. Good job.

Uncle Manuel yet again adds an apostrophe on there.

                    UNCLE MANUEL
          Now it’s right.

                    UNCLE MATT
          No, damnit. That’s not what an apostrophe
          is for.

                    UNCLE MANUEL
          Then what’s an apostrophe for?

                    UNCLE MATT
              (no idea)
          ...Not that!

                    UNCLE RICK
              (sips his beer)
          An apostrophe shows ownership. Or it
          combines words.

                    UNCLE MANUEL
          Rick’s right. And it’s Rafa’s cake, so he
          owns it, so it needs an apostrophe.
          Incidentally, “Rick’s right” also has an
          apostrophe in it.

              (sarcastically)
          Maybe try it before the S and also after
          the S, too.

                    UNCLE MATT
          You know what? That’s a good idea. Why
          don’t we just put apostrophes every-
          goddamn-where!

He starts icing everywhere. Angela storms in --

                    ANGELA
          What is going on in here?! Did you finish
          the cake?

                    UNCLE MATT
          ...Kind of?

She takes a look:

ANGLE ON the cake: SC’ONGR’A’TULAT’ION’S’ RAFA!

A complete mess. She’s madder.

                    ANGELA
          Literally all you had to do was write two
          words on a cake!

                    UNCLE MATT
          It’s Manuel’s fault!

                     UNCLE MANUEL
          Shut up!

Uncle Matt shoves Uncle Manuel backward. He crashes into the
table and KNOCKS THE CAKE on the floor.

They all look ashamed. Angela fumes.

                    ANGELA
          I will not let you dolts ruin this. Get
          me a knife.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

Angela enters carrying a TINY CAKE -- she’s cut out the
middle chunk that wasn’t ruined: just a tiny fist-sized cake
with “Rafa!” written on it. Doing her best to keep a positive
energy:

          Why is that cake the tiniest cake in the
          world? Are you the only one who gets to
          eat cake? Mexicans have weird traditions.

Rafa walks over to his mom, serving the cake as best she can.

                    ANGELA
          There you go, Rick.

Rick looks down at the thimble-sized piece of cake.

                    RICK
          I guess I’ll eat half now and save the
          rest for later.

He walks off.

                    RAFA
          Ma, don’t get mad, but I was getting on
          the computer and your bank account page
          was up, and I saw that you only have--

                    ANGELA
              (cutting him off)
          Don’t worry about it, Primo. I have it
          under control.

                    RAFA
          What do you mean “don’t worry about it?”
          It’s the 9th of the month and you only
          have $52 in your account. And I’m wearing
          this coat you got me that cost who knows
          how much, but definitely more than $52,
          and there’s this party going on --

              (cutting him off again)
          You have small eyes, Rafa. You can’t see
          the whole picture yet.

                    RAFA
          Ma, I’m tryna talk to you about real,
          actual issues. Why are you talking like
          The Oracle from The Matrix? College costs
          money that you don’t have. That we don’t

              (off his look)
          This party wasn’t an impromptu purchase.
          Neither was that jacket. I’ve been
          working toward it for weeks.

INT. GROCERY STORE - A MONTH AGO - FLASHBACK

Angela and a MAN chat at the grocery store...

                    ANGELA (V.O.)
          A guy at the grocery store was talking
          about how he had this rash on his foot.

INT. CORNER STORE - FLASHBACK CONTD

Angela makes a deal with a NURSE.

                    ANGELA
          So, you know the nurse’s aide who comes
          into the corner store? She traded me some
          samples of the rash medicine, for some
          bus passes, because I know she rides the
          bus, because it stops near the store and
          I see her getting on it each morning.

                    RAFA (V.O.)
          How’d you get the bus passes?

EXT. BUS STATION - FLASHBACK CONTD

Angela gives the BUS DRIVER a BIG PLATE OF FOOD. He smiles.

                    ANGELA (V.O.)
          I always hear the bus driver complaining
          about eating a cold lunch because his
          break isn’t long enough to get off the
          bus and pick food up somewhere. So I made
          him a hot plate every day for a week, and
          he slipped me a handful of bus passes.

END FLASHBACK

                    ANGELA
          So: hot food to bus driver, bus tokens to
          nurse, foot medicine to guy in the
          grocery store -- and he has a booth at
          the flea market where he sells clothes,
          so he gave me a coat for you.

EXT. STREET - A MONTH AGO - FLASHBACK

Angela walks along and sees a WOMAN in a BROKEN-DOWN CAR --

                    ANGELA (V.O.)
          A month ago, I saw a woman up the street
          whose car wouldn’t start. She needed to
          find an alternator --

                    RAFA (V.O.)
          Stop stop stop.

END FLASHBACK

                    RAFA
          I can’t take it. It’s too much, Ma. Our
          whole life is a Jenga tower!

Angela takes Rafa’s face in her hands.

                    ANGELA
          Don’t worry about any of that, Rafa.
          That’s my job. Your job is to just wear
          your new foot coat.
              (smiles)
          Big eyes.

She kisses him on the forehead and walks away. Rafa watches
her walk into the living room, moving from person to person,
working the room. He looks around the house, then makes a
decision --

He reaches into his pocket, takes out the form the counselor
gave him, looks at it one last time, then crumples it up and
throws it in the trash.

EXT. STREET - 3:30 P.M. WEDNESDAY

Rafa walks with Miguel, Mya, and Harris again after school.

                    MIGUEL
          How was your party last night?

                    RAFA
          ...Fine I guess.

                    MIGUEL
          Your ma invited me. I was gonna come, but
          then I didn’t because I didn’t want to.

                    MYA
          I went. It was crazy. My favorite part
          was the tiny cake. My least favorite part
          was every other thing.

Rafa purses his lips.

                    MYA (CONT’D)
          Hey, why does your family call you
          “Primo?” I kept hearing that. Doesn’t
          that mean “cousin?”

                    RAFA
          Yeah. It started when I was a baby.
          ‘Cause of how my uncles are kind of my
          dad? -- they gave me the nickname. It
          kind of makes sense. Everything in our
          family kind of makes sense.

She chuckles.

                    HARRIS
          Did you figure out if you’re gonna go to
          college or are you gonna work?

                    RAFA
          Probably work. My mom doesn’t have a lot
          of money. I wanna help.
              (off Mya’s look)
          What?

                    MYA
          I just figured you’d pick college. And
          your mom doesn’t really seem like she
          needs a lot of help.

Rafa thinks about that as they walk...

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - LATER

Rafa walks through the construction site, past Jesse’s truck
parked out in front of the site’s temporary trailer.

INT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

Rafa walks in. Uncle Jesse is working.

                    RAFA
          Hey, Uncle Jess. You got a minute?

                    UNCLE JESSE
          Yeah, but not much more. I got your Uncle
          Rick, Matt and Manuel working today, so
          we’re running late, because Matt keeps
          fussing at them about how the kid from
          E.T should’ve never been able to outflank
          the government agents. What’s up?

                    RAFA
          You’ve been saying I should start coming
          to work with you more hours. Is that
          offer still available?

Uncle Jesse looks at him. His interest is piqued.

          want you to hear this conversation him
          and I are about to have so you can know

          Well, not that we can see, but it’s Matt,
          so he could be anywhere. Check to see if
          maybe he climbed inside a desk drawer and
          took a nap.

          If it’s Manuel’s ass, then there’s an
          apostrophe in it.

                    UNCLE JESSE
          If I had to guess which one of y’all had
          an apostrophe in your ass, Manuel would
          absolutely be my first guess.

                    RAFA
              (losing it)
          What is anybody talking about right now?

The door to the trailer opens. It’s Angela, once again
seeming to materialize out of thin air.

                    ANGELA
              (in a loud, stern voice)
          What. Are. Y’all. Doing?!

All the uncles stop talking. Uncle Jesse sits down and
pretends like he’s typing on a computer on the desk.

                    UNCLE BRIAN (V.O.)
              (through phone; nervous)
          ...Is that Angela?

                       ANGELA
          Yes.

                    UNCLE BRIAN (V.O.)
          Oh [bleep].

He hangs up quickly.

                    UNCLE JESSE
          Angela? Good news. Rafa has decided he
          wants to start wor–-

          Close your mouth.
              (to Rafa)
          Your friends are at Miguel’s, waiting for
          you. Go. And be home for dinner.

Rafa sighs and leaves. Angela turns to her brothers and
composes herself.

                    ANGELA (CONT’D)
              (quietly)
          I took the bus here. Could one of you

She leaves.

                    UNCLE MATT
          Oof. Her super quiet calm voice.

                    UNCLE RICK
              (nodding)
          The scariest one. She’s pissed.

Jesse follows her out.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - LATER

Angela walks to Uncle Jesse’s truck. Jesse and Manuel follow.

                    ANGELA
          It’s been a long day, so I don’t want to
          hear anything from any of you about
          yesterday, or the day before that, or any
          day before any day or any night before
          any night. You understand?

        UNCLE MANUEL                        UNCLE JESSE
Yeah.                             Fine.

Beat.

                    UNCLE JESSE (CONT’D)
          I just don’t understand why you’re mad!
          Rafa came to me. I didn’t go to him. He
          came to me and said he wants to work. How
          is that bad?

                    ANGELA
          He decided that because you pressed him.

                    UNCLE MANUEL
          Don’t you want Rafa to go to college?!
          Why aren’t you tell him that? Why aren’t
          you telling him anything? He doesn’t know
          what you want. Nobody does.

                    ANGELA
          What I want is for you all to leave him
          alone about all of this.

                    UNCLE BRIAN
          Okay, but...

                    ANGELA
          There’s no “but.” Y’all need to
          understand that the influence you have on
          him is meaningful. This isn’t just you
          showing him how to ride a bike.

          He’s not a kid anymore. You might push
          him toward making a decision that he’ll
          regret for a long time.
              (before they can object)
          I hope he goes to college. That’s what I
          want. But it’s a decision he has to
          arrive at on his own, or it won’t work.

                    UNCLE JESSE
          That doesn’t make sense. If you want a
          thing, speak up! It’s like a restaurant.
          You don’t just hope for the waiter to
          bring you what you want. You tell him.

Angela smirks at him.

                    ANGELA
          You’re smart today, huh?

                    UNCLE JESSE

                    ANGELA
          Your shirt’s buttoned wrong.

Jesse looks down. He realizes he missed a button.

                    UNCLE JESSE
          Damnit.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NOXT MORNING - 7:00 A.M.

Rafa gets ready for school. Uncle Rick is on the couch
watching TV.

                    UNCLE RICK
          Your mom left for work already. She left
          food for you on the table.

Rafa looks -- there’s nothing there.

                    RAFA
          ...And then you ate it?

                    UNCLE RICK
              (nodding)
          I ate the food, yeah. Sorry.

Rafa shakes his head sadly and decides to just leave. He
snatches up his backpack and heads toward the door.

          Hold up, boy. You forgot something.

                    RAFA
              (snidely)
          What I’d forget, Uncle Rick? My breakfast
          that you ate?

Rick hands him the crumpled up college prep program form.

                    RAFA (CONT’D)
              (confused)
          ...I threw this in the trash like, two
          days ago. How’d you know I threw it away?
          Or even what it was?

                     UNCLE RICK
          I didn’t. I was looking for chicken wings
          that people might’ve tossed out. Most
          people only eat, like, half the meat on a
          chicken wing. If you gather enough of
          them, it’s basically a whole extra meal.
          I call it “trash meat.”
              (then)
          Anyways, I found the paper, looked
          important, so I put it in my pocket.

                    RAFA
          ...Have you been wearing the same pants
          for three days?

                    UNCLE RICK
          Never mind that. What’s going on? Sit
          down, Primo. Talk to your Uncle Rick.

Rafa sits back down.

                    RAFA
          It’s just too much. There are too many
          opinions about what I’m supposed to do.
          And Uncle Jesse is probably right. It’s
          better for me to start working right now.
          I can’t leave. Ma has, like, $50 to her
          name. Who’s gonna take care of her if--

Uncle Rick cuts him off.

                    UNCLE RICK
          Wait, wait, wait. First of all, you don’t
          really think you take care of your mom,
          do you? Because you don’t. She’s been
          taking care of everyone else since she
          was, like, 9 years old.

                    RAFA
          Why is everyone so philosophical all of a
          sudden?!

                    UNCLE RICK
          And second: boo hoo. You got six people
          who give a damn about what happens to
          you. How terrible that must be.

That hits Rafa a little -- he’d never seen it that way.

                    UNCLE RICK (CONT’D)
          Look, I don’t wanna tell you that we’re
          not gonna keep shoving advice into your
          face. Because we are. It’s what we do.
          We’ve done it since you were tiny. We’ll
          do it until we’re all dead. But
          ultimately it’s your call. Whatever you
          decide, we’ll be fine. Your mother’ll be
          fine. Because besides her own toughness,
          she also has us. Her brothers. Every
          single one of us would serve jail time
          for her. And I already have!

                    RAFA
          You didn’t serve jail time for her. You
          served jail time because you crashed your
          motorcycle through the plate glass window
          of a Whataburger.

                    UNCLE RICK
          And I’d do it again, if your mom asked me
          to. Because I’m her brother.

Rafa takes a deep breath.

                    RAFA
          Maybe you’re right. Maybe it’s good for
          me to have all these voices in my li--

INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - LATER THAT MORNING

Betsy walks in, tosses her stuff on her chair, and heads to
her desk. She sees something -- a WRINKLED, SIGNED form from
Rafa. A POST-IT NOTE attached to it says: “I’m in! -- Rafa.”
She smiles. Over this, we hear --

                    RAFA (V.O.)
          Okay, listen up, I have an announcement
          to make.

INT. RAFA’S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

Rafa addresses everyone as they are gathered for DINNER.

                    RAFA
          I’m gonna try to get into college. Some
          of you think it’s a good idea, some think
          it’s a bad idea, but it’s my call, and
          I’ve decided I’m going to try.

It’s quiet and still for a second. Then we see a fist get
extended out. It’s Uncle Rick’s, who’s not even looking at
Rafa because he’s too busy eating his food. Rafa smiles,
reaches out and taps Uncle Rick’s fist with his own.

                    RAFA (CONT’D)
          So, what that means is—

                    UNCLE MATT
          I feel like we get it. You’re going to
