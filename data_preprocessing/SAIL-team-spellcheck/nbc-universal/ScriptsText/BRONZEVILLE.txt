       Fall 1932


EXT. OLD CLAPBOARD CHURCH - NIGHT

A full moon reflects off the Mississippi River. In a clearing
not far from its banks sits an old, WOODEN CHURCH.

Checking over his shoulder, a BLACK MAN approaches ON FOOT.
He knocks on the door. The sound of voices behind the door
immediately stop. Nervous - he waits until the door opens a
crack.

                    MAN AT DOOR (O.C.)
          Was you followed?

The Black Man shakes his head. The MAN AT DOOR sticks his
head out briefly, surveys the surrounding area. Satisfied, he
lets the Black Man inside.


INT. OLD CLAPBOARD CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

The Black Man enters the cramped, sweaty one room edifice to
a meeting already in progress.

He finds a seat in the PEWS that are half-filled with Black
men. Their haggard, thread bare clothes tell us they are not
men of means. The calloused hands, dirt permanently stuck
under their nails and worn, sun-hardened faces say they’re
field hands. Sitting together among them are ARTHUR GRACE,
(40s) heavy-set, strong, earnest and JIMMY TILLMAN (30s)
hungry and charismatic with a fire in his eye.

At the front of the room, AL MORELAND, (white, late 20s)
passionate, idealistic, remains silent until the door is shut
again. On a TABLE beside him are several staple-bound LITTLE
BLUE BOOKS. Some in the audience thumb through copies.

                    MORELAND
          You should all have the right to
          take your harvest directly to
          market. And shop for the best deal
          on your equipment...

                    MAN 1
          Last I checked, suh, they don’t
          give no rights at all to Black
          folk. No deals neither.
                                                            2.


                    MORELAND
          That’s why I’m here, sir. We making
          strides for the working man in
          Alabama. And we’d like to...

Another MAN, LINKWOOD, cuts him off.

                    LINKWOOD
          No disrespect, Mr. Moreland. This
          ain’t Alabama. Words Elaine,
          Arkansas mean anything to you?

Murmurs of agreement from the audience. Arthur speaks up.

                    ARTHUR
          We all know what you think,
          Linkwood. Let the man say his
          piece.

More mutters of agreement and discord throughout the room.

                    MORELAND
          Listen. I know what happened in
          Elaine. I’m working toward a world
          where we can make sure nothin’ like
          that ever happens again.

                    LINKWOOD
          Now he just talkin’ crazy.

Linkwood leaves. As do a few others. As the door closes...

                    MORELAND
          I understand your apprehension. But
          I promise you, if we can stand
          together, there is nothing we...

As Moreland continues, Jimmy whispers to Arthur.

                    JIMMY
          They right you know.

                    ARTHUR
          They yella.

                    JIMMY
          That don’t mean they ain’t right.

                    ARTHUR
          You too, Jimmy? Damn.
                     Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                3.


                    JIMMY
          I ain’t yella. I just don’t see the
          point of begging for crumbs from
          Mr. Charlie when we can...

                    ARTHUR
          Here we go again.

                    JIMMY
          Get real jobs in...

They say it at the same time. But with very different levels
of enthusiasm.

        JIMMY (CONT’D)                       ARTHUR            *
Chicago!                        Chicago.


                    ARTHUR (CONT’D)
          You act like they ain’t got crackas
          up there.

                    JIMMY
          I’m sure they do. But the way I
          hear it them crackas ain’t keeping
          Negros from voting. From workin’ no
          jobs.

                    ARTHUR
          You read The Defender too much. It
          cain’t be all they say it is.

                    JIMMY
          Gots to better than here. Ain’t you
          tired of living like a dog, man?

                    ARTHUR
          That’s why I’m at this meeting,
          Jimmy. Man should be able to make
          his way wherever he call home. You
          just want to go Chicago cuz yo’ ass
          don’t like to work.

                    JIMMY
          These hands wasn’t made to pick
          cotton.

                    ARTHUR
          What was they made for, nigga?                       *

                    JIMMY                                      *
          I ‘on’t know. I’m aimin’ to find                     *
          out.                                                 *
                      Blue Rev. (10/24/20)               4.


They share a laugh.                                             *

                    MAN 1
          You hear that?

The room falls silent as everyone strains to listen. There is
the unmistakeable sound of CAR ENGINES idling. And then...

CRAAAAAASSSSHHHHH!!!!

A ROCK WRAPPED IN A FLAMING RAG crashes through a BACK
WINDOW.

                    MORELAND
          WAIT! Don’t PANIC!

Another FLAMING ROCK SMASHES through the OTHER BACK WINDOW.

Pandemonium erupts as EVERYONE SCATTERS. People knock each
other over running for the front door. Pews tumble. The table
with the Little Blue Books is kicked over.

Arthur starts for the front door, but Jimmy pulls him toward
the back.

                      JIMMY
          This way.

Jimmy rears up and KICKS the BACK DOOR open


EXT. OLD CLAPBOARD CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

...the door flies out SMASHING a white UNION BUSTER in the
face. BLOOD GUSHES from his nose. He drops his SHOTGUN.

Jimmy dashes past the Union Buster who is cupping his ruined
face in his hands. He sprints for the tree line with Arthur.

                    JIMMY
          C’mon, Arthur!!!

                    UNION BUSTER
          GET THEM NIGGAS!

Several other WHITE UNION BUSTERS emerge from the side of the
church and run after Arthur and Jimmy.

As they disappear into the tree line, MORE UNION BUSTERS beat
the fleeing sharecroppers BLOODY with BATS and STICKS around
the front of the church where most of the Union Busters were
waiting to attack.
                                                         5.


EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

Arther and Jimmy tear through the woods. Jimmy is a little
ahead of Arthur. Even running through dense foliage lit only
by moonlight, there is a precision with which he moves.

Arthur not so much. The big man’s FOOT catches on an UPTURNED
ROOT. He goes down HARD. Jimmy turns back for him.

                    JIMMY
          Get up, man. Let’s go.

Arthur grimaces as he clutches his ankle.

                    ARTHUR
          I cain’t. Done twisted it.

                    JIMMY
          Fuck.

Jimmy starts helping him to his feet.

                    ARTHUR
          Go’on, Jimmy. You cain’t tote my
          big ass.

                    JIMMY
          We’ll make for the river. Current
          carry us downstream faster than we
          can run.

                    ARTHUR
          You know I cain’t swim.

                    JIMMY
          You gon’ learn.

He gets him to his feet. Turns to continue, but a WHITE MAN
wielding a CROW BAR, blocks their path.

                    WHITE MAN
          Only thing you niggas gon’ learn is
          to stop causing trouble.

                    JIMMY
          We don’t want no trouble. Just let
          us by. We‘ont want no parts a no
          union no how.

                    WHITE MAN
          Don’t look that way to me.

                    SAP MAN (O.C.)
          Me neither, Ned.
                                                         6.


Arthur and Jimmy turn. Another white man, SAP MAN, has
approached from behind. He wields a BUCHEIMER BLACKJACK SAP.

A look passes between Jimmy and Arthur. Jimmy undrapes
Arthur’s arm from his shoulders and leaves him to stand on
his own. He raises his hands plaintively.

                    JIMMY
          Look. We can work this...

Whatever Jimmy’s got to say bears no interest to White Man.
He SWINGS his Crow Bar HARD. Jimmy barely dodges the blow.

Arthur musters all his strength and leaps toward Sap Man who
swings the sap and connects. But Arthur is able to absorb the
blow with his heavy shoulders. Sap Man is surprised by his
strength. They struggle over the sap.

Jimmy dodges another blow. White Man swings wildly again.
This time Jimmy lets the bar come dangerously close and then
steps past the arc of the White Man’s follow through. He
surprises White Man with a quick JAB to the face. And another
set of rapid fire blows. The man drops his weapon as Jimmy
continues to back him up.

The sap goes flying. Arthur and Sap Man fall to the ground.
Arthur maneuvers to get on top of him where his weight will
give him the advantage. But Sap Man has another idea. He
reaches for the SMITH & WESSON MODEL 10 REVOLVER tucked in
his waist band. Arthur’s eyes go WIDE. He grabs for the gun.

Jimmy PUNCHES White Man with ALL HIS MIGHT. He FALLS to the
ground unconscious. Just as Jimmy turns to help Arthur...

BANG!!! BANG!!!

Sap Man pushes a BLOODIED, GUT SHOT Arthur off of him and
FIRES at Jimmy. TREE BARK explodes just behind Jimmy’s head
as he DIVES out of the way.

Sap Man scrambles to his feet FIRING ANOTHER SHOT at Jimmy
who scurries out of sight - grabbing the crow bar as he goes.


EXT. WOODS/A FEW FEET AWAY - CONTINUOUS

Jimmy takes refuge behind a BIG TREE. He braces himself;
ready to swing. Eyes whipping everywhere. Straining to hear.

MOMENTS LATER

A BOOT hesitates over a TWIG. Then sets down silently just to
it’s side.
                                                           7.


Sap Man approaches as stealthily as he can. Gun cocked and
ready. Up ahead - at the base of the Big Tree, he sees just
the TIP of JIMMY’S SHOE.

He approaches in silence and then whips around the trunk
BLASTING into...air.

He looks down at two EMPTY SHOES. And looks up just in time
to see the CROW BAR as it careens toward his...

THWOCCCK - the unmistakable sound of metal fracturing skull.

Jimmy, SOCKS ONLY adorning his feet, stands over the fallen
man. He swings the bar twice more to be sure. Then drops the
blood stained instrument. Picks up the gun. And his shoes.


EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

Arthur is BLEEDING OUT in the spot where Sap Man left him.
Jimmy crouches next to him. Rocks him awake. He stirs. Weak.

                    JIMMY
          C’mon, Arthur. You gots to get up
          now.

                    ARTHUR
          You was right, Jimmy.

                    JIMMY
          Fuck you talkin’ bout? Get up.

                    ARTHUR
          You’ve seen this before. You know.

                    JIMMY
          I seen people survive worse.

                     ARTHUR
          Good. Then let’s git to Chicago.
          Right now.

                    JIMMY
          Alright. C’mon.

Jimmy tries pulling him up again. But he just slumps in his
arms. Dead with his eyes open.

Jimmy realizes. Takes his moment. Closes his friend’s eyes.

MOMENTS LATER

Jimmy’s SOCK CLAD FOOT kicks White Man until he stirs.
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                    8.


He opens his eyes. He sees Jimmy standing over him holding
Sap Man’s gun at his side.

White Man looks around and sees the slumped corpse of Sap
Man. He starts scooting backward on his hind parts.

                    WHITE MAN
          Now, now, look. Let’s not do
          nothin’ hasty. We can work this
          out.

                    JIMMY
          Yes we can. You know my face?

                    WHITE MAN
          No, suh. No, suh. Never seen ya.

                    JIMMY
          Yes you have. So you might as well
          know my name...

Jimmy raises the gun. Points it right at the man’s head.

                    WHITE MAN
          No, suh! PLEASE!!!

                    JIMMY
          When they ask who sent ya, tell ‘em
          it was Jimmy Tillman.

                    WHITE MAN
          NOOOOOOO.....

He SQUEEZES the TRIGGER.

                                                  CUT TO:


EXT. COPELAND’S - NIGHT

TITLE: Chicago, Illinois

We’re on a BUSTLING AVENUE we will come to know as THE           *
STROLL. The sidewalk is teeming with storefronts of              *
BOUTIQUES, SHOPS and RESTAURANTS. Cars are crushed together.     *
Folks dresses in their SUNDAY BEST are out on the town.          *

A large MARQUIS fixated above the roof of a fancy restaurant
bears the name “Copeland’s.” We drift past the sign into...
                      Blue Rev. (10/24/20)               9.


INT. BACK ALLEY / CHICAGO - NIGHT                               *

...an alley. Narrow. Dark. Empty except for BILLY (mid 20s),
bluster masking fear, who stands with TWO BURLY DUDES. He
tries and fails to light a CIGARETTE.

                    BILLY
          I don’t see what the big deal is.
          I’m saving them...

He cuts himself short as a BACK DOOR opens.

LIGHT spills into the alley as TWO SILHOUETTED FIGURES
emerge. The first, EVERETT COPELAND (mid 30s), an impeccably
and conservatively dressed businessman who prides himself on
being reasoned, pragmatic, smarter than the next guy, steps
uncomfortably close to the scared young man.

                    EVERETT
          This Billy?

                    BURLY DUDE
          Unfortunately for him.

                    EVERETT
          You know who I am?

                      BILLY
          Yes, suh.

                    EVERETT
          You know who he is.

Billy looks over Everett’s shoulder at JESSE (30), Everett’s
younger brother. He’s good looking, but his nose has clearly
been BROKEN a number of times. His suit fits, but not just so
like his brother. He stares at Billy - a promise of violence.

Billy swallows his words. Nods instead.

                    EVERETT (CONT’D)
          We understand you fixed some
          numbers.

Billy mumbles something unintelligible. Jesse starts            *
UNBUTTONING his jacket.                                         *

                    EVERETT (CONT’D)
          I’d start talkin’ if I was you.                       *

                    BILLY                                       *
          I was trying to save you...save you                   *
          some money, suh.                                      *
                      Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                10.


                    EVERETT
          You damage our rep, you cost us
          money. You understand that?

                      BILLY
          Yes, suh.

Everett slides a WAD OF CASH out of his pocket and into
Billy’s shirt pocket.

                    EVERETT
          Go make it right. The number hits.                    *
          You pay. Got it?

                      BILLY
          Yes, suh.

                      EVERETT
          Now.

Billy takes off full speed down the alley.

Everett and Jesse head back inside...


INT. COPELAND’S - CONTINUOUS

...the elegant, high-end restaurant that bares their name.
Everett speaks to the MAITRE’D who holds the door open.

                    EVERETT

and most irresponsible of the Copeland Brothers, launches a
CHAMPAGNE CORK across the room.

                    ZEKE
          To my baby sister!

                    ELOISE
          That’s enough, Ezekiel.                               *

The family matriarch, “LADY” ELOISE COPELAND(late 50s), a
wise, traditional woman who is always in-charge, secretly or
not, gently reprimands her son. Next to her, the baby, LISA
“LILI” COPELAND (25) intelligent eyes, earnest and at the
moment quiet.

                    ZEKE
          But you haven’t even had any.
          C’mon, Ma. It’s for her big day.

                    ELOISE
          No thank you.

                    ZEKE
          Pop ain’t here.

                    ELOISE
          Boy.

He puts down the glass he poured and sits chastened.

                    ELOISE (CONT’D)
          Instead of trying to turn this
          little dinner into a party all a                      *
          sudden, you need to explain to me
          why y’all throwing a big event
          tomorrow and the guest of honor is
          not my LiLi.

                    LISA
          Ma. This is plenty. I don’t need...

                    ELOISE
              (to Lisa)
          Hush. You’re too modest.
              (to Zeke)
          She should have the celebration
          you’re planning tomorrow.
                      Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                12.


                    ZEKE
          You don’t understand, Ma. That’s
          different. If Joe wins this fight -
          he’s on his way.

                    ELOISE
          To what? A lifetime of getting beat
          about the head by other men
          standing around in their underwear?

                    ZEKE
          It’s not like that.

                      ELOISE
          It’s not?

An ATTENDANT opens the door as Everett and Jesse enter.         *

                    ZEKE                                        *
              (to Everett and Jesse)                            *
          She wants us to cancel the party.

                    ELOISE
          No. I want you to do something for
          your family instead of some boxer
          you barely know.

                    ZEKE
          It is for the family.

                      ELOISE
          How?

                    EVERETT
          We stand to make a lot of money.

                    JESSE
          And it’s good for the race.                           *

                    ELOISE
          You all do plenty for the race
          already. Half the Negroes that got
          jobs in this city work for you.

                    JESSE
          People need a champ, Ma. Gives ‘em
          hope.

                    EVERETT
          Why don’t we do both? Celebrate
          Joe’s victory. And Lisa’s 1st day
          at work. Could be like a
          debutante’s ball...
                     Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                 13.


            ELOISE                           LISA               *
I like that.                    I’m nobody’s debutante.         *

                     EVERETT
          We’d still get to promote our
          contender. Lisa gets to meet some
          of the more eligible prospects in
          town. Hell, maybe Joe takes a shine
          to her.

                    LISA
          I’m not interested in no damn
          boxer.

                    ELOISE
          Watch your mouth, young lady.

                    JESSE
          Lisa - do you want a party?

                    LISA
          No. I keep trying to say that.

                    JESSE
          Ma. She don’t want it. Don’t make                     *
          her.

                    ELOISE
          Then cancel it.

            ZEKE                              JESSE             *
Toldja.                         Ma!                             *

                    EVERETT
          We’ve already invited half the
          town. Hazel and Esther are at the
          club setting things up right now.

                    JESSE                                       *
          Please, Ma.                                           *

                    LISA                                        *
          Let ‘em have their party.                             *

Eloise sits unmoved. Zeke throws back some champagne.

A sudden, quiet KNOCK on the door breaks the tension.

                     JESSE
          What!?

The Maitre’D enters tentatively. He is dragging a PHONE with
a LONG CHORD with him.
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                14.


                    MAITRE’D
          I’m sorry, Mr. Copeland. It’s Mr.
          Roxborough. He insisted.

Everett takes the phone.

                    EVERETT
              (into phone)
          What now?


INT. ROXY’S GYM / RING - MORNING

WHAAAAAM!!!!

SWEAT DROPLETS leap off a MAN’S FACE as a LEATHER BOXING MITT
SMASHES into it. The Man stumbles backwards.

He manages to get his MITTS up in a defensive position as his
opponent, JOE LOUIS BARROW (18), skinny but ripped, maybe
angry, stalks toward him and unleashes a fusillade of
punishing blows. The two are in a ring in the middle of a
modest, well-kept boxing gym.

FOUR OBSERVERS, obscured by shadow, watch from the upstairs
office window.


INT. ROXY’S GYM / OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                           *

The office is dark, smoky. Thick tension sits on the room.

Everett and Jesse talk with fellow Policy Kings, LUCKY SMITH
(45) and JOHN “ROXY” ROXBOROUGH (40), Joe’s manager.

                    JESSE
          What’s the big deal? Didn’t this
          bastard already agree to the fight.

                    ROXY
          He did. But now he’s getting cold
          feet. Says if his man loses to a
          colored, it could ruin him.

                    JESSE
          Fuck ‘em both. Shouldn’t be no
          fighter if he’s scary.

                    EVERETT
          But he’s not scary is he?
                                              15.


                  ROXY
        I don’t think so. Started talkin’
        ‘white boy.’ Said the terms don’t
        reflect his client’s exposure.

                  LUCKY
        How much we talkin’?

                  EVERETT
        Didn’t say a number did he?

                    ROXY
        Nope.

                  EVERETT
        Of course. Let us figure out how
        much the fight is worth to us.

                  JESSE
        Wait a second. We already agreed to
        give him the gate and half the
        purse. Even if we win. You not
        actually thinking about paying this
        cocksucker more are you?

                  EVERETT
        I’m not thinking of doing shit.

                  JESSE
        You just gon’ let the fight go?

                    EVERETT
        Jesse....

                    JESSE
        What!?

                  EVERETT
        Get a hold of yourself, little
        brother.

                  JESSE
        Tired of these fuckin’ crackas.

                  EVERETT
        You finished?

Beat.

                  EVERETT (CONT’D)
        We’ll be there. They can show up if
        they want. Or they can forfeit.
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                16.


Jesse’s not finished. He storms out of the office. Slamming
the door behind him. Everett watches after him a beat.

                    EVERETT (CONT’D)
          Sorry, Roxy.

                    ROXY
          He’s right. Forfeiture ain’t a K.O.

                    EVERETT
          It’s a bluff.

                    ROXY
          I dunno. Might want to set a
          precedent. Sides - he don’t need
          the fight. We do.

                    LUCKY                                     *
          No we don’t. We make our bread off                  *
          the numbers. This just gravy.                       *

                    ROXY                                      *
          This is legal.                                      *

                    EVERETT
          Can’t we fight somebody else?

                    ROXY
          Not tonight. Dewey Sanders has to
          be his next fight. Joe beat him, we
          on our way.

                    LUCKY
          Where? And how much more money it                   *
          gon’ take to get there?                             *

                    ROXY
          When he gets his weight up, I
          believe we might be looking at the
          next Jack Johnson.

                    LUCKY
          They ain’t never gonna be no
          ‘nother Jack Johnson.

                    ROXY
          But what if there is? Can you
          imagine what it would mean?

                    LUCKY
          I know. That’s why we done what we
          did already. But I can’t see it.
          Here, there.

          Somewhere along the way - they gon’
          make sure the nigga don’t win.

                    EVERETT

          Tell him the terms is the terms.                      *
          We’ll see him tonight. Or we won’t.

Roxy exits.

                    LUCKY
          Jesse’s in a state. You shoulda
          brought Zeke along to calm his ass
          down.

                    EVERETT
          He’s supposed to be here.

                    LUCKY
          So where is he?

On Everett, asking the same question.

An UPSCALE BACHELOR’S PAD. There are framed photos everywhere   *
of Zeke with his arm draped around or lifting glasses with      *
luminaries of the day like ROBERT ABBOTT, LOUIS ARMSTRONG,      *

assortment of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN including a not yet famous        *
KATHERINE DUNHAM and POLICY KINGS like POLICY SAM, MUSHMOUTH    *
JOHNSON and THE JONES BROTHERS. The COUCH is the finest         *
leather. The TABLE, BAR - SOLID MACASSAR EBONY. All the         *
LIQUOR - TOP SHELF. The latest and most expensive PHONOGRAPH    *
PLAYER AND RADIO and several ROLLEIFLEX CAMERAS adding a        *
distinct panache to the place.                                  *

A man and WOMAN’S CLOTHES are DISCARDED haphazardly across      *
the floor from the front door to the couch. The Woman (20s)     *
voluptuous, uninhibited, is bent over said couch screaming in
delight as Zeke fucks her from behind.

                    WOMAN (O.S.)
          Oh Zeke! Right there, baby! Right
          there! OH GOD, OH GOD...

CRAAAAASH - the DOOR JAM splinters as A LARGE MAN KICKS in
the FRONT DOOR.

                    WOMAN (CONT’D)
              (terrified)
          Oh GOD!

spins and instinctively tries to pull his PANTS up from
around his ankles.

                    LARGE MAN
          Not so fast.

He levels a REMINGTON .45 CALIBER M1911 at Zeke who slowly
stands back up - hands raised in the air - careful to place
his body between the Woman and the gun.

FRANK “BETTER OFFER” BARNES, (40s) a stylish gentleman with a   *

The Woman quickly slides past Zeke, covering her nakedness as
best she can as she grabs a few of her garments off the floor
and scurries out the door. Better Offer tips his hat and
closes the door behind her while Zeke buttons his pants.

Nestled on the historic, well-manicured 5900 block of South      *
Park Avenue, the Copeland Mansion sits kitty corner to the
former home of Chicago’s 1st Black banker, Jesse Binga.

Eloise calls to the WHITE DRIVER waxing the CADILLAC.

                     ELOISE
          Make sure it sparkles. I want
          everything perfect for my baby’s
          first day.

                    WHITE DRIVER
          Yes, Ma’am.

She heads into...


INT. COPELAND MANSION / FOYER - CONTINUOUS                       *

...the massive foyer and heads up the stairwell. Her hand
holds a beautiful HAND-CARVED BANNISTER as she ascends.

Art by prominent and yet-known Negro artists of the day hangs
on the walls. Among them are pieces by HENRY OSSAWA TANNER,
ARCHIBALD MOTLEY, WILLIAM H. JOHNSON and early works by
CHARLES WHITE. In the center of them all is an OIL PORTRAIT
of a YOUNGER ELOISE with her late husband, ROYAL COPELAND, a
handsome, if not stern, officious looking man.
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                21.


They are surrounded by Everett, Jesse, Zeke and Lisa when       *
they were much younger. In the painting, Lisa looks to be       *
about 8 years old.                                              *


INT. COPELAND MANSION / UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Eloise pushes down the long hallway adorned with more Black
art. She passes “Girl in a Green Dress” by William H. Johnson
before she opens a door without knocking and enters...


INT. COPELAND MANSION / LISA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

...interrupting Lisa who is trying to mask her nerves in
chiffon. She stands in front of an elegant FULL LENGTH MIRROR
staring at the FLORAL PRINT DRESS she’s wearing. It is modest
and professional. Just slightly more daring than the GREEN
DRESS she’s holding up to consider.                             *

                    LISA
          Mom...

                    ELOISE
          You ain’t got nothin’ I ain’t seen
          and nothin’ I ain’t make.

                    LISA
          You never fail to remind me.

                    ELOISE
          Look at my little LiLi Swan.
          College graduate. First day working
          at Chicago United Savings and Loan.

                    LISA
          It’s not a big deal, Mom.

                    ELOISE
          It is to me. And it would be to
          your father if he was still here.
          Thank God you didn’t drop out of
          school like Everett. Or get kicked
          out like Jesse.

                    LISA
          They’re men. They have the luxury
          of...

                    ELOISE
          They’re Negro men. They don’t have
          any luxuries.
                     Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                22.


                    LISA
          You know what I’m saying.

                    ELOISE
          I do. That’s why I want you to make
          a good impression. Be courteous,
          polite. Don’t talk unless he asks
          you something directly. And when
          you do - soften your voice. You
          want to speak loud enough for Mr.
          Randolph to hear you without
          straining. But that’s it.

                    LISA
          Be seen and not heard.

                     ELOISE
          Exactly.

                    LISA
          That is not why I took this job,
          Mom. And that’s not why Mr.
          Randolph hired me.

                    ELOISE
          Mr. Randolph hired you because he
          was your father’s oldest friend.
          And if you’ve got half the sense I
          think you have, you’ll look at this
          job as an opportunity to listen and
          to earn his trust.

                    LISA
          And when do I talk?

                    ELOISE
          No time soon if you want to learn
          anything.

She starts out the room, but pauses at the door.

                    ELOISE (CONT’D)
          The flowers look good on you.

On Lisa, annoyed at every bit of her mother’s counsel.


INT. COPELAND MANSION / KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Like the rest of the house, the kitchen is extremely well      *
appointed. The most MODERN FIXTURES embedded in the classic    *
architecture.                                                  *
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                23.


Jesse is in the kitchen stuffing BILLS into a DISLODGED WOOD
PANEL along the base of the cabinet. He looks grim.

Eloise walks in and surprises him.

                    ELOISE
          Boy, I told you I’m not gonna use
          any of that money.

                    JESSE
          It’s here if you need it.

                    ELOISE
          Your father took care of me. You
          don’t have to.

                    JESSE
          Nonetheless.

He replaces the wood and stands up.

                    ELOISE
          What’s wrong?

                    JESSE
          Nothin’, Ma. Gotta run.

He bolts the kitchen. Eloise picks up the PHONE and dials.

                    ELOISE
          Morning. Everett and Jesse are at                     *
          it again.                                             *


INT. TRAIN / BOX CAR - DAY

Cargo packed in stacks of WOODEN CRATES jostle rhythmically
in the dark, crowded box car. Jimmy Tillman sits amongst
them. He looks as if he has not slept. He wears the same
clothes from the ruined meeting several nights before. He’s
face is streaked with TEARS.

He wipes his face. Approaches the sliver of DAYLIGHT slipping
through the CRACK in the BOX CAR DOORS. Cautiously, he peers
through the opening.

                    JIMMY
              (sotto)
          Damn. Arthur.


EXT. ILLINOIS CENTRAL TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS                *

This is not Arkansas.
                                                          24.


The station itself is HUGE. An ENORMOUS   MASS OF PEOPLE crowd
around the tracks awaiting the oncoming   TRAIN. More, it seems
than the entire population of Arkansas.   There are COLORED,
WHITE, ASIAN and HISPANIC PEOPLE - each   group circled in an
enclave of its own.

Many await loved ones. Or have tickets and baggage of their
own and plan to board the train for its next destination.
Then there are the PEDDLERS, VALETS, CABBIES, PORTERS, POLICY
WRITERS and OTHER HUSTLERS who have all descended on this
crush of humanity in hopes of making their daily bread.

PAPER BOYS loudly hawk their respective NEWSPAPERS: the
Chicago Tribune, Chicago American, Chicago Daily Times. The
group of BLACK PAPER BOYS that sell THE CHICAGO DEFENDER, no
doubt aware that their paper is in the middle of a very
intentional campaign to draw Southern Blacks to Chicago, are
among the loudest of them all.

                    BLACK PAPER BOY
          Get The Defender! Your Guide to the
          Promised Land!

                    BLACK PAPER BOY 2
          Defender! Get your Defender!

There’s also the BULLS, a group of white men wielding BILLY
CLUBS who have a particular interest in the cargo cars of the
train. One of which has scrawled on its side: “Farewell -
We’re Good and Gone. Bound for the Promised Land.”

The train BELCHES SMOKE as it grinds to a halt and announces
itself with a LOUD WHISTLE.

The Bulls start moving toward the various cargo cars.


INT. TRAIN / BOX CAR - CONTINUOUS

Jimmy spies the Bulls fanning out. A couple approach his car.

                    JIMMY
          Shit.

He retreats back into the shadows.


INT/EXT. TRAIN / BOX CAR - MOMENTS LATER

The Bulls throw the doors to Jimmy’s car open. Even fully
illuminated by daylight, Jimmy is nowhere in sight.

                    BULL 1
          I’ll check it.
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                25.


BULL 1 jumps inside and starts walking through the stacks,
looking around, indiscriminately tapping the crates with his
BILLY CLUB to see if they sound odd.

He is approaching a PARTICULAR CRATE towards the far end of
the car when he hears...

                    RANDOM BULL (O.S.)
          Hey! You! Git back here!

Bull 1 immediately turns and jumps off the car.

He and Bull 2 join the others in running after a STOWAWAY.


INT. TRAIN / BOX CAR - CONTINUOUS

The LID pops off of that particular crate. From inside, Jimmy
quickly lowers the lid to the floor and climbs out.


EXT. TRAIN / BOX CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Jimmy sticks his head out the box car door. He sees the crowd
dispersing as the Stowaway tries to run away. But the Bulls
catch him and proceed to BEAT HIM MERCILESSLY.

While almost everyone’s distracted, Jimmy slips off the train
and quickly approaches the crowd. One man, CASPER(30), a
dandy sporting a GOLD POCKET WATCH and a matching GOLD TOOTH,
clocks him while he talks to a female POLICY CUSTOMER.          *

                    POLICY CUSTOMER                             *
          ...I ain’t no Copeland. Just have
          to be a day number today.

                    CASPER
              (with a wink)
          And hopefully a gig tomorrow.
          Before you know it, you’ll be
          havin’ ‘em over for dinner.

She laughs as she digs for change.

For Jimmy, it’s easy to get lost in a crowd this size. He
notices TICKETED BLACK PASSENGERS disembarking the train in
droves. There are joyous and tearful reunions all over the
platform.

Jimmy tucks his head and continues moving briskly toward the
exit hoping to go unnoticed. He walks by CASPER who is
finishing the exchange of a POLICY SLIP for a NICKEL with the   *
female customer. Casper excuses himself and follows after       *
Jimmy.
                                                26.


                    CASPER (CONT’D)
          Man with your luck don’t need to
          rush.

Jimmy ignores him. Casper falls in step.

                    CASPER (CONT’D)
          You must look like your Mama.

                    JIMMY
          What? The fuck you just say?

                    CASPER
          Don’t mean no offense, Country.
          Just observing that you was born
          for luck.

                    JIMMY
          How you figure?

                    CASPER
          How you not? You saw what happened
          to your fellow striver.

                    JIMMY
          I don’t know what you talkin’ bout.

                    CASPER
          I ain’t the law, man. Just tryna
          put a little money in your pocket?

                    JIMMY
          You gonna put money in my pocket?

                    CASPER
          After you put some in mine. A
          nickel gets you five dollars.
          Five’ll get you plenty. Just tell
          me your 3 favorite numbers and we
          be on our way.

                    JIMMY
          I ain’t the gambling type.

                    CASPER
          You sure? The squares usually buy
          tickets when they ride the train.

                    JIMMY
          Get away from me, man. I don’t know
          you.
                      Blue Rev. (10/24/20)              27.


                    CASPER
          I reckon you don’t know nobody. But
          everybody needs a friend in
          Chicago.

                    JIMMY
          Do I look like I got money?

                    CASPER
          You look like you got a good head
          on your shoulders. Good enough to
          bet on yourself. And good enough to
          bet on the right candidate when the
          time comes.

                    JIMMY
          Now you want me to vote? I just got
          here.

                    CASPER
          We’ll get you set up. Just make
          sure you remember who your friends
          are when it’s election time.

                    JIMMY
          You can help me find a place?
          Cheap?

                    CASPER
          Cheap is my specialty. I know the
          perfect spot. Come with me.

Jimmy hesitates. Casper offers his megawatt smile. The glint
from the sun bouncing off his gold tooth is almost blinding.

                    JIMMY
              (sotto)
          Fuck it.

They start walking.

                    JIMMY (CONT’D)
          Name’s not Country. It’s Jimmy.

                    CASPER
          Please to meet you, Jimmy. Casper.

                    JIMMY
          They really let Negroes vote up                      *
          here?

                    CASPER
          Let us? Shiiit. These crackas need
          us.

EXT. CHICAGO UNITED SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY

A beehive of patrons swarms in and out of Bronzeville’s own     *
DEPARTMENT STORE. Across State Street, nestled on the corner    *
in the shadow of the Bates Building sits Chicago United. A      *
large HAND PAINTED SIGN on the open brick wall of the
adjacent building says “INVEST IN YOUR OWN AT CHICAGO UNITED    *
SAVINGS & LOAN.”                                                *


INT. CHICAGO UNITED SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY                        *

Sunlight streams through LARGE, ARCHED WINDOWS bathing the      *
bank’s mid-day rush in warm light. Every teller, manager and    *
customer is Colored.

Towards the back of the main floor, Lisa, now wearing the
GREEN DRESS, sits at a desk strategically positioned in front
of a CLOSED OFFICE DOOR with the words “MANAGER” stenciled
across the frosted glass. She is talking to an older
customer, MR. FERGUSON (60s) feeble and distraught. He leans
unsteadily on a CANE.

                    LISA
          Mr. Randolph will see you as soon
          as he can, sir. If you’ll just take
          a seat...

                    MR. FERGUSON
          Please, Miss. Our little house is
          alls we got. I told my fool wife
          not to pay no never-mind to no damn
          dream book, but she run off and
          done it anyhow. Now we ain’t got
          the mortgage again. I’s just hoping
          Mr. Randolph could find it in his
          heart to give us a little relief.

Lisa stands and starts steering him over to the waiting area.

                    LISA
          I’m so sorry to hear that, Mr.
          Ferguson. I’m sure Mr. Randolph
          will do everything he can to help
          you. Now if you don’t mind taking a
          seat right over here, I will make
          certain that you are his very next
          customer.

                    MR. FERGUSON
          You sho’ is sweet, Miss. Thank...
              (suddenly excited)
          Oh shit.
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                29.


Lisa turns. Sees what he sees. Her older brother, Everett,
striding into the bank as if he owns it. Some customers point
him out; others tip their hats. A few pretend not to see him,
but what’s clear is that everybody notices as he passes.

                    MR. FERGUSON (CONT’D)
          Pardon me, Miss. Not every day you
          see one of the Copeland Brothers.                     *
          The head brother at that.                             *

                    LISA
          Excuse me please.

Moving as quickly and casually as she can, Lisa returns to
her post and sits just before Everett arrives.

                    EVERETT
          How’s the first day on the big job?

                    LISA
          What do you want, Everett?

                    EVERETT
          I need to talk to your boss.

                    LISA
          You’ll have to come back. He’s in a
          meeting right now.

                    EVERETT
          Tell him it’s me.

                    LISA
          It doesn’t matter. They’re
          customers waiting. One in
          particular who lost his mortgage
          payment playing policy.

                    EVERETT
          And you think that’s my fault.

                    LISA
          Our fortune is built on the backs                     *
          of the less fortunate.

                    EVERETT
          You sound like Dad.                                   *

                    LISA
          Daddy was right.                                      *

                    EVERETT
          I don’t have time, Lili. He called
          me.
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                   30.


                    LISA
          Have a seat. I’ll let Mr. Randolph
          know you’re here.

                    EVERETT
          Lisa...

                    LISA
          You’re gonna wait. Like everybody
          else for a change.

                    EVERETT
          And you will lose your little job
          if I do.

                     LISA
          Are you going to be the one that
          tells Mom you got me fired on my
          first day?

                    EVERETT
          Jesus Christ. Here.

Everett abruptly counts out SEVERAL BILLS onto her desk.

                    LISA
          What’s this for?

                    EVERETT
          The old man. Now tell Mr. Randolph
          I’m here.

Lisa smiles wryly as she stands. Raps quietly on the door.

                    RANDOLPH (O.S.)
          Come in, Lisa.

Just before she cracks the door, Everett offers...

                    EVERETT
          How sweet. You look just like the
          girl in Mom’s favorite painting.

On Lisa, wry smile erased. Now more annoyed than ever.

                    LISA
          Sorry to disturb you, Mr.
          Randolph...


INT. CHICAGO UNITED SAVINGS & LOAN / OFFICE - LATER              *

The office is decorated with more taste and capital than one
would expect in a bank manager’s office.
                      Blue Rev. (10/24/20)              31.


Everett and CURTIS “EYEBALL” RANDOLPH (50s), regal, a         *
gangster turned statesman dressed in an exquisite IMPORTED    *
ITALIAN SUIT, talk in hushed tones. It’s clear, he’s more     *
than just a bank manager.                                     *

                    RANDOLPH
          You been having trouble with any of
          your wheels?

                    EVERETT
          Some idiot who tried to change the                  *
          numbers after the pull. I
          straightened him out.

                      RANDOLPH
          No raids?

Everett raps the desk.

                    EVERETT
          None yet. But not sure how long our
          protection lasts with the new                       *
          administration in place.                            *

                    RANDOLPH
          I know. I’m working on it.

                    EVERETT
          That’s why you called me down here?
          You wanna talk about Cermak again?

                    RANDOLPH
          Actually - I heard you and Jesse
          are having problems.

                    EVERETT
          Who told you? Roxy? Lucky?                          *

                    RANDOLPH
          Doesn’t matter. What’s going on?

                     EVERETT
          Sanders’ manager wants more money
          for the fight. Jesse wants to
          handle it.

                    RANDOLPH
          Well you don’t want that.

                      EVERETT
          Exactly.

                    RANDOLPH
          So, he’s mad you’re paying him.
                     Blue Rev. (10/24/20)               32.


                    EVERETT
          I’m not paying him.

                     RANDOLPH
          Why not?

                    EVERETT
          Cuz fuck these crackas.

                    RANDOLPH
          Now you sound like Jesse.

                    EVERETT
          He’s not all wrong. Hell I agree
          with him - a Colored Heavyweight
          Champ will do wonders for the race.
          And our balance sheets.

                    RANDOLPH
          So then pay. The more legitimate
          businesses we have the better. Plus-
          you don’t want your brother
          upsetting the balance of things. We
          got enough trouble with Cermak in
          office as it is.

                    EVERETT
          Fine. About Cermak...?

Randolph moves to the wall. Flips back a painting, “The Good   *
Shepherd” by Tanner. Behind it, a HIDDEN SAFE. He starts       *
removing CASH.

                     RANDOLPH
          Yes.

                    EVERETT
          All due respect - I just don’t see                   *
          it.

                     RANDOLPH
          Why not?

                    EVERETT
          Did the Democrats free the slaves?

                    RANDOLPH
          No. And neither did Big Bill
          Thompson.

                    EVERETT
          He did a lot more for us than that
          Czech bastard ever will.
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)        33.


                     RANDOLPH
          That Czech bastard won. He’s the
          Mayor now.

                    EVERETT
          So we’re just supposed to fall in
          line. Throw out 65 years of party
          loyalty because we lost one
          election.

                    RANDOLPH
          We’re not loyal to a party. We’re
          loyal to our interests.

                    EVERETT
          And Anton Cermak is serving our
          interest? Raiding wheels and
          arresting every other writer we
          know.

                    RANDOLPH
          He wants us to fall in line. He             *
          knows the Republican machine is
          gonna pull out all the stops to
          take City Hall back. He won’t win           *
          again without us.                           *

                    EVERETT                           *
          Not gonna get our vote with the             *
          shit he’s doing now.                        *

                    RANDOLPH                          *
          It’s the only way he knows to deal          *
          with Negroes.                               *

                    EVERETT
          So we should teach him a lesson and         *
          vote his ass outta office. Before           *
          he destroys the policy business.            *

                    RANDOLPH
          Three long years till we elect a            *
          new mayor. But if we get on his             *
          side now, we can control him.               *

                    EVERETT
          How we gon’ do that?

Randolph hands him a FEW BRICKS OF CASH.

                    RANDOLPH
          I’m gonna talk to him.
                       Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                34.


                      EVERETT
            Let me know how that goes. In the
            mean time, I’ll go pay the man.

                      RANDOLPH
            Make sure you call Jesse first.

                      EVERETT
                (getting up to leave)
            I’ll take care of it.

                       RANDOLPH
            Everett.

He stops.

                      RANDOLPH (CONT’D)
            You guys are better together than
            you are apart.

On Everett, knowing that it’s true.                              *


EXT. LESTER DANIEL’S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

The Northside. Most of the commuters are Caucasian.

LESTER DANIELS (30s) aka THE MANAGER leaves the office
building and approaches an awaiting PACKARD on the curve. A
NEGRO DRIVER holds the door open and closes it behind him.


I/E. PACKARD - LATER

Lester Daniels reads the CHICAGO TRIBUNE as the car cruises
along. He notices that the car passes his turn.                  *

                      LESTER
            You missed your turn. You’re
            supposed to turn right on 79th.                      *

The Negro Driver does not respond or look up. It is odd.

                      NEGRO DRIVER                               *
            You got another appointment, you’ll
            be wanting to keep, Mr. Daniels.

As he speaks, he raises a REVOLVER so Lester can see it. Then
lays it on the seat next to him.

On Lester, silent now. And afraid.

EXT. SOUTHSIDE POLICY BANK - DAY

Jimmy and Casper walk through a rough part of the Southside.
The block is lined with STORE FRONTS and TENEMENT BUILDINGS
in varying stages of disrepair. A RADIO broadcasts Jack L.      *
Cooper’s “The All Negro Hour” from an OPEN WINDOW.

It is all breathtaking to Jimmy - who has not seen a section
of a city of this magnitude filled with nothing but Negroes.
There are some BUMS here and there, but also many Negroes
driving cars and trucks, hustling their wares from the
corners. One such brother, a NUMBERS RUNNER, is in the middle
of a furtive transaction with an OLD WOMAN. She is handing
him some MONEY when a BEAT COP rounds the corner.

                    OLD WOMAN
          I ain’t know’d whether to play my
          Myron’s name or Little Darryl. But
          since Myron ain’t got the rent I...

The Numbers Runner drops her CHANGE on the ground and takes
off - running away from the Beat Cop who gives chase.

                    JIMMY
          Y’all got colored cops too?

                    CASPER
          Not much better than the white ones
          you ask me. Folks just tryin’ to
          make their way through the panic
          and these toms wanna make it
          harder.

                    JIMMY
          Jobs all dried up?

                    CASPER
          Lotta folks outta work since the
          crash. But there’s still more
          Negroes working here than anywhere
          on Earth.                                             *

                    JIMMY
          That’s not true.                                      *

                    CASPER
          Sure it is. Cuz there’s more                          *
          Negroes on the south side of                          *

          Everybody read the same paper brung
          you here, Jimmy. More people. More                    *
          jobs. More opportunity. Let’s cut                     *
          through this alley.                                   *

They turn off the main drag into an alley.

                    JIMMY
          You know anybody hiring?

                    CASPER
          Depends on the kinda work you
          looking for. What you used to do
          back in...where you say you came
          from again?

TWO ROUGH MEN brandishing KNIVES step from the SHADOWS.

          cash. And your gold watch. You too.
          Empty your pockets.

          You’re making a mistake.

                    ROUGH MAN
          Shut the fuck up. Hand it over!

Jimmy’s hands move toward his waist. Rough Man 2 charges.

Jimmy starts to pull the Smith & Wesson, but Casper grabs his
hand - stopping him - before he can pull it all the way out.

                    JIMMY
          What the hell you doin’?

                    CASPER

              (walking ahead)
          Welcome to Bronzeville. Home of the
          Copeland Brothers. Far as I know -
          the owners and operators of more
          policy wheels than anybody in
          Chicago.

                    JIMMY
          What’s a wheel?


EXT. COPELAND'S HABERDASHERY - DAY                              *

Copeland’s Haberdashery sits in the middle of a bustling
block known as Whiskey Row years ago when it was the center
of the city’s Red Light District. Now it is a brisk             *
commercial district filled with Black-owned businesses.         *

                    CASPER (V.O.)
          The wheel’s a bank. Not no Savings
          and Loan. It’s where they pull the
          numbers and people find out whether
          they hit or not. And get their
          cash. $20 for a dime gig. $200 for
          jacks if you got the balls.

One PATRON races toward the storefront.


INT. COPELAND’S HABERDASHERY - DAY

A surprisingly large group of CUSTOMERS are gathered in the     *
front room of this tailor’s shop in the middle of the
afternoon. That is because despite the presence of SEWING
MACHINES, MANNEQUINS and WORK COUNTERS that are the tell-tale
signs of a tailoring business, most are not gathered to get
their trousers hemmed.

                    JIMMY (V.O.)
          They can front all that?

                    CASPER (V.O.)
          Course they can. Folk say they rake
          in millions off those nickel and
          dime bets. Plus they own more
          shops, stores, restaurants than you
          could shake a stick out. Some are
          full legit.

A RADIO in the shop is also carrying WSBC’s broadcast of “The
All Negro Hour,” but no one’s really listening.
                      Blue Rev. (10/24/20)              39.


All eyes are focused on the back corner of the room where the
POLICY BANKER, a formidable, stern looking man packing a
BARELY CONCEALED GUN, stands watching over the crowd. He
calls to a LOOKOUT hanging by the front door.

                    POLICY BANKER
          The law out there?

The Lookout, also STRAPPED, briefly steps outside and looks
over the block. He steps back in and gives the ALL CLEAR SIGN
to the Policy Banker. He positions himself so he BLOCKS the
door.

Which he LOCKS.

The radio is TURNED OFF.

A DRAPE is removed from the back counter revealing a small
WOODEN BARREL (aka the “WHEEL”.)

A BLIND-FOLDED POLICY WRITER begins spinning the Wheel which
has almost 80 small NUMBERED RUBBER CAPSULES inside. He is
flanked by the Policy Banker who stands ready to take the
capsules from the Writer as he pulls them out. Ponds is also
there, positioned near the door to the back office. Like the
Policy Banker, he is ARMED.

The room is LOUD and ELECTRIC. The Policy Writer stops the
spin and begins to draw the first number. The hopeful           *
Customers, most of whom clutch POLICY SLIPS, alternately call   *
out the numbers they are hoping for, close their eyes in
prayer or make other petitions to Higher Powers for a
financial blessing.

                    CASPER (V.O.)
          Loan money to people to start they
          own businesses too. They the
          backbone of this community. So
          don’t nobody wanna fuck wit’ em.
          Plus they’ll kill you if you do.

Everything goes silent when the Policy Banker looks over to
the back office door as Everett Copeland steps out. Everett
calls to the Banker...

                      EVERETT
          Carry on.

...and the organized noise continues. He speaks to Ponds.

                    EVERETT (CONT’D)
          No sign of this manager?
                      Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                40.


                      PONDS
          Not yet.


INT. COPELAND'S HABERDASHERY / EVERETT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Everett closes the door. Crosses to his desk and picks up the
phone. His leg jack hammers the floor as he dials.

                    EVERETT
          Jesse there?

                    ELOISE (O.S.)
          Ain’t seen him. Everything okay?

                    EVERETT
          Everything’s fine.

                    ELOISE (O.S.)
          Good. I want y’all to come by for
          dinner before your little fight.

                    EVERETT
          Yes, Ma’am.

On Everett, wondering if there’s going to be a fight.

INT. ABANDONED TENEMENT - DAY

This building is beyond   fucked. Pools of stagnant water.        *
Holes in walls. Boarded   windows. Rats. Unfinished floors. Not
a place anyone wants to   hang out. No one that is, except
Jesse Copeland. He sits   on a couple of STACKED APPLE CRATES -
a picture of serenity.

A door opens and Negro Driver and another HEAVY muscle Lester
Daniels through it. He protests as they force walk him to the
middle of the floor to stand in front of Jesse.

                    JESSE
          Let him go.

They do so roughly.

                    LESTER
          Who the fuck are you supposed to
          be?

                    JESSE
          I work with Roxy.
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                41.


                    LESTER
          Well - you tell his black ass the
          fight is off. I don’t care if you
          niggas change your mind about the
          money.

                    JESSE
          I thought you might say that. And
          normally - I’m the type of Negro
          that would take exception to such
          language. I tend to just react to
          things without thinking. That’s
          what my brother tells me...

                    LESTER
          I don’t give a fuck you black
          sonuvabitch. Let me go or...

Heavy grabs Lester’s face in his MASSIVE HAND. He squeezes
Lester’s cheeks together so his lips purse and he can’t talk.   *

                    JESSE
          I already told you I don’t like
          that kind of language. ‘Sides -
          we’re just talking here. Being
          reasonable. Right? That’s how we
          solve problems. And I’ve put a lot
          of thought to this.

Jesse starts unbuttoning his shirt as he speaks.

                    JESSE (CONT’D)
          See - I think you got cold feet cuz
          you don’t think a Negro and a white
          man can have a fair fight. But
          that’s not true. See - I’m a Negro.
          You’re white. And we can have a
          fair fight. Matter of fact, we gon’
          have one - right now.

He drops his shirt revealing a WHITE TANK TEE, BUILT FRAME.
Lester mumbles something unintelligible.

                     JESSE (CONT’D)
          Sure it is. This ain’t just about
          tonight.
              (to his cronies)
          Gentlemen.

Heavy and Negro Driver step back as Jesse stalks forward. He
moves like he spent some time in the ring himself. Lester
turns to run, but Heavy and Negro Driver catch him and push
him back towards Jesse....
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                   42.


                    LESTER
          Wait...

...who throws his FIRST PUNCH. It snaps Lester’s head back
and staggers him backwards. Heavy and Negro Driver help him
keep his balance.

Jesse unleashes a vicious combination on Lester. Blood erupts
from his face. He drops to a knee. Jesse stands over him
menacing - no longer masking his rage.

                    JESSE
          Fight me, you cocksucker!

Lester raises his hand signaling mercy or something, but
Heavy and Negro Driver just stand him to his feet.

There is a look of a evil joy in Jesse’s eyes. His lips curl
into a smile as he approaches for another assault.

                    BOSKO (O.S.)
          The city’s colored are out of
          control as it is.


INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR’S OFFICE - DAY                            *

The 44th Mayor of Chicago, ANTON J. CERMAK (59), a Czech
political brawler with no formal education, sits with his
Chief of Staff, FEDIR “FREDDY” BOSKO (50s), salty, of Polish
and Ukrainian descent, sipping tea and talking.

                    BOSKO
          Giving a private audience to this
          so called Negro business-man will
          only embolden the native element.

                    CERMAK
          Three of the five wards that went
          for Thompson are on the Southside.
          Damn near 40,000 votes.

                    BOSKO
          And we still won.

                    CERMAK
          Cuz Bill Thompson is a corrupt
          sonuvabitch. In three years, the                       *
          Northside will have forgotten how                      *
          terrible the Republican                                *
          administration was. We’re gonna                        *
          need the Southside coons if we want                    *
          to hold this office.
                                                          43.


                    BOSKO
          If you say so.

                    CERMAK
          I do. So show the fucker in so we
          can get this over with.

The Chief of Staff rises and opens the door to the outer
office where Curtis Randolph sits in the waiting area across
from the Mayor’s SECRETARY. He’s been there for a while.

                    SECRETRAY
          You can head in now, Mr. Randolph.

                    RANDOLPH
          Thank you, Ma’am.

Curtis crosses into the office.

                    BOSKO
          Sorry to keep you waiting, Curtis.

There is a slight tinge in the way Bosko says his name.

                    RANDOLPH
          No problem, Freddy. Happy to
          finally have a chance to sit down
          with our Mayor and offer my
          congratulations in person.

The men shake.

                    CERMAK
          Well it is my pleasure. So good to
          finally meet you. I hear wonderful
          things about the work you’re doing
          in the community.

                    RANDOLPH
          Actually, sir - we met briefly when
          you spoke at Wendell Phillips.

                    CERMAK
          Ah. That was a great event. I do
          recall. You seemed to be one of the
          few civic leaders on the Southside
          who seemed to think I had a
          snowball’s chance of victory.

                    RANDOLPH
          I recognize that the entire city
          does not have the same political
          disposition we do.
                                                44.


                    CERMAK
          Do I take that to mean you are also
          machine loyalist?

                    RANDOLPH
          Oh contraire. I say “we” in
          acknowledgement of my particular
          constituency. I don’t cast my
          ballot out of rote. I want to forge
          alliances with those who have the
          best interest of my community at
          heart.

                    CERMAK
          And I have the best interest of all
          Chicagoans in mind at all times. So
          it is good that we speak.

                    RANDOLPH
          There is a particular issue that
          has confronted the Southside. I
          wonder if you can help.

                    CERMAK
          How can I be of service?

                     RANDOLPH
          It seems, since your election,
          there has been an inordinate and, I
          dare say, unnecessary amount of
          pressure on certain business
          interests.

                     CERMAK
          If you’re referring to my
          administration’s efforts to root
          out crime and corruption wherever
          we find it, I will remind you that
          I campaigned on a promise to do
          just that.

                    RANDOLPH
          To be clear - sporting houses are
          not my concern. And I applaud any
          attempts to curtail the violence
          associated with the Outfit. I speak
          specifically to certain non-violent
          efforts of colored entrepreneurs
          who have taken the onus of making
          capital investments in our
          district.

Cermak looks puzzled.
                                      45.


          BOSKO
He’s talking about policy.

          CERMAK
I know. I’m just....surprised.
    (to Randolph)
Curtis, you are one of the first
and only Negros to successfully
open and run a bank for coloreds in
the entire State. Maybe the
country. Why’s a man of your
relative stature here pandering for
hooligans who prey upon the most
vulnerable of your people?

          RANDOLPH
Respectfully, the men you call
hooligans are the only reason there
is any hope in our community. A
community, I’ll remind you, that
has been historically neglected and
marginalized in every possible way.

          CERMAK
Are you that desperate for
deposits?

          RANDOLPH
I beg your pardon.

          CERMAK
Let’s cut to the quick, shall we?
You want the police to lay off the
policy bankers so they can funnel
money into your “legitimate” bank.
And in exchange, you’ll deliver the
Black Belt in the next election.

           RANDOLPH
My interests are not self
motivated.

          CERMAK
Well, mine are. You see my
interests are the city’s interests.

          RANDOLPH
And mine are in supporting the
candidate that supports us.

          CERMAK
So we have an understanding?
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                  46.


                    RANDOLPH
          I understand there’s three years
          until you run again.

On Cermak, flummoxed by a Negro that sees himself as equal.


INT. ABANDONED TENEMENT - DAY                                   *

Lester Daniel’s face is SWOLLEN and BLOODY. Heavy and Negro
Driver hold the barely conscious man up as Jesse continues to
beat him. Jesse doesn’t notice the CUTS that have opened on     *
his hands.                                                      *

                    JESSE
          Say it! Say it, you miserable fuck!

Alternately striking him and taunting him to speak.

                    JESSE (CONT’D)
          We gon’ have a fair fight. Say it!

                    NEGRO DRIVER
          Jesse, man, you gon’ kill him.

                    JESSE
          Not if he smartens up.

Lester says something. But he’s so weak, no one can hear it.

                    JESSE (CONT’D)
          What’s that?

Jesse leans in close so he can hear the man’s whispers.

Lester SPITS BLOOD in Jesse’s face.

Jesse loses his shit. Beating the man so wildly, Heavy and      *
Negro Driver are forced to let go of him. They exchange looks
as the men crash to the floor and Jesse continues to pummel
the poor man.                                                   *

They grab Jesse and pull him off Lester.

                    HEAVY
          Stop, Jesse! He not gonna give.

They pull their boss a few feet away and try to calm him down
as he struggles against them.

                    NEGRO DRIVER
          Jesse, please!
                      Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                 47.


                    JESSE
          Alright, alright, alright!

He relents. They let go. All three shake it off for a beat.
Jesse finally seeming to get control of himself.

Then - quicker than either of them can react, Jesse snatches
the GUN from Negro Driver’s waist and strides back over to
Lester. He pulls him up by the HAIR and slams the barrel of
the gun to his temple.

                    JESSE (CONT’D)
          You got two seconds, mothafucka!
          One!

                    HEAVY
          Jesse, DON’T!

                      JESSE
          Two!

He SQUEEZES...

                      EVERETT (O.C)
          Go ahead.

Jesse looks up. Letting go of the trigger before it
discharges. He sees Everett standing in the doorway. His
Driver behind him holding a LEATHER SATCHEL.

                    EVERETT (CONT’D)
          Do it. Blow him away. Then what?

                    JESSE
          Then this cracka is dead. And all
          these white cocksuckas know not to
          fuck wit us.

                    EVERETT
          Cuz that’s what’s gonna happen
          right? No. Let me tell you how this
          plays out. He’s dead. The fight
          gets cancelled for sure. A bunch of
          flatfoots investigate the murder of
          a white man. On the Southside. In                      *
          this building. We all get pinched.                     *
          You get the hotsquat. Mama’s heart
          breaks. Again. Every policy bank in
          Bronzeville is shut down. No more
          dough for the legit businesses - so
          they dry up too. If they don’t just
          burn ‘em down for good measure.
          Everything we working toward goes
          down the drain. And for what?
                       Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                48.


Jesse says nothing.

                    EVERETT (CONT’D)
          Cuz you a gotdamn hothead. Cuz you
          refuse to think. Go head if it’s
          worth it to you. Let him have it.

Jesse considers his brother. The white man whose barely open
eyes still regard him with contempt.

Jesse wrestles with his bloodlust.

And drops the gun.

                    EVERETT (CONT’D)
              (to Negro Driver)
          Take him to the house.
              (to Jesse)
          Ma wants us to come for dinner.
              (to Heavy)
          Grab the roscoe. Help him sit up.

Heavy does as told. While Negro Driver walks a chastened
Jesse out past his brother. The two glare at each other.

Once Jesse is gone, Everett goes and crouches by Lester.

                    EVERETT (CONT’D)
          Find me some ice.                                      *

Heavy leaves. He pulls his SILK POCKET SQUARE out his jacket
and goes to wipe Lester’s face.

The man FLINCHES. Turns away.

                    EVERETT (CONT’D)
          I’m not gonna hurt you. Is it okay?

Lester nods. Everett gently begins to wipe the blood away.

                    EVERETT (CONT’D)
          I’m sorry about my brother. He’s...                    *

                       LESTER                                    *
          ...a fool.                                             *

WHAAAAAM - Everett SMACKS the words right out of his mouth -     *
HARD. His eyes narrow to a slit.                                 *

                    EVERETT                                      *
          My brother is my brother. You see                      *
          the bag?                                               *

Lester nods.                                                     *
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                  49.


                    EVERETT (CONT’D)
          2 G’s. For your trouble. So the
          fight goes on. You okay with that?

Lester doesn’t respond. He leans into the man. Whispers         *
something only he and the man can hear.

Lester’s face whites. Everett speaks audibly again. Still
quiet. Very calmly.

                    EVERETT (CONT’D)
          The fight goes on. You had a bad
          car accident. We ever hear
          otherwise, all bets are off. Okay?

Lester Daniels nods, more afraid than he’s ever been.


INT. COPELAND MANSION / DINING ROOM - EVENING                   *

A THICK SALVE is applied with care to the CUTS on Jesse’s
hands.

                    JESSE
          It’s nothing, Ma. Worked the heavy
          bag too hard.

Eloise sits next to him at the dining room table tending to
his hand while the ELEGANT FEAST that awaits them gets cold.

Still pissed, but trying to hide it, Jesse is careful not to
look at Everett who sits across the table also working hard
not to look at him. Instead, Everett eyes the CLOCK on the
wall. Under the table, his leg shakes like it was in the        *
office. His wife, ESTHER (26), fastidious about rules and
quiet to a fault, places a calming HAND on his THIGH to get
him to stop. She reiterates the point with her eyes.

Also at the table - Lisa, still dressed from work.

                    ELOISE
          I think you all done got too
          excited about this fight. You
          oughta know better.

                    JESSE
          It’s fine, Ma.

                    ELOISE
          No it is not fine. Where’s Ezekiel?

A BUTLER brings over a few BANDAGES and places them on the
table next to Eloise. He disappears back into the kitchen as
Eloise continues to work on Jesse’s damaged hand.
                                     50.


          EVERETT
He’s probably at the club. Making
sure everything is perfect for
tonight.

          ELOISE
I told him to be here. I figured
since I’m lettin’ you all throw
your little party...

          JESSE
He’ll be here.

             ELOISE
He’s late.

          LISA
He’s always late, Mom.

           ELOISE
Don’t sass me, girl. How was your
first day?

          LISA
With the exception of a couple
asinine customers, it
was...unremarkable.

          JESSE
Need me to talk to somebody?

          LISA
Nothing I can’t handle.

          ELOISE
How was Mr. Randolph?

          LISA
He was fine. I mostly answered the
phone. Nothing too exciting.

          JESSE
We can find something for ya.

          LISA
Oh no. I see too much of you guys
as it is. No. I’ll pay my dues at
Chicago United. Learn the business
so one day I can work at a bank
that’s not so complicated.

          JESSE
What’s complicated about holding
people’s money?
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                51.


                    EVERETT
          She thinks giving people something
          to hope for is exploitative.

                    LISA
          Policy is not hope.

                    EVERETT
          That’s where you’re wrong, little                   *
          sister.                                             *

                    ELOISE
          Enough. The important thing right
          now is that this family is together
          to celebrate my LiLi getting her                    *
          business degree and using it. I am
          so proud of you.
              (a little emotional)
          God...I wish your father was here.

She casts a look toward the EMPTY CHAIR at the head of the
table. Jesse places a tender hand on his mother’s back.

                    ELOISE (CONT’D)
          I’m okay, baby.

                    ZEKE (O.S.)
          Where’s the next president of
          Chicago United Savings and Loan!?

Zeke saunters in holding a BOUQUET. He wraps Lisa in a hug.

                    ZEKE (CONT’D)
          I heard deposits was up 100 large
          today!

                    LISA
              (laughing)
          You a fool, boy.

                    ELOISE
          Ezekiel Marcellus Copeland. You
          supposed to be here 30 minutes ago.

He breaks the hug with Lisa. Heads over to his mother,
cheshire stitched to his face. He presents her the bouquet
with a flourish. Jesse rolls his eyes.

                    ZEKE
          It takes time to hand pick roses.

                     LISA
          Nothing for the bank’s next
          president?
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                 52.


He playfully shushes her, roses still extended to Eloise.

                    JESSE
          He’s conning you, Ma.

She takes them, charmed - despite herself.

                    ELOISE
          I know. But they’ll look lovely on
          the table. Where’s Hazel?

                    JESSE
          Left her to finish at the club.
          She’ll be this way before long.

                    ELOISE
          Again? We’ll wait.                                    *

           EVERETT                            JESSE             *
We need to be gettin’ to the      Ma. We got a lot riding on
arena before...                   this fight...

                    ELOISE
          Hush. I insist.

                    LISA
          Please, Ma. Not on account of me.

                    ELOISE
          What I say?

Silence from all. She stands and heads to the kitchen.

                    ELOISE (CONT’D)
          Everett, come help me find a vase
          for these flowers.

                    ESTHER
          I’ll help you, Ms. Eloise.

                    EVERETT
          I got it, babe.

As Everett follows his Mom through the door into...


INT. COPELAND MANSION / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

....modern and very well appointed kitchen. She instructs the
Butler who is waiting there.
                                                           53.


                    ELOISE
          Renfro, be a dear and run the capon
          back in the oven for me. Dinner’ll
          be a little while.

                    BUTLER
          Yessum.

He heads into the dining room as Eloise starts opening
cabinets from the BUTLER’S PANTRY looking for the right vase.

                    EVERETT
          Do we really have to wait for
          Hazel? I don’t want to be late.

                    ELOISE
          Neither does Jesse. Looks like
          that’s the only thing y’all can
          agree on.

                    EVERETT
          We didn’t say...

                    ELOISE
          You think I can’t see, boy? Heavy
          bag. I don’t believe that
          foolishness for one minute. You
          need to work out whatever’s going
          on between the two of you.

                    EVERETT
          That’s not fair, Ma. Why’s it on
          me?

                    ELOISE
          Because you don’t think with your
          heart. And I’m not gonna be around
          to play peacemaker forever.

She places the flowers in a vase and splays them out for
Everett to admire.

                    ELOISE (CONT’D)
          See. Beautiful.

On Everett, as Eloise returns to the dining room.


INT. RAINBO FRONTON - NIGHT

WHAAAAAM!!!!

BEADS OF SWEAT leap off a Joe Louis’s FACE as a LEATHER
BOXING MITT SMASHES into it.
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                54.


The man wearing the mitt, DEWEY SANDERS, (26) white,
muscular, several pounds heavier and more experienced than
Joe stalks forward.

Several BANNERS touting CHICAGO GOLDEN GLOVES are strung up
around the space. They’re in Fred Mann’s Rainbo Fronten. The
giant SMOKE FILLED ROOM is electric. Negroes and whites alike   *
cheer the sweet science.                                        *

                    SPECTATOR
          Kill the black bastard!

                    SPECTATOR 2
          Who told this monkey he could
          fight!?

The two warriors battle.

Everett, Jesse and Zeke, now dressed the dashing peacock,
squeeze through the crowd and find their seats awaiting them
in the front next to Lucky and Roxy.

                    LUCKY
          That’s right, Joe!

                    ROXY
          Finish him!
              (to Everett)
          Nice of you guys to show up.

          How we doing?

INT. THE ROYALE - LATER

POP! A CHAMPAGNE CORK FLIES.

Followed by raucous CHEERS from the Southside’s BEST DRESSED
and MOST GLAMOROUS, practically all of whom seem to have
gathered at The Royale, the Copeland Brothers’ legendary
night club in the heart of The Stroll. It is larger and more    *
tastefully expensive than anyone could imagine for a club       *
owned by Negroes in 1932.                                       *
                       Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                55.


The Brothers are there, as well as Curtis Randolph, Roxy,
Lucky Smith, a number of OTHER POLICY KINGS, their WIVES and     *
MISTRESSES as well as OTHER LADIES, HUSTLERS, GAMBLERS,
ENTREPRENEURS, CRIMINALS, and SQUARES too. As long as they
look good and have some dollars to spend - they are among.

A band, WALTER BARNES AND HIS CREOLIANS, plays on stage.

Zeke Copeland takes the floor, OVERFLOWING CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE
in hand. Several WAITERS top off those who are in need.

                    ZEKE
          If you don’t know him now, you gon’
          know him soon. And so will the
          whole world. Lift your glasses for
          the next champ - MR. JOE LOUIS!!!

Everybody cheers. Roxy nudges Joe who attempts to speak. But
the crowd is too loud. Zeke notices and simmers the crowd.

                    ZEKE (CONT’D)
          C’mon, yall. Joe got somethin’ to
          say.

                    JOE
              (stammering slightly)
          I just want to thank Roxy for
          bringing me out here to compete in
          the Golden Gloves. And the Copeland
          Brothers for hosting this
          celebration. Believing in me.

                    LUCKY
          A lot of us believe in you, Joe.

                     JOE
          My thanks to you too, suh. And all
          the Kings!

Those gathered around the bar erupt in spontaneous cheers.

NEAR THE FRONT DOORS

Jimmy, dressed better than before, but clearly working with a
limited budget, walks in with Casper. His eyes saucer at the
sight of the place; Negroes looking fabulous and dressed to
the 9’s.

                    JIMMY
          I done died and gone to Negro
          Heaven.
                        Blue Rev. (10/24/20)            56.


                    CASPER
              (laughing)
          Heaven’s later. When we find you a
          lady. C’mon, let’s get you a drink.

                    JIMMY                                      *
          They own this too...?                                *

The two blend into the mass of people, just missing Better
Offer as he heads over to Zeke who stands with MRS. HAZEL
COPELAND (30.) She is stunning, a star in her own right,
named for her eyes. Better Offer, shadowed as always by his
Large Man, introduces himself.

                    BETTER OFFER
          Zeke, you told me your wife was
          stunning, but I don’t think you do
          her justice.

                    HAZEL
          You flatter me, Mister...?

She extends her hand which he takes and kisses.

                    BETTER OFFER
          Barnes. But you can call me Better
          Offer.

                    ZEKE
          Hazel, baby - Frank and I got to
          see a man about a horse. Why don’t
          you go bless Walter and the boys.

                    HAZEL
          Sure thing. Nice to meet you, Mr.
          Offer.

They watch her head over to the band stand.

                    ZEKE
          Real classy.

They heads toward the back of the club, not noticing Everett
clocking the whole interaction from across the room. He’s
talking to Jesse and Randolph. Jesse’s got a few in him.

                    RANDOLPH
          You guys alright?

              EVERETT                          JESSE           *
We’re good.                        Yes, sir.
                     Blue Rev. (10/24/20)         57.


                    RANDOLPH
          Alright. Good. I told Anna I
          wouldn’t stay long, but I wanted to
          congratulate you both. Relax. Have
          a good time. You’re on your way.

                    JESSE
          We not goin’ anywhere without you.

                    RANDOLPH
          Well. I appreciate that. But
          Eyeball’s retired. You guys have a
          good night. I’m gonna check on
          Lucky.

He excuses himself. Goes over to talk to Lucky.

                    EVERETT                             *
          You know we just closed on that               *
          building.                                     *

                    EVERETT                             *
          That’s what this is all about? I              *
          don’t tell you enough.                        *

                    JESSE                               *
          I’m supposed to know everything. We           *
          just closed on that building.                 *

                    EVERETT                             *
          Thought you were focused on where             *
          we need muscle.                               *

                    JESSE                               *
          We need muscle everywhere.                    *

                    EVERETT
          No we don’t. That’s the whole point           *
          of branching out. Legit businesses.           *

                    JESSE                               *
          You’re naive, big brother.                    *

          I’m not. I know policy will always            *
          be the engine of everything. But we           *
          need to diversify. Not just what,             *
          but how we do business.                       *
                      Blue Rev. (10/24/20)              58.


                    JESSE
          Maybe I oughta start my own wheel.
          Shit I was runnin’ numbers before
          you anyway.

                    EVERETT
          Is that what you really want?

                    JESSE
          What difference it make to you?

                    EVERETT
          Look, man. I know I can be stubborn
          sometimes. That’s the way we was
          both raised. But never for a second
          - have I thought I could do any of
          this without you. Remember - it was
          me that asked you for help. And
          look at what we done together so
          far. Five years ago, nobody coulda
          imagined a club this big on The
          Stroll. A legit bank. Property.
          That’s why cats like Better Offer
          and Denver Ferguson are always
          comin’ to town. To see what we got
          goin’ in Chicago. They wanna be us.
          Not Everett. Not Jesse. Us.

                    JESSE
          Don’t forget Bro-Bro.                               *

                    EVERETT
          Course not. Zeke built this club.

Jesse looks out at the sea of Brown. Laughing, drinking,
celebrating, free. In their own club. Hazel has now joined
the band on stage. She joins them in a vocal rendition of
“Birmingham Bertha.”

                    JESSE
          He sure knows how to throw a party.

                    EVERETT
          We all play our part. And this just
          the beginning. If we stick
          together.

He raises his glass. A beat. Jesse clinks. Spies Zeke         *
emerging from a back corridor with Better Offer.

                      EVERETT (CONT’D)
          We tight?
                       Blue Rev. (10/24/20)             59.

          I need to tell that mothafucka to                     *
          leave our little brother alone?                       *

          Good idea.                                            *

He steps off to go talk to Zeke just as Casper arrives with
Jimmy Tillman in tow.

                    CASPER
          Boss? Got somebody I want you to
          meet. This Jimmy. Got some talents
          I think you’ll appreciate.

Everett glad hands his way through the club and catches up
with Zeke who has already parted ways with Better Offer. He
throws an arm around his little brother’s shoulders - walking
with him in a tight embrace.

Zeke plays cool, but is visibly unnerved.

                    EVERETT
          Great party, little brother.

                    ZEKE
          Great fight, Ev.

                    EVERETT
          I see you beating your gums with
          Better Offer.

                    ZEKE
          Just catching up is all.

                     EVERETT
          Hope so. You know St. Louis no
          different than Chicago as far as we
          concerned.
                                                        60.


                       ZEKE
             I know. Don’t worry.

                       EVERETT
             Good. I’d hate to get Jesse all
             riled up again.

                       ZEKE
             Believe me - nobody wants that.

                       JESSE (O.C.)
             Fuck ya’ll talkin’ about.

Zeke smiles- silently pleading with his eyes to Everett as
Jesse throws his arms around both his brothers.

                       EVERETT
             Just how amazing Hazel is.

                       JESSE
             I think we can all agree about
             that.

The brothers watch the performance - sincerely mesmerized.


FRONT DOORS

Fashionably late and ravishing in a RED DRESS, Lisa saunters
into the club. The MAITRE’D practically curtsies when he
greets her.

                       MAITRE’D
             Good evening, Ms. Copeland.

Casper SLAMS A SHOT on the stick and motions for another
while Jimmy is still holding his, watching him.

                    JIMMY
          You alright?

                    CASPER
          I’m fine. I gets a bit ancy
          whenever I talk to the boss.

                    JIMMY
          I appreciate the introduction.

                    CASPER
          Don’t mention it. Jesse handles the                    *
          business end of the business - if                      *
          you know what I’m sayin’. It ain’t                     *
          lost on me how quick you was to
          step to my defense today.

                    JIMMY
          Everybody needs a friend in
          Chicago.

Casper laughs as he eyes the room.

                    CASPER
          Speaking of Negro Heaven...

                    JIMMY
          I’m all for it. These last few days
          been...

                     CASPER
          Woo-wee!

Further down the bar, Casper sees a WOMAN IN A SHORT DRESS
revealing beautiful, statuesque legs.

                    CASPER (CONT’D)
          Now that’s about my speed. She got
          legs just like I like ‘em.

                    JIMMY
          How’s that?

                    CASPER
          Feet on the bottom. Pussy on top.

                    JIMMY
          You crazy, man.

Jimmy shakes his head as he scans for his own target. His
eyes land on Lisa Copeland. Still hemmed up by Better Offer.
                       Blue Rev. (10/24/20)              62.


                    JIMMY (CONT’D)
          I think I found my salvation.

                    CASPER
          Best keep lookin’, Jimmy. Talkin’
          to that one there’ll get you to
          heaven fo’ real.

                    JIMMY
          The old man don’t seem to know
          that.

                    CASPER
          Ain’t nobody stuttin’ him. Better
          Offer a 2nd rate King from a 2nd

          That’s...?

                    CASPER
          Baby sister.

                    JIMMY
          All the more reason to help her
          out.                                                 *

                    CASPER
          Fool, I introduced you.

                    JIMMY
          Don’t worry. I’m not screwing up my                  *

          Brothers for nothin.                                 *

Jimmy peels off with his drink. Casper, nervous, slams         *
another one and signals for two more.

Jimmy crosses to Lisa and Better Offer.

                    JIMMY (CONT’D)
          Pardon me, Old Timer.
              (to Lisa)
          Here’s your drink, baby. Just like
          you like it.

                    BETTER OFFER
          You know this guy?

                    JIMMY
          Of course, she do.

                    LISA
          Actually I don’t. I’ve never had
          the occasion to go to Mississippi.

                      JIMMY
          Arkansas.

                    LISA
          I figured you were from somewhere
          where they ain’t got no home
          training.

                    JIMMY
          Pardon me, ma’am. Just looked like
          you needed some help.

                    LISA
          Not from the likes of you.

                    BETTER OFFER
          You want me to take this clown
          outside, Lisa?

                    LISA
          I don’t need help from you either,
          Mr. Barnes. If you all need to
          prove your manhood to each other,
          be my guest. Good evening.

She walks away. Jimmy watches after her - somehow more
intrigued. Better Offer steps into his field of view.

                    BETTER OFFER
          You best mind your eyeballs.

                    JIMMY
          You best get the fuck up out my
          face.

Across the room, Ponds rushes over to Everett looking
harried.

                    PONDS
          Just got word. Police done raided
          the Indianapolis, Carolina and
          Memphis wheels.

                      EVERETT
          What!?

But before he can process that, he turns toward the rising
commotion coming from Jimmy and Better Offer.
                    Blue Rev. (10/24/20)                   64.


                    EVERETT (CONT’D)
          What the fuck is going on?

The Brothers look and see the men step to each other. Casper     *
hurries over. Large Man reaches into his waist band. Jesse       *
starts to move toward the fracas when suddenly...                *

BOOM!!!

The FRONT DOORS of the club are kicked in. Dozens of
UNIFORMED COPS pour through the doors brandishing their
SERVICE WEAPONS.

The music stops. EVERYBODY looks toward the commotion -
including The Brothers. And Randolph from the bar.

Jimmy and Better Offer separate. Large Man quickly untucks
his hand. BUTTONS his JACKET.

                    COPS
          Everybody FREEZE where you are!
          DON’T FUCKING MOVE!

The Cops disperse through the crowd, roughly searching for
someone or something.

Into the center of the officers walks OFFICER SYLVESTER “TWO
GUN PETE” WASHINGTON (27), a heavy, mean and imposing man
whose reputation as beyond brutal is already well on its way
to legend.

                    2 GUN PETE
          Alright, everybody! Wagon’s here!                      *

At the sight of him, several hustlers among the crowd begin
to voluntarily lay their WEAPONS on the nearest bars and
tables. Everybody puts down their DRINKS.

                    EVERETT
              (to Jesse)
          Lay it down.

                    JESSE
          What the fuck is he doing here?

                    EVERETT
          I don’t know. Just lay it down.

Jesse pulls his BROWNING HI-POWER slowly. Opens The action.
Puts it on the ground.

Jimmy whispers to Casper who has saddled up next to him.
                                                           65.


                    JIMMY
          Who the hell is that?

                    CASPER
          2 Gun Pete. Don’t make no sudden
          moves. Prefers shooting niggas to
          arresting ‘em. Less paperwork.

On 2 Gun Pete.

                    2 GUN PETE
          Since y’all being so cooperative.
          We just taking three of you
          tonight. Everett Copeland, Jesse
          Copeland and Zeke. You all under
          arrest.

An audible gasp spreads through the crowd. This is not
business as usual.

Three UNIFORMS put the Copeland Brothers in HANDCUFFS and
walk them through the crowd toward the front doors of the
club. Another retrieves Jesse’s pistol from the floor. They
stop by 2 Gun Pete.

                    EVERETT
          I thought we had an understanding.

                    2 GUN PETE
          New mayor, new rules.

Randolph approaches.

                    RANDOLPH
          What’s the meaning of this? They
          haven’t done anything.

                    2 GUN PETE
          Anton Cermak says otherwise. Take
          it up with him.

                    RANDOLPH
          I will. What’s the charge?

                    2 GUN PETE
          Besides being Black and ugly -
          attempted murder. Name Lester
          Daniels mean anything to you?

Randolph is surprised. He looks to Everett and Jesse who
exchange looks.

          Let’s go.
              (to the room)
          You have a good evening now!

Randolph watches pissed as 2 Gun Pete parades the Copeland
Brothers out the door of their own club...


EXT. THE ROYALE - CONTINUOUS

...and into an awaiting PADDY WAGON for all of State Street
to see.

This particular block near the corner of 37th & State is the
heart of the Black Belt. But the heart stops beating for the
moment, as EVERYBODY on the street watches their Southside
Royalty herded like common criminals.


I/E. THE ROYALE - CONTINUOUS

The party is over. Everyone stunned, disbelieving. Most of
all, Randolph.

Better Offer slides up behind Lisa who is still processing
the whole thing.
