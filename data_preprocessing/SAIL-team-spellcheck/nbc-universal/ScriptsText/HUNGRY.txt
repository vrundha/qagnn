INT. LOS ANGELES - CAR - NIGHT

Close on Teddy grooving to an upbeat, empowering song.


EXT. DRIVE-THRU RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Reveal that she is in her car at a fast food restaurant order
box. She turns off the music and rolls down the window.

                    ORDER GUY (O.C.)
          Hi, can I take your order, please?

                     TEDDY
          Yes, I’ll have the number three.
              (firmly)
          Only, no cheese.
              (then)
          Actually, can I get the cheese on
          the side?

A beat.

                     ORDER GUY (O.C.)
          How?

                    TEDDY
          Never mind, leave it.

                    ORDER GUY (O.C.)
          Okay, number three. Do you want
          fries with that?

Teddy turns to camera.

                    TEDDY
          Is there a stupider question? Of
          course I want fries with that. Who
          doesn’t want fries with everything?
              (then, to box)
          No fries.

                    ORDER GUY (O.C.)
          But don’t you deserve it? You’ve
          been really good lately.

                     TEDDY
          Whoa.   How do you know that?
                                                        2.


                    ORDER GUY (O.C.)
          I don’t. It’s what you told me to
          say the last time you were here.

Teddy glances at the camera, yeah, did do that.

                    TEDDY
          Thing is, I want like three fries.

                    ORDER GUY
          So throw the rest out.

                    TEDDY
          Dude, so wasteful--

SFX: Phone text sound.

Teddy glances at it. It’s a text from “James.” Her
background photo is a picture of she and James (30s, so
handsome). It reads: “where are you?” Teddy texts back:
“gym” James: “good girl”

                    TEDDY (CONT'D)
              (to camera)
          I still might go.


INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Lisa (50s, never at her ideal weight) is smudging in liner as
she watches a YouTube tutorial on mastering the smokey eye.
One eye is garishly made up. From the laptop we hear:

                    GLOTTAL FRY VOICE (V.O.)
          ...and the great thing is this look
          looks great on everyone.

She picks up her phone.


INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                     TEDDY
              (to box)
          Look, you know how when you take
          everything out of the big bag
          there’s always a few renegade fries
          at the bottom? I just want the
          ones that would have escaped on
          their own.

SFX: Phone FaceTime chime.   Teddy glances at it: MOM
                                                3.


                    ORDER GUY (O.C.)
          You need to get that?

                    TEDDY
          It’s just my mom.

                    ORDER GUY (O.C.)
          My mom died a few years ago. I
          wish I could take calls from her.

                    TEDDY
          Okay, fine.
              (answers phone)
          Hi Mom.
              (then, to box)
          And no fries.

                     LISA
          What?

                     TEDDY
          Not you.

SFX: Car honking behind her.

                    TEDDY (CONT'D)
              (to car)
          Why be a dick?

                     LISA
          What?

                     TEDDY
          Not you!
              (then, noticing)
          Mom, enough with the smokey eye
          tutorials.

                    LISA
          But this one was for mature eyes, I
          couldn’t resist.

                    TEDDY
          Repeat after me: no one masters the
          smokey eye. What’s up?

                    LISA
          I joined a new support group and I
          need you to come with me.

                     TEDDY
          Why?
                                                      4.


                    LISA
          To support me.

                    TEDDY
          Isn’t that what the group is for?

                    LISA
          It’ll be my birthday present.

                    TEDDY
          Can’t I just get you a candle?

                    LISA
          You can do that, too. Something
          that smells like cookies, but not
          in a way that makes me want
          cookies, in a way that makes me
          feel like I’m already eating
          cookies.

Teddy is now at the window. The Order Guy (20s, gives off
nothing) hands her the food.

                    ORDER GUY
          Here you go.

                    LISA
          Who’s that? Please tell me you’re
          on a date with someone new.

                    TEDDY
          Not on a date.

                    ORDER GUY
          You could be. I get off soon.

                    LISA
          He sounds nice.     Let me see him.

                      TEDDY
          Bye, mom.


INT. HIKING TRAIL - DAY - NEXT DAY

Lisa and Teddy hike up a canyon trail, both out of breath.

                     LISA
          I think they meet at the top of
          this hill.

                    TEDDY
          You said that about the last one.
                                                      5.


                    LISA
          This group is going to finally get
          my food stuff under control.

                    TEDDY
          You said that about the last one.

                    LISA
          It’s only been around a few months,
          very non-judgemental.

                    TEDDY
          Well, that’s good.

                    WEDNESDAY (O.C.)
          On your left!

Wednesday (28-35, super fit) zips past in skin-tight gear.

                    TEDDY
              (imitating her)
          On your left! Look at me.

                      LISA
          Hate her.

                      TEDDY
          Me, too.

                    LISA
          Anyway, it’s very non-judgemental.

                    TEDDY
          Super important.

                    LISA
          Especially with women. Y’know,
          this group could be good for you
          too, Teddy. Men come, you could
          meet someone.

                    TEDDY
          I have someone.

                    LISA
          He doesn’t count as a someone.
          He’s married.

                    TEDDY
          No, he’s divorced... in every way
          except he’s still married. In
          fact... Tonight is our anniversary.
          And he likes it when I’m bold. So.
          I’m. Going to propose.
                                                      6.


                    LISA
          You’re going to propose?

                    TEDDY
          Mom, women propose. It’s so not a
          big deal.
              (to camera)
          It’s a huge deal. I’m so nervous.
          Do women propose?

                    LISA
          It’s not because you’re a woman.
          It’s because he’s married.

                     TEDDY
          The divorce is this close to being
          finalized.

                    LISA
          Do you want me to respond as your
          mother or your friend?

                       TEDDY
          Neither.

                    LISA
          Well, both of us think it’s a
          terrible idea. Honey, even if he
          weren’t married I wouldn’t like
          him. He’s controlling and
          critical.

                    TEDDY
          He just wants me to be the best I
          can be.


INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Teddy and James are in bed, very close to the finish line.

                    TEDDY
              (moaning)
          You and me... are so good together.

                       JAMES
          You and I.

                    TEDDY
          Mmmmm.... yeah.

                    JAMES
              (still thrusting)
          No, you said you and me.
                    (MORE)
                                                      7.

                    JAMES (CONT'D)
              (as he’s coming, words
               strained)
          “I” is a subject pronoun and “me”
          is an object pronoun.

                    TEDDY
              (to camera)
          Yeah, I know. But look at him.


EXT. HIKING TRAIL - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS

Lisa and Teddy reach the bluff where the group is gathered.
There are about fifteen people of various ages and sizes.

                    LISA
          Oh, thank God. I’m not the oldest
          of the biggest one here.
              (then, nudging Teddy)
          “On your left” girl.

                    TEDDY
          What’s she doing here?

They watch as Wednesday takes out a pouch of almonds, eats
one and puts it away.

                    TEDDY (CONT'D)
              (to camera)
          One almond. What kind of freak
          just eats one almond?

Jared (28-35, a specimen) approaches.

                    JARED
          Welcome, ladies.   I’m Jared.

                    TEDDY
              (to camera, lowering
               imaginary sunglasses)
          Damnnn.

                    JARED
          We’ll start in a few.    Stoked to
          have you.

Lisa and Teddy melt as they babble non-words. Linus (28-35,
a bear but doesn’t want to be), chatting with Nicole (28-35,
proudly big) and Cooper (28-35, a little chubby), notices
them.

                    LINUS
          Hey, perfectly arched brows.     Over
          here.
                                                8.


Lisa and Teddy look at each other.

                    LINUS (CONT'D)
          Both of you. It’s clearly genetic
          gold.

Lisa and Teddy cross over.

                    LINUS (CONT'D)
              (re: Teddy’s look)
          First off... This is all snatched.
          Love me a peeky mesh moment.
          So, what brings us?

                    TEDDY
          I’m just here because of my mother.

                    LINUS
          Aren’t we all?
              (to Lisa)
          No offense.

                    LISA
          None taken. My mom did a number on
          me. But Teddy and I, we’re like
          the Gilmore Girls.

                    TEDDY
          Yeah, but like ten years later,
          which would have been sad.

                    LISA
          What about the Gilmore Girls
          reunion?

                    TEDDY
          That was sad.

                    LISA
          But we watched it.

                    LINUS
          So you’re sad. But watchable.

                    NICOLE
          I can’t even tell my mother I’m
          here. Or my boyfriend. Every time
          I say I want to eat better he’s all
          “You better not lose that sweetness
          down below.”
              (re: Cooper)
          Look how squirmy that makes him.
                                                       9.


                    COOPER
          I’m not squirmy.

                    LINUS
          You should see how he gets when we
          talk about dicks.

                    COOPER
              (matter-of-factly)
          There’s a lot of dick talk.

                    LINUS
              (re: Cooper)
          So obviously straight.   No offense.

                    COOPER
          Not sure why that’s offensive.

                    LINUS
          And there’s your privilege showing.

                    LISA
              (to Teddy)
          How FUN are they?

                    JARED
              (calling out)
          Hey everyone, Danny’s running late,
          but let’s get started.

Everyone takes a seat.   Teddy sits between Cooper and Lisa.

                    JARED (CONT'D)
          For my newbies, this is not a
          weight loss group, it’s a food
          issues group. I am not a doctor or
          an eating disorder specialist so if
          you need that, this is not for you.
          But if you want to break bad habits
          and change your body, or break bad
          thinking and change the way you see
          your body, this method will set you
          free. And that’s why I named it
          The Free Method.

                    TEDDY
              (raising hand)
          But it’s not free of charge.

                    JARED
          No.

                    TEDDY
          But doesn’t that get kind of confu--
                                                     10.


                    JARED
          Look, I already bought the URL.
          Plus, it worked for me. I used to
          weigh four hundred big ones. It’s
          all about turning Negativity into
          Positivity.

Everyone nods like that was profound.

                    COOPER
              (under his breath)
          He said nothing.

Teddy stifles a GIGGLE, which pleases Cooper. Danny (28-35,
John Candy big) arrives, out of breath, wearing a dark suit.

                    DANNY
          Sorry I’m late. Funeral.

                    LISA
          Oh, I’m so sorry.

                    DANNY
          Don’t be. I’m a funeral director.

          Wait, I know you. You had that
          morning cooking show.

                    LISA
          Oh, that was a long time ago.   You
          must have been a teenager.

                    DANNY
              (with meaning)
          Oh, I was a teenager.    The way you
          pounded that veal...

              (to Teddy)
          So cute. And nice.    Maybe he’s
          single.

                    COOPER
          I’m here because my fiancee signed
          me up.

                    LISA

          Maybe he has a brother.

Teddy looks to the camera for help.

          She bought me a size thirty-two
          wedding tuxedo. What grown man has
          a thirty-two inch waist?

                 (rising, waves)
             Hi. Wednesday. I joined the group
             because A. It’s exactly ten
             thousand steps from my house so I
             know I’ll get in double steps that
             day and B. I really want to stop
             obsessing about things like steps.
             I have been diagnosed with
             Orthorexia Nervosa which is a
             compulsive preoccupation with pure
             foods - a real thing, so... but I
             think it might be driving my
             husband crazy. Not that he doesn’t
             love me. I know he’s proud to have
             me on his arm. And if that makes
             me a trophy wife, is that such a
             bad thing?

                       LISA
                 (to self)
             Always wanted to be a trophy wife.

             My role model.

                        WEDNESDAY
             I mean, don’t we like trophies?
             How come we’re supposed to respect
             sex workers but not trophy wives?
                 (then, slight curtsy)
             Thank you.

             I will go next. Linus. I spent my
             childhood being sent to either pray
             the weight away or pray the gay

                       LINUS (CONT'D)
             Today. Recently went through a
             breakup with the love of my life.
             I got played harder than ‘Uptown
             Funk’ in 2015. And now I’m here
             because I want to be the
             heartbreaker. Payback is a bitch
             and she is a skinny bitch.

Lisa claps, then notices she’s the only one.

                       LISA
             Oh, was I not supposed to clap
             that? I just relate. I’ve been
             trying to lose weight for decades
             to get back at my ex.

                       TEDDY
                 (to camera)
             That’s been fun.

                       LISA
                 (to Jared)
             Okay if I talk?

              JARED                              DANNY
Of course.                        Please.

                       LISA
             Well, I’m Lisa. And I’m here
             because I really want this to work.
             And I do want to be more positive.
             But the truth is, I’ve lost and
             gained the same thirty pounds for
             thirty years and now, at my age,
             even if I do lose it for good my
             skin will just hang. Honestly I
             probably look better naked like
             this, but in order to attract a man
             to see me naked I’ve got to look
             better in clothes. And don’t say
             “work out” because that doesn’t
             lift skin so, what, now I’m
             supposed to eat right and work out
             so I can feel better but not look
             better? That’s some fucked up
             bullshit right there!
                 (then, sweetly)
             But I am trying to be more
             positive.

                       JARED
             Awesome share, Lisa. And how about

          That’s okay, I’m just here for my
          mom.

          But you’re signed up for the next
          six months.

          Wait... what?

                    LISA
          It’s a gift.

                    TEDDY
          But I don’t want it.
              (to group)
          Or need it. I’m good.   I’m happy.

                    LISA
          Well, that’s what she says.

                    TEDDY
          I say it because it’s true.

                    LISA
          She dates men who are all wrong for
          her, she sneaks food at night. And
          I know because when I go to sneak
          it? Gone.

                    TEDDY
          Mom, that’s enough.

                    LISA
          Sometimes I hear her crying--

                    TEDDY
          Mom, please stop talking.

                    LISA
              (to group)
          Maybe you can get her to open up.

“Let it out.”, “I just spilled my guts.” etc.

          I like food so I eat it and then I

          eat ‘cause I’m sad and then the
          whole thing starts all over again
          and I’m filled with so much shame
          and self-loathing I can’t stand it?
               (then, to group, upbeat)
          I’m good, y’all. And all this
          sharing stuff? Not for me. And
          honestly, don’t think it works. It
          certainly has not worked for my
          mom.

                    LISA
          But this one’s different.

                     TEDDY
          They’re all different. I can’t
          even count the number of groups and
          programs you’ve joined that you
          thought were the one.
               (to camera)
          Twenty-two. I counted.
               (then, to group)
          So... just gonna leave. Very big
          night tonight. But not gonna share
          why.

As Teddy walks away Wednesday gets a text: “Late night, don’t
wait up.” We see from the background photo that Wednesday’s
husband is Teddy’s boyfriend James.

Close on Teddy’s hands stacking pancakes on a plate with
cardboard in between as she practices her proposal.

          pancakes.

          Yeah, still wanna eat it.

As she snaps some photos:

                    TEDDY (CONT'D)
          She signed me up. How can I even
          think about proposing when I’m so
          mad at her? No boundaries... When
          is it going to end with her?
              (sighs)
          I guess it doesn’t end until I make
          it end. And I need to do it in

          Survivor together.

                    LISA
          I opened up the restaurant early
          for them. Everyone was peckish
          after the meeting - you know how it

          I’m in the middle of some work.

                    LISA
          Teddy is a very talented food
          stylist. Those deli sandwiches in
          Mrs. Maisel? All her.

Everyone reacts: “That’s you?!”, “Major.”   They applaud.

                    TEDDY
          Wow, thanks. Well, gotta get back.

                    NICOLE
          That’s right, you’ve got that
          “mysterious big night.”

They AD-LIB goodbyes as Teddy heads out but she hangs behind
the kitchen door to overhear:

          Okay, new category: Best Chain

                    COOPER
          Don’t jump down my throat, but my
          choice is Olive Garden’s bread
          sticks.

          I’m sorry, Cooper, but is our
          outrage on Timothy Olyphant’s IMDB
          page? Because it is justified.

                    NICOLE
          The only way an Olive Garden bread
          stick is getting inside of me is if
          I’m too lazy to get my dildo.
              (off Cooper’s reaction)
          Look at him.

                    COOPER
          I’m sorry, I didn’t grow up with
          sisters.

Angle on: Teddy stifling a giggle.

                    WEDNESDAY
          I’m finding all this talk about
          bread triggering.

                    NICOLE
          You know what I find triggering?
          People who say “triggering.”
          Me? I like a Texas Roadhouse roll.

                    LINUS
          Nah you don’t. You like the
          cinnamon butter it comes with.
          I’d eat my arm if that was on it.

                    DANNY
          Cracker Barrel’s got a good basket.
          Cornbread and biscuits. It’s an
          older crowd, but I don’t mind
          feeling young and sexy. And I like
          waiting in a rocking chair.

                    LINUS
          Yes. But. There can only be one
          best and that is... Cheesecake
          Factory’s Brown Bread. End of
          discussion. Fight me.

Everyone AD-LIBS agreement: “Doughy.”, “Sweet.”, “Like eating
a hug.” Teddy listens, then can’t resist and storms back.

          What is wrong with all y’all? It’s
          Red Lobster’s Cheddar Bay Biscuits!
          Made from scratch, brushed with
          scampi butter.

          NICOLE
Oh-kay now we talking.   That shit
is legit delicious.

          DANNY
    (sign of the cross)
Cheese. Bread. Butter.    Amen.

          LINUS
    (indicating Teddy)
The winner.

          LISA
More wine anyone?

          LINUS
Sure, I’m currently without
employment.

           COOPER
And I’m off duty.
    (to Teddy)
I’m a cop.

          TEDDY
You’re a cop?

          COOPER
I wish once someone wouldn’t say it
that way. Just...
    (casually)
“Oh, you’re a cop.” Not “You’re a
cop?” I work for the Jumper Squad.
Talk people off ledges, bridges.

           TEDDY
Wow.   How do you keep them from...

          COOPER
Believe it or not, sometimes pizza.
Even people on ledges hesitate if
you offer them a slice. It’s all
about keeping them talking, finding
that moment when they seem open to
help. We call it “The Grab.”

          DANNY
Keeping people alive, dude. That’s
taking money out of my pocket.

           LINUS
And it makes me want another slice.
    (then)
           (MORE)
                                                        21.

                     LINUS (CONT'D)
          And now I hear Jared’s voice saying
          I’m just justifying and excusing.
              (then)
          Screw it, I’ll just move to the
          south where I’ll be thin.

                    NICOLE
          But then you’re a gay man in the
          south.

                    LINUS
          Oy. Sometimes I think we need to
          Marie Condo this country. Does
          West Virginia really spark joy?

                    TEDDY
              (laughs, then)
          Hey guys, sorry for earlier on the
          mountain. Just not big on the
          whole sharing personal stuff thing.

                    LISA
              (under breath)
          Something the group could really
          help you with.

                    TEDDY
              (under breath)
          Mom...

Lisa mimes zipping her lip and throwing away the key.

                    TEDDY (CONT'D)
              (to camera)
          She always finds that key.
              (then, to group)
          Will you apologize to Jared for me?

                    NICOLE
          Oh, he’s not mad, he asked us to
          get your number.

                    TEDDY
              (flattered)
          He did?
              (then, to Lisa)
          But you told him I was with
          someone, right?

                    LISA
          I did, but the group discussed it
          and we decided you could do better.
                                                     22.


                       TEDDY
          What?

                    NICOLE
          Unless, how good is the dick?
          Hard to break up with good dick.
          Even if he’s married.

Cooper makes a face.

                    TEDDY
              (to Lisa)
          You told them that?

                    LISA
              (re: group)
          We have no secrets.

                    TEDDY
              (seething)
          You met them. Today.

                    COOPER
          Uh... Maybe we should give you guys
          your space.

The others rise, AD-LIB: “Yeah.”, “Thanks for the food.”,
“See you later.” After they exit:

                    LISA
          Look, honey, I know you’re mad.
          But we’re all just trying to help.

                    TEDDY
          Trying to help, trying to help.
          Okay, we’ve danced around this too
          long. For once, Mom. Listen to
          me. I don’t need or want help.
          From you. Or anyone else.

                    LISA
          What groups like this give me--

                    TEDDY
          Stop! I don’t want to be like you.
          Spending my whole life trying to
          fix myself, trying to achieve some
          impossible ideal that’s not me and
          putting my life on hold until I do.
          I don’t need to fix myself. I’m
          not broken.

She turns to exit.
                                                     23.


                       LISA
             Wait... I know I’m a blabbermouth
             and I’m sorry I’m such a bad role
             model and I passed my messed up
             stuff on to you... You say you
             don’t need any help, but when you
             keep everything inside, tamping it
             down, it comes out in other ways...
             like dating men who aren’t
             available. Men who put you down,
             make you feel bad about yourself.
             Ask yourself, why do you put up
             with that? I’m not saying you’re
             broken, but that’s what you’ve got
             to fix. And if you really don’t
             want to be like me, don’t marry a
             man who is less than you deserve.

This sinks in but Teddy resists.

                       TEDDY
             You’re wrong about James. He’s not
             Daddy. And next time you see me?
             I’m going to be engaged. I hope
             you can be happy for me.

Teddy exits.


INT. TEDDY & LISA'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY

Teddy, looking fabulous, finishes lighting romantic candles.
We hear a KNOCK on the door. She takes a big breath, then:

                          TEDDY
             It’s open.

James enters with flowers and a bottle of wine.

                       JAMES
             Happy anniversary, baby.

                        TEDDY
                 (to camera, excited)
             Every time he enters a room I feel
             like I’m on The Bachelor.
                 (then)
             Happy anniversary.

They kiss.    James hugs her tight.
                                       24.


           JAMES
One more sec. Did three breast
augmentations today and it’s nice
to feel the real thing.
    (then)
Wow, you look fantastic. Only...
    (touches her back)
Posture. We’ve talked about this -
your career would be further along
if your posture exuded confidence.

          TEDDY
You’re right, sorry.   Trying.

          JAMES
Trying allows for failure, just
commit.

          TEDDY
Well, speaking of committing... I
was going to wait til later but I’m
seriously about to burst.
    (taking his hands)
I know the divorce isn’t final yet--
    (to camera)
Shitty start for a proposal, it’ll
get better.

          JAMES
Actually, baby, the divorce. Gonna
take a bit longer than we hoped.

          TEDDY
What? Why? James, I don’t want be
in the shadows anymore. I hate
that you’re married.

          JAMES
I hate it, too. I love you, I want
to be with you. It’s just timing.
She’s under a lot of stress.

          TEDDY
Oh, who isn’t under a lot of
stress?!

          JAMES
Okay, dial it down. You’re doing
that thing where you let your
insecurities run the show and your
voice gets shrill.
                                                     25.


                    TEDDY
              (to camera)
          Why do I put up with that?
              (then, to James)
          Why do I put up with that?

                    JAMES
          What are you talking about? I
          don’t have the bandwidth for a
          Teddy tantrum right now.
                    TEDDY
              (to camera)
          Oh my god, is my mother actually
          right? Fuck.
              (to James)
          I’m talking about the way you treat
          me, the constant digs, corrections.
          It’s not right. I deserve better.
              (to camera, unsure)
          Don’t I?
Before they can get into it, we hear a DOORBELL. Teddy
crosses and opens the door to find Wednesday, Linus, Nicole
and Danny. Linus’ face is covered in red marks.
                    TEDDY (CONT'D)
          What are you doing here? Do you
          travel in a pack?
                    LINUS
          More of a tribe, but sure.
              (re: face)
          Microneedling. In a week I’ll have
          skin like the Hollywood filter.
          Not that I know what that is.

                     TEDDY
              (looking)
          No Cooper?

                    DANNY
          He didn’t think this was any of our
          business.

                      TEDDY
          It isn’t!

                    LINUS
          Yeah, but if we don’t obsess about
          other people’s problems we’ll have
          to think about our own, so...
                                      26.


          NICOLE
The thing is, after we left earlier
we felt bad that you were upset
with your mom because we agreed
with her that you could do better,
but then we realized people always
tell people they could do better
because that’s what they want to
hear, but is that really honest?

          WEDNESDAY
Yes, your guy’s married, but he’s
handsome and successful and judging
from the sounds your mother hears
through the walls, good in bed...

          TEDDY
Wait. So y’all are here to tell me
I can’t do better?

          DANNY
No, you so can! But we’re also
saying... can you?

          NICOLE
None of us is nineteen anymore.

          TEDDY
I’m twenty-eight.

          LINUS
Not nineteen.

          WEDNESDAY
Cute story. When I met my husband--
    (spots something)
James?

          TEDDY
You know him?

          WEDNESDAY
He’s my husband.

                           ACT THREE


INT. TEDDY & LISA’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

As before.    As they cross into the living room:

                       TEDDY
             What do you mean he’s your husband?

                       WEDNESDAY
             What else could I mean? James,
             what are you doing here?

                       TEDDY
                 (to camera)
             I knew his wife would be skinny.
             Yes, I go there right now.

                       JAMES
             Wednesday, I can--

                       TEDDY
             Wait, you said your wife’s name was
             Dorothy.

                        WEDNESDAY
             Dorothy?   That’s an old lady’s
             name.

                       JAMES
             It’s not your name.

                       NICOLE
                 (to Teddy)
             How did you not know she was his
             wife? Didn’t you cyberstalk?

                       TEDDY
             He’s not on any social media.

                        WEDNESDAY
             It’s something I always admired
             about him.

                       TEDDY
                 (momentary bond)
             Me, too.

                       DANNY
                 (sotto)
             This is getting a little weird.
                                                        28.


                    LINUS
              (sotto)
          I’m in heaven.

                    JAMES
          Who are these people?

                    WEDNESDAY
          They’re part of this food group I
          go to.
              (re: Teddy)
          She’s in it too.

                    TEDDY
          I went once.

                    WEDNESDAY
          How long has this been going on?

            JAMES                              TEDDY
Not long at all.                  Two years.   Today.

                    LINUS
          Woof.
              (to Wednesday)
          You poor thing--
              (adding Teddy)
          -ngs.

                    WEDNESDAY
          But we were trying to have a baby.

                   TEDDY
          What? You’re in the middle of a
          divorce!

                    WEDNESDAY
          What divorce?

                    TEDDY
          There’s no divorce?!

                    LISA (O.C.)
          What is going--

She enters, takes in the scene, and GASPS.

                    LISA (CONT'D)
          What’d I miss?

                    TEDDY
          I just found out James is
          Wednesday’s husband.
                                                      29.


                       LISA
          I knew it!

                    TEDDY
          No, you didn’t.

SFX: Timer.   Lisa reaches into her pocket and shuts it off.

                    LISA
          Shoot. Something in the oven.     Not
          a word til I get back.

                    TEDDY
          Mom, we’re not going to do that.

                    LISA
          Then come to the kitchen with me.

                    DANNY
          It sure smells good.


INT. APARTMENT - STAIRS/INT. RESTAURANT - KITCHEN

As they head down the stairs:

                    TEDDY
          Look, Wednesday, you have every
          reason to hate me. But I didn’t
          know he was your husband.

                    WEDNESDAY
          You knew he was somebody’s husband.

                    TEDDY
              (to camera)
          Fair point.

They arrive in the kitchen. Lisa crosses to the stove and
takes chocolate lava cakes out of the oven.

                    NICOLE
              (sotto to Linus and Danny)
          Don’t you just love a restaurant
          kitchen?

                    LINUS
          More than life itself.   Got to
          explore.

As Linus, Nicole and Danny explore:
                                       30.


          JAMES
    (to Wednesday)
Look, I know I fucked up. But it’s
over. I came here to end things.

             TEDDY
What?!

            WEDNESDAY
Really?    Is that true?

          LINUS
    (to Wednesday)
Oh, babe, look at him.
    (to James)
I’m sorry, are you a pie made by
angry housekeepers? Because you
are full of shit.

          TEDDY
You weren’t breaking up with me.
But I was just about to break up
with you.

          LISA
Oh honey, I’m so proud of you!   Was
it because of what I said?

             TEDDY
       (grudgingly)
Yes.

          WEDNESDAY
Oh my god, can we not make this not
about me right now?

          TEDDY
I’m sorry, just give us a minute.

            WEDNESDAY
Okay.    See? I’m nice.

          TEDDY
    (to Lisa)
I do date men who make me feel bad
about myself. And I need to look
at that. You were right.

          LISA
    (to Teddy)
You were right about me, too. I’ve
wasted so much of my life being
unhappy with myself.
          (MORE)

          LISA (CONT'D)
There was no “body acceptance” when
I was growing up. That’s like a
foreign language to me.

          TEDDY
Well, I may want it, but I’m not
there yet, either. And at least
you’re honest about your struggles.
I hide what I’m going through with
eating... and everything else.

             LISA
Oh, honey.     I’ll do better.

           TEDDY
Me, too. And thank you. I do
think I could use some help.
Thought I didn’t. Thought I was
different.

          NICOLE
Thinking you’re different is
what’ll kill you.

          LINUS
And, babe, there’s no one in a food
issues group who doesn’t know about
hiding things. We hide what we
eat, we hide when we eat, we hide
from mirrors and scales. It’s all
shame and guilt and things we’re
afraid to say out loud like...
    (re: face)
This isn’t microneedling! I’ve
been stalking my ex for weeks and
today I saw him with another man
and I jumped into a bush.

          NICOLE
I hide stuff, too. Like most of
the time I love myself, but there’s
times I take my clothes off and
just effing hate myself.

          DANNY
I’m scared I’m gonna die.

          WEDNESDAY
I weigh a hundred and twelve!

          NICOLE
That’s your big dark secret?
                                                      32.


                    WEDNESDAY
          I tell everyone I weigh a hundred
          and eight. That’s a big
          confession. Why can’t anyone be
          supportive of me?

                    NICOLE
          Girl, you don’t make it easy.

                    WEDNESDAY
          I spend every second of every day
          trying to be perfect. And my
          husband still cheats on me.
              (to James)
          Why was I trying so hard to be
          perfect for you?

                    TEDDY
          Why did I think you were making me
          better?

                    WEDNESDAY
          Oh, it’s not even about him. It’s
          about needing to believe like he
          was the thing, the handsome prince,
          the one everyone wants. Like... if
          I can get him to love me maybe I’m
          not as unlovable as I think I am.
              (tearing up)
          It’s all just... feeling like
          you’re not enough, you know?

This strikes a chord in the group.   Everyone gets emotional.

                    TEDDY
              (tearing up)
          Yeah, I do know.

                     NICOLE
          Me, too.

                    LINUS
          All the time.

                    LISA
          My whole life.

                    DANNY
          Food makes it better.

                    TEDDY
          For a minute. But then... it’s all
          connected y’know? I think I... No,
          I don’t want to get into...
                                                     33.


The other’s AD-LIB: “Let it out.”, “It’s OK.”, “We’re here.”

                      TEDDY (CONT'D)
            I think I... date men who make me
            feel bad about myself because...
            it’s what I know. It validates
            what I’m already feeling. And then
            when it ends, there’s food. Food
            will always be there, food will
            never leave me.

Lisa hugs Teddy as everyone wipes away tears.

                      TEDDY (CONT'D)
            Is there actually anyone who likes
            themselves?

                      JAMES
                (sincerely)
            I do.

The others AD-LIB: “Shut up.”, “Unbelievable.”, “Jerk.”

                       LINUS
            Jealous.

                      JAMES
            Look, nothing I say right now is
            gonna be right. There’s no me
            coming off well here, I know that.
            But I honestly did and do love both
            of you.

                      WEDNESDAY
            It’s over, James.

He nods and then gives the slightest of glances toward Teddy.

                      TEDDY
            Obviously with me, too.

                      NICOLE
            Every marriage ending is a tragedy.
                (whips out)
            Which one of you wants my card?

Wednesday snaps it up.

                      JAMES
                (to Teddy and Wednesday)
            I’m sorry. I’m truly, truly sorry.

He exits.   They all watch him go.
                                                       34.


                    LINUS
          Okay, I’ll say it. Nice ass. But
          not nice enough to justify what he
          put you two through.

                    WEDNESDAY
          I’m not going to be married. All
          my life all I wanted to be is
          married. And now I won’t be.

Without thinking, she picks up one of the lava cakes and
takes a bite. Her eyes roll back into her head.

                    WEDNESDAY (CONT'D)
          Oh. My. God. I haven’t had sugar
          in five years. So good. So good.

The others watch wide-eyed as she downs it like an animal.

                    LINUS
          Played out, but I’ll have what
          she’s having.

                    TEDDY
          I think I need some air.

As Teddy exits, Lisa stops her.

                    LISA
          We’re good, right?

                    TEDDY
          Yeah.

                    LISA
          One thing I know is that you won’t
          pass this stuff on to your kid.

                    TEDDY
          No, I won’t. Thanks.

Teddy heads out.

                    LISA
              (calling after)
          It’s not easy!

Teddy glances at the camera as she exits.


EXT. APARTMENT - ALLEYWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Teddy steps outside. Cooper, planting flowers in the
alleyway, turns. They look at each other.
                                      35.


          COOPER
Is it too late to pretend you
didn’t see me?

          TEDDY
A hundred percent.
          COOPER
I know this looks weird. I usually
do it at night. Just made it
weirder. Any chance you’ve heard
of Guerrilla Gardening?
    (off her puzzled look)
Basically it’s illegally planting
stuff on public property. It’s my
way of sticking it to the man.
          TEDDY
But aren’t you the man?
            COOPER
Yeah, I guess I just like flowers.
     (then)
When I left earlier I noticed this
area could use something lively.
     (shyly)
Sort of like when you showed up at
the group. Any chance you might
come back? Some of it’s BS, but
you might get something out of it.
Or realize you’re great the way you
are.

           TEDDY
    (beat)
Was that “The Grab”?

          COOPER
Maybe.

          TEDDY
Y’all are an interesting bunch.

          COOPER
Is there a story behind the
“y’all”?

          TEDDY
Yes, but it’s a long one. And I
don’t think Wednesday will want me
in the group. Turns out I’ve been
sleeping with her husband.
                                               36.


                    COOPER
          Wow. Well, maybe the two of you
          can help each other through that.

                    TEDDY
          You’re so nice.

                      COOPER
          Too nice?

                      TEDDY
          Maybe.

They share a look.    It is indeed a moment.

                    TEDDY (CONT'D)
              (to camera)
          Am I actually attracted to a nice
          guy? Maybe I don’t need help.

SFX: Text on Cooper’s phone.

                     COOPER
              (looks)
          My fiance.

                    TEDDY
              (to camera)
          There it is.

                      JARED (O.C.)
          Dudes!

Jared strolls up holding a bottle.

                    JARED (CONT'D)
          Your mom said I should stop by
          sometime.
              (holds up bottle)
          Vodka. No carbs.

                    COOPER
          You go ahead.
              (starts to text, then, to
               Teddy)
          Anyway... see you next week?

                    TEDDY
          Yeah, I’ll be there.
