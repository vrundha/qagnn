     A COOING NEWBORN, nestled at her mother’s breast, feeding.
     VICKY McGEE rocks the child in a chair by an open window.
     26 and bright-eyed, Vicky gazes down at the bundle of joy
     cradled in her arms. She wipes milk from baby’s cheek with
     a cloth. Then she looks up and smiles at...

     ANDY McGEE, standing in the doorway, looking lovingly upon
     his wife and child. He’s 27, with an All-American smile.
     Soft morning light filters in, glows Vicky’s hair like a halo.




                                           R
     A gentle breeze flutters the long, sheer curtains.
     An idyllic scene, a heightened reality, dreamlike...




                                 FO
     Vicky lays the child gently in the nearby crib, then pulls
     the string on the colorful MOBILE that hangs above it. The
     mobile spins slowly, playing a familiar lullaby.
     Then Vicky takes Andy’s hand, leads him down the hallway
     toward the bedroom.
                          K
     IN THE CRIB, the child lies there a moment, staring up at
     mobile as it spins, spins, spins...
                EC

     Then a whimper, soft. Then another.
     Perhaps she wasn’t finished feeding. Or just misses the warmth
     of mother’s embrace. Either way, baby starts to cry.
     Quietly at first. Then louder, louder... Then VIBRATIONS.
   H


     DOWN THE HALL, Vicky turns into the bedroom. But Andy stops,
     turns back. A strange feeling hitting him...
 LC




     IN THE CRIB, the air DISTORTS SLIGHTLY around the child’s head
     as she cries. Like WAVES OF HEAT rising off hot pavement.
     Tears come harder now. Pain? Fear? Vibrations grow stronger.
     Sweat beads on baby’s forehead. Flowers wilt across the room.

     Then the spinning mobile CATCHES FIRE...
     TENDRILS OF SMOKE waft out from the doorway...

     Andy RUSHES back to the room... He turns into the doorway...
     The flaming mobile... Crib full of smoke...
     ON ANDY’S FACE as he arrives at the crib, leans over the
     railing... and gasps in horror at what he sees inside.
     His baby’s head engulfed in flames. SUDDENLY--

     ANDY WAKES WITH A START. He sits up in bed, sweating, trying
     to catch his breath. Rattled by the nightmare.

     don’t see her face. Turned away, fast asleep.
     Andy climbs warily out of bed and shuffles to the bathroom.
     Outside the windows, the deep blue of predawn.

     Small and not so small. On his arms, legs, neck. Burn marks.

     He splashes water on his face. We might wonder if he’s coming
     off a three-day bender. Lines branch out from the corners of
     his tired, bloodshot eyes. His short hair flecked with grey.

     INT. MCGEE HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
     Andy shuffles down the darkened hallway, peers into a BEDROOM.
