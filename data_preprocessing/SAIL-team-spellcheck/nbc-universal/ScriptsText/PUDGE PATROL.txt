INT. NONDESCRIPT DARK SPACE - NIGHT

Two TEENAGE GIRLS (LIBBY and ASTRID) are covered head to toe
in a red, gooey, glowing disgusting gelatinous material. So
covered that they’d be pretty unrecognizable in a lineup.

One of them reaches purposefully into the open chest cavity
of a GIANT MONSTER BEING. She is neck deep in monster guts,
rooting around. WET, SLOPPY SQUISHING SOUNDS ensue.

She picks up a banana-shaped organ and holds it up for her
friend, trying not to inhale or look too closely.

                    LIBBY
          Gross! Is this it? It has those
          fuzzy swirly thingies.

Astrid looks at the organ and compares it against a chart.

                    ASTRID
          Fascinating extracellular matrix.
          But I don’t think so. It’s
          supposed to be more dick-shaped.

Beat.

                     ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Ohhhh, you know what? I think
          ”Tonton” basically means tongue.
              (beat)
          So. Yeah, just rip out his tongue.

                    LIBBY
          Just?

                    ASTRID
          Here, I’ll do it.

Astrid shoves her hands into the monster’s gullet as Libby
peels her hands out of the gooey abdomen.
                    ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Got it!

They drop the tongue into a GLOWING COLLECTION DEVICE.

                    ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Look on the bright side, only 13
          more of these and we can close the
          portal...

                    LIBBY
          Great. Just in time for Formal.
                                                         2.


The monster’s GIGANTIC eyes flip open, and the girls SCREAM!

TITLE CARD: “Three Days Ago...”


EXT. COPPERS COVE - GOLDEN HOUR

The sun is setting on Coppers Cove, Ohio, a peculiar,
complicated place full of secrets. It has all the ingredients
of an idyllic and safe small town, but there’s something
sinister brewing underneath.


EXT. SUBURBAN SKY - NIGHT

A very full, very pink moon...

THEN - SCRIBBLED ACROSS THE SCREEN: S U ND AY


INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

A clean quiet car... No sounds of squishing. Only the sexy
dulcet tones of Wicked Game by Chris Isaac drift into the air
from the dashboard iPhone, as...

LIBBY, 16, romantic, emotional and fat with a “pretty face,”
drives the car while wearing homemade night vision goggles.

                    LIBBY
          This song makes me want to write
          poetry in a field of daffodils.

ASTRID, 16, feisty and fat with a “pretty intense sex drive,”
rides shotgun, also wearing homemade night vision goggles.

                    ASTRID
          This song makes me want to dry hump
          in the back of a pickup truck at
          Burger King.

They look at each other, goggle-eyed, and crack up laughing.

SMASH CUT TITLE: PUDGE PATROL


INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

Ace of Base plays on the radio. It might be 2020, but these
girls have tastes that skew way 90s.

They pass PROMISE ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL, which Astrid FLIPS OFF.
                                                            3.


Astrid grabs a thick spiral notebook labeled “Operation:
What Cool Kids Do At N ight. ”
                    ASTRID
              (scanning through)
          So, to conclude the research from
          last night, dance clubs are over
          but video arcades are happening.

They pass OUR LADY OF THE LAKE CHURCH, and both SHUDDER.

                       LIBBY
          Confirmed.

Libby turns on a cookie-cutter street lined with upper middle
class suburban homes and parks. Patrol time.

                    ASTRID
          Great. New Pudge Patrol mission,
          commencing now.

They strap on their binocular masks.

Libby stares into a house on the left side of the street.

Astrid peers intensely into a goth bedroom on the right side
of the street.

                       ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Jackpot.

                    LIBBY
          You got him?

                     ASTRID
          Okay well I can’t see him, but I’m
          pretty sure I see an upside down
          cross. SO hot.
              (beat)
          Affirmative. It’s definitely his
          room. I spy a Billie Eilish
          poster. Assuming that’s a band?
          Maybe we should give him a listen?

                    LIBBY
          Adding to the list.

                    ASTRID
          Ohmygod ohmygod, the subject is in
          frame! Hello, Sparrow.

SPARROW, 17, a studly brooding goth teen steps into frame.
                                                          4.


                     ASTRID (CONT'D)
          God he looks good.
              (beat)
          Yeah that’s right, baby, you
          stretch that sexy bod.
              (beat)
          Yeah. You rub on that stomach.
          Just a real slow, gentle rub.
              (beat)
          You gonna take those itchy pants
          off for mama?

                    LIBBY
          Jesus Christ.

                    ASTRID
          Oh please, like you wouldn’t hit it.

                     LIBBY
          You know I’m saving myself for my
          soulmate.
              (beat)
          Can we focus on the cultural task
          at hand please? See any, like,
          movie posters? Books?

                     ASTRID
          It’s really hard to see but I think
          I see an iguana cage?
              (beat)
          How about bitchface Candace?
          Anything good? Because I can’t
          imagine anything better than this
          sexy brooding bastard.

Through Libby’s binoculars we see Candace’s yard.

                    LIBBY
          Not sure. Something weird is afoot
          at the Queen C-Bomb’s. Her back
          gate is open and it never is.
Libby scans over to CANDACE in her bedroom, head mean girl,
beautiful, sexy and effortlessly cool.

                     LIBBY (CONT'D)
          God I bet she can eat whateh- what
          was that?!

Astrid quickly turns her binoculars to Candace’s house.

                    ASTRID
          What am I looking at?
                                                            5.


                    LIBBY
          It looked like someone was sneaking
          around in the backyard.

A DARK FIGURE emerges from Candace’s back gate and creeps
down the street toward a nondescript grey SUV and disappears
into the night.

The girls tear their binocular masks off and look at each
other, eyes wide.

                    ASTRID
          That ain’t Tate’s car.

Astrid jumps out to get a closer look, spots something on the
ground, picks it up. Runs back to car.

Astrid holds up a POLAROID. It’s an artsy, topless photo of
Candace, hands over her boobs.

                     LIBBY
          Whoa.

                    ASTRID
          Uh, this is hella weird.

                     LIBBY
          Correct.

                    ASTRID
          You drive, I’ll record.

They look at each other excitedly as they drive off. This
MUST be documented. This is their favorite part.

Both girls start thinking out loud, not speaking TO each
other, just more AT each other. Very stream of consciousness,
but this is how they do it. Astrid scribbles every word.

                     ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Desert Blue, possibly slate grey
          4Runner.
              (beat)
          More of a light concrete. The
          color of a box of Bareskin Trojans.
              (beat)
          Crumpled Polaroid found at the
          scene. Possibly a clue?

                     LIBBY
          Slouching adult male, 6’2, hunched
          shoulders. Seemed sad. Thoughtful.
              (beat)
                     (MORE)
                                                         6.

                    LIBBY (CONT'D)
          Why was he sneaking out of Candace’s
          house? Who are you, Mr. Man?

                    ASTRID
          Candace. Cheating on sexy boyf, Tate?

Libby pulls into her driveway.

                     LIBBY
          Standby.

As they exit the car the CAMERA PANS TO:

The ABNORMALLY LARGE PINK MOON.


INT. LIBBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The girls creep into Libby’s room, careful not to wake her
parents.


INT. LIBBY'S BEDROOM, AKA PUDGE PATROL HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

This is not the room of a cool kid. The walls are covered in
dated bands and TV show posters, mostly Alias, Detective
Olivia Benson from SVU, Xena, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
There are bookshelves full of their old notebooks and trunks
full of Astrid’s spy and science lab equipment since she
can’t keep it at her house. There are also rows of health and
diet books. This is their sanctuary.

A sign sits center stage on the wall. It reads PUDGE PATROL.
They own this title, but no one else is allowed to use it.

Libby sits on the floor, Astrid falls into the beanbag chair.

Libby grabs the notebook, her turn to write.

                     LIBBY
          Proceed.

Back to their ‘talking AT each other.’

                    ASTRID
          Sparrow. Objectively the most
          attractive guy in 11th grade.
          Chiseled abdomen. 6-pack. Nay, 9-
          pack. Trying something new with his
          luscious locks, shinier than usual.
          Auburn chest hair scattered in
          between two heaving and defined -
                                                         7.


                    LIBBY
              (interrupting)
          Yeah I think we’re done here.

Astrid laughs and hits play on some Billie Eilish as Libby
assesses their notes. They nailed it.

                    LIBBY (CONT'D)
              (re: the music)
          Huh. Not sure I get it, but okay.
          You really think us blasting music
          like this in college is actually
          gonna make people want to hang out
          with us?

                    ASTRID
          I mean, it might? Kids today!
              (serious)
          I dunno, Libs. Thought the whole
          point was to figure out how to
          blend in and not be so “us.”

                    LIBBY
          But I love us.

                    ASTRID
          Just like I love Sparrow’s creamy-
          white translucent skin?
              (off Libby’s look)
          I love us too, Libs.

Astrid clicks around on her laptop.

                    ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Ummm, you have to feed iguanas live
          crickets... Which could be
          scientifically interesting so
          therefore cool?

Beat as they look at each other. No way.
Astrid puts on rubber gloves from her pocket and pulls the
crumpled Polaroid from her bag.

                    ASTRID (CONT'D)
          I’m gonna pull prints off this
          tomorrow, just in case.

                       LIBBY
          Good call.

Astrid places the Polaroid into their PATROL TROPHY BOX, a
box of ‘evidence’ labeled “Trophies” and completely hidden in
the back of Libby’s closet.
                                                           8.


Astrid rifles through the box, picks up something shiny-

                    ASTRID
          Awww, Sparrow’s first nipple ring.

A sudden interloper in their safe space: KAITLIN, Libby’s
little sister, 12-going-on-40, a lanky, know-it-all tween,
wearing a Bluetooth earpiece.

                    KAITLIN
          You know, Sparrow’s going to the
          party tonight.

                    LIBBY
          Kaitlin! Get out of my roo--

                    ASTRID
              (hormones in full effect)
          What party tonight?

                    KAITLIN
          The party at Tate’s.

                    LIBBY
          How do you know this, you’re 12?

                    KAITLIN
              (shrugs)
          I’m connected.

                    LIBBY
          But it’s a Sunday night!

                    KAITLIN
              (shrugs)
          It’s what the cool kids are doing.

                                                  CUT TO:


EXT. TATE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The sounds of a kickin’ suburban house party are in full effect.

Astrid scopes the house eagerly. Libby doesn’t look convinced.

                    ASTRID
          And here we are! And Sparrow’s in
          there, and I look fly as hell. And I
          KNOW there’s some hunnies in there
          dying to get a piece of your jelly.

                    LIBBY
          I don’t know.
                                                            9.


                       ASTRID
          I DO know.

This makes Libby laugh.


INT. TATE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Everything looks expensive, cold grey tones. No parents in
sight.

They slowly step inside, looking at each other like, “Omg
we’re doing this!”

VALERIE, 16, drama club, wiping tears from her eyes, hands
the girls cups.

                    VALERIE
              (to the girls, thru tears)
          Oh, hey guys! Out on a Sunday.
          Rock and roll, ladies.

                       ASTRID
          Thanks!

                    LIBBY
          Uhh, are you-

                    VALERIE
          For the millionth time I’m not
          crying! It’s allergies!!

Candace and her boyfriend, TATE, 16, dreamy soccer stud, are
weirdly feeling each other’s butts, UNDER their jeans. Tate
stumbles drunkenly. Astrid STARES at them as they walk past.

                    ASTRID
          They’re totally having sex, right?
          I hate that he’s so hot. I bet his
          butt feels like a hard dinner roll
          or like the curve of a ripe plum or
          maybe two peeled honeydew melons.

Candace is aware Astrid is staring.

                    CANDACE
          What’re you staring at, FatAsstrid?

Libby WINCES for her friend.

                    TATE
              (old-fashioned bow)
          Make way! Pudge Patrol, coming
          through.
                                                        10.


A few kids laugh. Libby and Astrid are immediately deflated.

                    ASTRID
          Blow it off. Let’s just keep going.

The girls head into the -

LIVING ROOM

The girls awkwardly stand in a sea of cliques. Astrid
nervously chugs her beer. Libby stares blankly at hers.
Sparrow sips a beer in the corner. Astrid and Sparrow lock
eyes for a (lusty, was it?) split-second.

                    ASTRID (CONT'D)
          I swear to God he just looked at me.
Libby gives her friend an encouraging mini high-five.

Candace and Tate are quietly arguing. We can’t hear it yet.

KITCHEN

Candace is visibly upset, Tate is visibly drunk.

                    CANDACE
          It’s not my fault my mom won’t let
          me go to Formal.

                    TATE
          Since when do you do what she says?

                    CANDACE
          I don’t. I’m just trying to keep
          the peace so I can get her to let
          me go to LA this summer.

                    TATE
          And if you stayed, you’d be stuck
          with me. I get it.
                    CANDACE
          That’s not what I said!

                    TATE
          Whatever. You should just leave
          town. I mean why even stay. You
          wanna start a new life, go.

                    CANDACE
          You’re being such an asshole.

Tate storms off.
                                                   11.


Libby is accidentally staring at Candace.

                    CANDACE (CONT'D)
          Why do you guys keep staring at me?

                    LIBBY
          Nothing, I just, I-- Are you okay?

                    CANDACE
          Gross.

Libby watches Candace leave, then-

                    LIBBY
          Can we just go home?
                    ASTRID
          Sure, they are officially killing
          my Sparrow-boner.

The Girls head out to-

FRONT PORCH

Tate is drunk, siting on the steps.

                     TATE
              (slurring a little)
          What’re you looking at. Stupid spying
          creepers. Why do you even do that?
              (beat)
          And why are you even here? I
          didn’t invite you.

                    ASTRID
          Don’t worry about it, we’re outa here.

The girls turn to leave but he keeps at it.

                    TATE
          I mean, look at you. You should do
          us all a favor and just stay in
          your little weird patrol car and
          never come out.

                    ASTRID
          You’re a monster.

                    TATE
              (laughing)
          Oh yeah? Check out a mirror.
                                                        12.


INT. LIBBY’S CAR - A LITTLE LATER

Libby is wiping away tears. Astrid looks FURIOUS.

                    ASTRID
          I hate that asshole.   I wish he’d
          just evaporate.

                    LIBBY
          Goddammit, I’m so sick of being
          treated like we’re sub-human.

Astrid grabs her hand and gives it a squeeze.

                     ASTRID
          Me too.
              (beat)
          But you know we’re not, right?
          We’re awesome. Maybe they’re the
          sub-humans and we’re the normal
          ones.

                    LIBBY
          But what he said...about the mirror.
          Are we really that gross? Is that
          really how everyone sees us?

                    ASTRID
          No. Why? Just because we have a few
          extra luscious curves? And weird fun
          extracurriculars? No no no no no. I
          refuse to let some idiot chodebag
          tell us who we are. He doesn’t even
          know us. And what, he gets to be a
          total dick to us because his butt is
          hard and he kicks a ball around a
          field? What is that even?

Beat.

                    LIBBY
          You know what might make us feel
          better?


EXT. LIBBY’S BACKYARD - LATER

The girls sit in Libby’s backyard. Eerie sounds of owls and
bats echo. A GIANT PINK MOON and a WEIRD GLOW fill the sky.

In between them: the Trophy Box. Libby grabs an item labeled
“TATE’S HACKY SACK” from the box.
                                                          13.


                      LIBBY
            Let’s burn the bitch.

                      ASTRID
            Whoa! I’m liking this fury.

Libby grabs a copper ashtray, sets the Hacky sack inside. She
sprinkles some dirt on for good measure. Astrid appreciates
the pomp and circumstance, and so plucks a nearby flower, and
scatters the petals over the Hacky sack and dirt.

Libby places a piece of bark on top of the pile and looks at
Astrid. They nod, satisfied. Libby strikes a match, tosses it
onto the “sacrifice.”

It LIGHTS UP in a FIREY BLAZE.

They start relishing in the ritualism of it all.    They look
at each other with wild excited eyes.

Libby stands up and starts spinning.

                      LIBBY
            We want you all to just disappear!

Astrid jumps up and starts spinning too.

                       ASTRID
            Oooh yeah.
                (beat)
            We want Tate to just evaporate!

Now they’re really feelin’ it- they act out all their
“instructions.”

                      LIBBY
            Now raise your hands up and make
            sea kelp arms! Here, grab my hands!

She does.

                      LIBBY (CONT'D)
            Now lean back!

                      ASTRID
            Now stare up at the moon and howl!

They HOWL the fuck out of it.    Releasing all their hard-won
fury into the night sky.

                      LIBBY
            And now say “We want you all to
            evaporate.”
                                                           14.


                     ASTRID
          And on the count of three say it
          backwards!

                      LIBBY
          1, 2, 3 -

They laugh at the ridiculousness of it all as they awkwardly
stumble through saying it backwards.

                    LIBBY AND ASTRID
          Etaropave...ot...lla...ouy...tnaw
          ...ew?

A LOUD BOOM as a LIGHTNING BOLT lights up the night sky,
breaking their ritual vibe. A crazy-looking MASS OF SPIKEY
CLOUDS comes into view and a WEIRD MAGENTA GLOW takes over.
It doesn’t look natural. At all.

Astrid and Libby look at each other.

                      LIBBY
          Weird.

                    ASTRID
          Yeah, cool coincidence.

Astrid notices the time. It’s 10:15pm.

                      ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Shit!    Curfew!


INT. LIBBY’S CAR - LATER

Libby stops the car at Astrid’s house, Astrid jumps out.

                    ASTRID
          Thanks, pal. I feel so much better!

                    LIBBY
          Me too! That was so fun.

As Libby drives away we CLOSE UP ON a GLOWING BLOB OF RED GOO
being sucked down a drainage gate as a MONSTER HAND WITH LONG
CLAWLIKE FINGERNAILS closes the grate behind it, disappearing
out of sight.


EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

A CRYING WOMAN, 30s, sits on a bus stop bench by herself,
quietly sniffling.
                                                            15.


Just as she starts to pull a tissue from her purse, she is
WHISKED from the bench into thin air, her orphaned tissue
floating in the wind.


INT. ASTRID’S HOUSE - SAME

Astrid creeps up the stairs, passing the dozens of crosses
and Jesus statues that line the hallway.

TV is blaring from her parents’ bedroom.

                    NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
          Coppers Cove residents are
          hunkering down as a surprise storm
          is set to hit our sleepy town...

Astrid tiptoes to her bedroom, creaks open the door and -

                    ASTRID’S MOM JANET
          Nothing good happens after ten,
          Astrid.

Astrid’s Mom JANET stands in the dark hallway, arms crossed.

                     ASTRID
               (as her door closes)
          Good doesn’t even start til ten,
          Mom!

Janet makes the sign of the cross.


EXT. STREET BY BRIGHTON CREEK TRAIL - NIGHT

Tate wanders drunkenly down the dark road, tears in his eyes.

                    TATE
              (drunken mumble)
          ...stupid Candace...just gonna be
          alone...

He looks up at the weirdly colored sky. WTF. He sees a
SHADOWY FIGURE up ahead. The Shadowy Figure heads into
Brighton Creek Trail.

Tate stops, getting his bearings.    Which way is home?

Then, Tate hears a voice calling him from the trail.      A low,
hard to make out voice.

He follows the voice into the trail.

                       END OF ACT ONE
                                                          16.


                            ACT TWO

SCRIBBLED ACROSS THE SCREEN: M O ND AY


EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOTS OF COPPERS COVE - NEXT MORNING

The sky remains an odd shade of magenta. We see tree-lined
streets with similar houses, the church from last night, and
the high school: Promise Academy.


INT. LIBBY’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Libby stands at her sink, staring at herself in the mirror,
wipes a bead of sweat from her forehead. Turns to go and,
feeling a little woozy, braces herself against the wall.

The weird lightning flashes again, and she YELPS as she
SIMULTANEOUSLY gets a sharp Charley horse in her leg.

                    LIBBY
          Ouch! What the?


INT. ASTRID'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Astrid sits up in bed, clearly smelling something sour. News
blares from the other room, as usual.

                    NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
          Local Crime Stoppers reported a
          missing woman, last seen crying at
          the city central bus station...

Astrid closes her bedroom door, holds her nose, grimaces.

                    ASTRID
              (to herself)
          Yikes, Mom, what grossness are you
          cooking?


INT. PROMISE ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

Establishing shots of Promise Academy. A private charter
school that functions like a hippie Montessori. The lines
between teacher and student are blurry.

A group of GRUNGY KIDS sits in a circle, meditating near a
sign-up sheet to learn how to grow your own hemp.

A banner reads: “Proudly Cell Phone Free Since 2017”
                                                        17.


SOCCER JOCKS kick around a vegan leather ball.

A sign for something called GATEWAY TO GOD - YOUTH GROUP.
Sign says: ”Bracelet making tonight!” Several WELL-GROOMED
KIDS high five, “Amen, broseph.”

                    ASTRID
          If my mom pitches Gateway to God to
          me one more time...

                    LIBBY
          Ugh, sorry, dude.

TWO RANDOM STONERS wander past Libby and Astrid-

                    STONER 1
          You see that weird round crazy
          lightning last night? Looked fake.

                    STONER 2
          Dude, I thought I was just stoned.

Libby clocks this, a little concerned. Astrid disregards.


INT. PROMISE ACADEMY AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

RAJ VARSHIDI, 50s, Indian, wants badly to be liked, stands at
the podium, teachers behind him. He starts snapping his
fingers, kids join in. This is how this school quiets down.

                    VARSHIDI
          Good morning, Honey Badgers! A
          couple big announcements this A.M!
          First of all, the big event you’ve
          all been waiting for... Midterms!
              (waiting for laughs)
          JK, gang! The Soccer Formal!
          Without further ado... Michelle!

MICHELLE, 27, hot teacher who still shops at Forever 21,
GRABS the mic. She fluffs her hair, notices she’s wearing the
same dress as Candace, and subtly boosts her cleave.

                    MICHELLE
          Soccer Formal tix are offish’ on
          sale. There’s a sign-up sheet
          outside my classroom. I’ll be
          announcing the Formal theme later
          this week, so make sure you write
          in a suggestion. And make them good
          this year, for once.
                                                        18.


                    VARSHIDI
          Yes, m’aam! And finally, a word
          from our sponsors...Please welcome:
          Badgers alumni, Dance Sponsors, and
          owners of Sun Buns Tanning!

NIGEL, 40s, trying but failing to look expensive, and GRANT,
30s, walking money, take to the podium.

                    NIGEL
          Hey Badge--

                    GRANT
          Actually, I’m the owner and my
          brother’s only the manager.

                    NIGEL
          I run operations, but anyway- Hey
          Badgers. We’re offering a student
          discount until the Formal. Just
          flash your school ID. And the Honey
          Badger sign.

Libby leans over to Astrid.

                    LIBBY
          I know it’s cliché, but I really
          want to go to the dance.

                    ASTRID
          Me too, girl. Worst comes to worst,
          I’ll be your date.

                    LIBBY
          What?? You? With moi? I’d be honored!

Libby notices Varshidi’s been suddenly beckoned to the corner
by SIMONE SPILLER, 20s, Kristen Schaal type.

                    VARSHIDI
          Counselor Simone, please go ahead.

Varshidi nods as Simone steps up to the microphone...

                    SIMONE
          Guys, it’s probably nothing. But
          the police got a call from Tate
          Vanderberg’s father. Tate appears
          to be missing this morning.
              (quieting the murmurs)
          He probably just left early for
          soccer practice- but has anyone
          seen him today?
                                                         19.


Everyone turns to Candace, who shakes her head. Libby and
Astrid look at each other like “weird.”

EGGS, 17, a nerdy guy, on the spectrum, raises his hand and
stands to speak.

                    EGGS
          It’s statistically nearly
          impossible to find a missing person
          after 72 hours. If a person has
          been missing for 7 years in most
          states, they can be legally
          declared deceased--

                    VARSHIDI
          OK! Thanks, Eggs, he’s probably
          fine, but you know, if you see
          something--

INSANE THUNDER cracks from outside, and Libby YELPS loudly -
another simultaneous Charley horse. All eyes,
embarrassingly, on her.

                    LIBBY
          Sorry! Nothing! Sorry.

Bell RINGS.

Kids file out to class. Michelle joins the soccer jocks,
joking around like she’s one of them.

Candace shuffles toward the door, dialing her phone...

                    TATE’S VOICEMAIL
          You’ve reached the Tatemeister, you
          lucky s.o.b....You know what to
          do...Unless you’re a dumbass.

                    CANDACE
          Tate? Where the hell are you!?


INT. DARK NONDESCRIPT ROOM   - CONTINUOUS

The space is so dark you can barely tell it’s some sort of
cavernous tunnel. Tate sits bound to a chair behind a locked
holding cell. Tied up next to him: the Crying Woman from the
bus stop. In the background, the faint sounds of... German
techno music? And drink shakers?

Both seem to be under a spell and both have a steady stream
of tears running down their faces, directly into a GIANT
FANCY MARTINI GLASS under each chair.
                                                         20.


EXT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Kids flood the hallways heading to first period.

                    ASTRID
          What was that outburst? You okay?

                     LIBBY
          This is going to sound crazy, but
              (beat)
          Every time the lightning flashes, I
          get a spasm in my leg.

They overhear Valerie gossiping with a couple THEATER KIDS.

                    THEATER GAL
          Where do you think Tate is?

                    VALERIE
          He was pretty wasted. I bet he
          passed out behind Arby’s again.

Valerie SNEEZES and wipes allergy tears from her eyes.

                    VALERIE (CONT'D)
          Damn allergies.

                    THEATER GUY
          I mean, he’s kind of a dick, so who
          knows what he got himself into. I
          bet he has a sidepiece in the city.

                    THEATER GAL
          I heard he was legit crying when he
          disappeared from his own party.

Libby elbows Astrid, half-joking.

                    LIBBY
          You don’t think we did that, right?
                    ASTRID
          Ha, I wish we had the power to make
          assholes disappear!


INT. SCIENCE CLASS - DAY

Pretty high-tech for high school. Each desk has a full lab
set. Libby and Astrid take their seats.

FRANK FRICK, 30s, nerdy and loveable, notices a large jar set
up on a desk with the sign, “Mr. Frick Date Fund.”
                                                        21.


                     FRICK
          Very funny, guys. I don’t need a
          date fund.
              (patting the fancy piece
               of equipment on his desk)
          Already got a hot date with my new
          fave portable Bunsen Burner, Bunny!

GROANS from students. Frick laughs.

                    FRICK (CONT'D)
          If any of you touch her, I am not
          responsible for my actions, capiche?
          She was a gift from my friend
              (whispered)
          At NASA.
Astrid starts setting up their lab.

                    ASTRID
          Omg, what is that smell?
          Horseradish?

                    LIBBY
          I don’t smell anything.

                    ASTRID
          You don’t!? How?

Eggs eagerly shoots his hand up into the air.

                    EGGS
          Hey, Mr. Frick, Mr. Frick!

                       MR. FRICK
          Yes, Eggs.

                    EGGS
          Mr. Frick, how come the storm
          clouds today don’t look anything
          like standard Cumulonimbus clouds?
                    ASTRID
          It’s probably because the thermal
          rose so quickly.

Another FLASH and Libby YELPS again, manages to stifle it.

                    ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Seriously, what is going on with
          you?

                    LIBBY
          I don’t know!
                                                        22.


Libby looks toward the windows: The clouds are TOTALLY
UNNATURAL spikey balls, and the sky is a color definitely not
usually found in nature...


INT. PHOTOGRAPHY CLASSROOM - SAME

Students set up their photography projects on the display wall.

Libby stands at the window, adjusting a camera lens while
focusing outside. Something GIANT rustles in the trees. She
pauses, zooms in closer and...it’s gone. HMM, creepy.

The teacher, JONAS, late 30s, man bun, tinkers at his desk.
Candace approaches him.

                    CANDACE
          Thank you again for last night.

                    JONAS
          No sweat. Just keep it on the DL,
          please. They’re in the back.

Candace grabs a stack of racy photos of herself from the back
closet, shoves them in folders.

Libby watches the exchange, whispering into her tiny recorder.

                    LIBBY
          I think I know whose Blue 4-Runner
          was at Candace’s last night. And I
          am shocked to my core.

                    EGGS
          What are you doing?

                    LIBBY
              (startled)
          Jesus. Nothing, Eggs. Mind your
          beeswax.

Libby analyzes Candace’s shots of Tate on the display wall. Then
secretly pulls out her recorder.

Candace clocks Libby’s recorder. Libby clocks Candace clocking
her.

          Cool photo.

Candace totally ignores her, turns back to her desk. Libby
rolls her eyes. This bitch.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY OUTSIDE MICHELLE’S CLASSROOM - DAY

Astrid watches Sparrow stare at the sign on Michelle’s door,
“Soccer Formal Committee. Sign up here! No Nerds. JK LOL.”
He signs up. Astrid immediately takes the last spot.


INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

It’s pizza day. Libby and Astrid wait in line.

                    LIBBY
          I definitely saw rustling in the
          woods, though.

                    ASTRID
              (laughing)
          Did you fall asleep watching
          Twilight Zone again?

RUDE KID cuts in front of them.

                    RUDE KID
          Gotta get a jump on the pepperoni
          before Pudge Patrol cleans it out.

Several kids laugh. Libby’s face goes BEET red. Astrid rolls
her eyes at Rude Kid, grabs their slices to go.

                    ASTRID
          Come on, let’s get outta here.


INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - DAY

The girls are huddled into a stall munching on pizza. This is
their office and secret lunch room.

                    ASTRID
          It’s like, get some new material
          already.

                    LIBBY
          I just wish it didn’t sting every time.

                    ASTRID
          I know. Okay, so, what do you want
          to do tonight? Some light breaking
          and entering, perhaps?

The bathroom door OPENS and we hear the unmistakable CLICKS
of Michelle shoes. She’s with her shadow, Counselor Simone.

Libby and Astrid freeze as Michelle and Simone pee.
                                                        24.


                    MICHELLE
          I hope Tate’s okay. He’s obvi my
          ideal court king for Formal!

                    SIMONE
          So I have some goss. I could get
          into so much trouble for this and
          the hubs could get fired-

                    MICHELLE
              (manipulative AF)
          Oooh dish. Pinky swear I won’t say
          anything. You know you’re my bff-
          esty. 4L.

                    SIMONE
              (blushing and flattered)
          I know. Apparently a few officers
          got called to Brighton Creek Trail.
          They found Tate’s school ID... But
          no sign of him. It’s like he
          “evaporated” or something.

Michelle and Simone leave just as another MAGENTA LIGHTNING
CRACK illuminates the already bright sky and Libby YELPS.

                    LIBBY
          Holy shit, Astrid.   “Evaporated?”

                    ASTRID
          Libs, it’s a common word, a coincidence!
          Speaking of, you gotta stop with the
          psychosomatic guilt yelps.

                     LIBBY
          They’re not psychosomatic and they
          hurt like hell.
              (beat)
          You don’t feel weird at all?

                    ASTRID
          No. I mean, the smell of breakfast
          made me extra nauseated this
          morning, but what else is new?

                    LIBBY
          What about science class? Horseradish?

                    ASTRID
              (deflecting)
          We didn’t do anything. We burned a
          Hacky sack, we danced around in the
          yard and yelled some stuff into the
          universe. People do it all the time.
                                                        25.


                    LIBBY
              (raising an eyebrow)
          Can we just go check it out
          tonight? For science?


EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - AFTER SCHOOL

Kids fight through the storm to get into cars and busses.

Candace, holding a FOLDER, follows Several Kids into A BIG
WHITE VAN labeled: “GATEWAY TO GOD.” Candace’s Mom CHRISTINE,
early 40s Tracy Flick type, loads the van. She wears a
bracelet that reads, ‘What Would CHRISTine Do?’

                    CHRISTINE
          Now who here pissed off God today
          and made him cry?

She laughs at her own joke and adjusts her hair.

                       CANDACE
                 (rolling her eyes)
          Mom.

                    CHRISTINE
          What’s in the portfolio? Those
          better not be the modeling photos I
          told you not to take.

                      CANDACE
          No.    It’s homework.

Christine closes the van doors and spots a poster: “Soccer
Formal Tickets On Sale Now!” She makes sure no one is
looking, RIPS the poster off the wall. She adjusts her pearls
and SMILES, jumping into the driver’s seat.


EXT. PROMISE ACADEMY BACK PARKING LOT - LITTLE LATER

Valerie SNEEZES as she leans against the brick wall by the
school theater exit. She’s totally alone, smoking a cig and
wiping her consistently watery eyes.

She sneezes again. The lot is empty.

She hears a NOISE off to the side like NAILS ON A CHALKBOARD,
turns to look and is CONFRONTED BY A LARGE BEING WE CAN’T SEE.
Eyes wide, she’s TERRIFIED. And locked in a trance.

                    LOW SCARY RASPY VOICE (O.S.)
          Hello Valerie. Alone again. Like
          always.
                    (MORE)
                                                           26.

                    LOW SCARY RASPY VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          A shame that your dramatic and
          annoying personality pushes
          everyone away. A shame that you
          have no one. No one at all.

Tears start STREAMING down her cheeks. Two LARGE BEASTLY
HANDS with LONG CLAWS extend out toward her face.

                    LOW SCARY RASPY VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I could drink you right up. In
          fact, I think I will.

A LONG DISGUSTING TONGUE SLOBBERS over her cheeks, licking
her tears, leaving a trail of RED GLOWING GOO.

She falls to the ground, unconscious, and is DRAGGED AWAY.

INT. LIBBY'S HOUSE - DINNER

Libby and Astrid chow down with Libby’s parents and siblings,
PAM (MOM), late 40s, wearing RN scrubs, HEIDI (MA), late 40s,
and sister Kaitlin. Little brother JOEY, 5, makes a mess.

Libby, Astrid and Kaitlin scarf their food.

                    PAM (MOM)
          Where’s the fire, girls?

                    LIBBY
          Mega homework. Mega test. Mega
          patrol.

                    KAITLIN
          Mega dorks.
              (to Mom)
          I have a critical conference call
          at 8.

                    PAM (MOM)
          Well don’t give yourselves gas.

            LIBBY                             KAITLIN
Mom!                            Gross.
                    HEIDI (MA)
              (to Kaitlin)
          Lights out at 9. Including critical
          conference calls.
              (to Libby and Astrid)
          And you two, be careful!
                                                        27.

          Ma, it’s fine, nothing that crazy
          ever happens here.


INT. DARK NONDESCRIPT SPACE - NIGHT

Tate and Crying Woman watch as an unconscious body is dragged
into the lair. We see it’s Valerie.

TECHNO MUSIC and PARTY LIGHTS are in full swing. Tate and
Crying Woman both have tears streaming down their faces and
into their martini glasses.

                    TATE
          Why can’t I stop crying?

                    CRYING WOMAN
          I don’t know. I can’t either.
              (through nonstop tears)
          Why am I weirdly attracted to the
          hideous monster thing? I know he’s
          disgusting, but is he also kinda...
          sexy? No, not sexy. Dangerous.
          Dangerous like a sexy daddy. Who
          deals party drugs. Like Predator
          with extra long claws and a sexy
          Timothy Olyphant vibe, right?

                    TATE
              (through tears)
          Gross but yes exactly.

An IMPOSING FIGURE pops in, looming over them...

And then turning, we finally see it. The TEARJERKER!

It is otherworldly, a monster not of this Earth. It stands
tall over them, SCARY AS HELL. But also kinda sexy.

                     TEARJERKER
          You’ve never been more right, my
          babies. And I’ll tell you why you
          can’t stop crying...
              (beat)
          Because you’re excellent party guests!

They’re both like WTF?

He reaches a 12-inch claw fingernail under Tate’s chair and
stirs the tear-martini, then licks off a delicious taste.

                    TEARJERKER (CONT'D)
          Almost ready...
                                                         28.


EXT. BRIGHTON CREEK TRAIL - NIGHT

Libby and Astrid tiptoe from the car toward the trail
entrance. They poke around the caution tape.

                    ASTRID
          What exactly are we looking for?

                    LIBBY
          Not sure. But I think that flag
          marks where Tate’s ID was found...

They tiptoe closer to the YELLOW FLAG marker...

The girls realize they’re crouched in a puddle of RED GOO. It
looks thick like gelatinous phlegm. Libby has to cover her
mouth to stop from gagging. Her leg spasms.

                    LIBBY (CONT'D)
          Ouch, my leg again! What is this
          stuff?

                    ASTRID
              (sniffing)
          I honestly have no idea.

                    LIBBY
          It’s disgusting.   So squishy.

Astrid sniffs around some more.

                    ASTRID
          Smells almost like burnt pickles.

                    LIBBY
          I think my leg’s reacting to it.

Libby and Astrid dig around the caution tape with sticks.
Something shiny GLEAMS under a leaf pile. Libby leans down.

                    LIBBY (CONT'D)
          Um, Astrid, I got something!!

Astrid comes running over, leans to get a better look.

                    ASTRID
          Is that a broken fingernail?
              (beat, huh?)
          A 12-inch long broken fingernail?

Astrid holds up a slightly curved, 12-inch long hybrid
between a claw and a perfectly manicured nail.
                                                        29.


                     LIBBY
          Looks like it?
              (more hesitation)
          Bag it up?

Girls hear rustling and heavy breathing in the bushes. They
look at each other. They’re in the clearing, nowhere to hide.

                    LIBBY (CONT'D)
              (beat, weakly)
          Hello...?

More rustling from the bushes. And GROWLING. They look at
each other, TERRIFIED and then -

A DARK HOODED FIGURE steps out from behind the trees.
Girls SCREAM. And faint.


EXT. BRIGHTON CREEK TRAIL - LATER

Libby and Astrid wake up to CU on Dark Hooded Figure as he
SLOWLY REMOVES HIS HOOD and -

He’s HOT AF.

                    ASTRID
          Oh shit, I’m gonna die at the hands
          of a hottie with a body.

Dark Hooded Figure laughs.

                    DARK HOODED FIGURE
          Relax, I’m not gonna kill you. I’m
          actually here to save you from the
          thing that wants to kill you.
          So...you’re welcome.

                    LIBBY
          Wait, what?
                    ASTRID
          Who the hell are you and what do you
          mean THING THAT WANTS TO KILL US???

                    DARK HOODED FIGURE
          Okay so, I’m Brutus. So, long
          story short, a portal to another
          dimension was opened up. A really
          bad, end of the world kind of
          dimension. Monsters. Bad guys.
          You know, like in the movies.
                    (MORE)
                                                    30.

                    DARK HOODED FIGURE (CONT'D)
          Thing is, it didn’t just open up by
          itself.

Libby and Astrid look at each other.

                    BRUTUS
          Turns out, the portal opened
          because of...you.

                    ASTRID
          What?

                    LIBBY
              (to Astrid)
          I told you!!!

                     BRUTUS
          Remember that spell you did?
              (beat)
          You know, when you were standing
          7.2349567 feet away from each
          other, the copper, the fir tree
          bark, and then, the piece de
          resistance. You said, “Etaropave...
          ot... lla... ouy... tnaw ...ew.”
          and well, in Monster, that loosely
          translates to, “Open the portal.”

                    LIBBY
              (in shocked autopilot)
          It sounds much prettier when you
          pronounce it.

                    BRUTUS
          You really should have known better
          than to do all that on the 3rd
          Sunday of the 9th month during a
          pink moon, when Uranus was circling
          the wolf rays.

He looks at them like, duh.

                     BRUTUS (CONT'D)
          Anyway, because YOU opened it, YOU
          are the ONLY ones who can close it,
          or else humanity sorta disappears.
          No biggie.

Libby and Astrid exchange a look.

                    LIBBY
              (stunned)
          We were just messing around! It was all
          fake! We were just blowing off steam!
                                                         31.


                    BRUTUS
          B-T-dubs, who hurt you? The portal
          you opened is no joke and very hard
          to access. Must be a lot of pain
          swirling around you guys.

Libby and Astrid exchange another look.

                    ASTRID
          Why should we believe you?

                    BRUTUS
          Ugh, fine. Proof. I hate this part.
          Really messes up my faux hawk.

ALLOFASUDDEN, a GLOWING horn sprouts out of his forehead.

Girls’ mouths HANG OPEN.

                     BRUTUS (CONT'D)
          I know.   Not a good look.

                    ASTRID
          Nice special effects makeup, tell
          Tate or Candace or whoever to kiss
          my fat ass. We’ll never ever go to
          one of their parties again. They
          win. Come on, Libby, let’s go. This
          dude’s psycho.

The girls turn to leave.   Libby’s unsure, but starts walking
with her friend...

                    BRUTUS
              (stopping them briefly)
          Look, I can’t force you to stay.
          Special rule number 6795C. But, the
          thing that has your friend is
          called a TEARJERKER and it targets
          anyone crying. The sadder you are,
          the more it wants you.
              (tossing Libby a PAMPHLET)
          It will say to you the deep dark
          thing you fear the most. And you
          really should...

They’re already running back to Libby’s car.

                    BRUTUS (CONT'D)
          ...know that your friend only has
          about 26 hours left.

EXT. O’MALLEY’S PIZZERIA - NIGHT

Nigel from Sun Buns sits somberly at an outdoor table as he
shoves a pizza slice into his mouth, then wipes a tear.

          bad, is it?


INT. CHURCH REC ROOM - NIGHT

Christine supervises as a group of kids organize piles of her
“What Would CHRISTine Do” bracelets.

                    CHRISTINE
          Speaking of sin, let’s talk about
          the upcoming fertile ground for
          sin: the Soccer Formal.

Kids look around at each other, a few GROANS.

                    CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
          Don’t think I wasn’t young once.
          We all know what happens at these
          things and I’m here to ask you,
          what would you rather have inside
          you? The lord’s light or the
          devil’s penis?

A few kids laugh.

                    CANDACE
          Jesus, Mom.

                    CHRISTINE
          Exactly. Jesus. Now if you’ll excuse
          me, I’m gonna go refill the punch.


INT. CHURCH MUD ROOM - SAME
Christine snoops through Candace’s backpack, finds her photos.
Sexy influencer/Maxim Mag style shots. She holds her hand up-

          forsaken me? Send me an angel of
          mercy to vanquish the devil teacher
          Jonas who took these disgusting

INT. LIBBY’S BEDROOM - LATER

Both Astrid and Libby are blank-faced, laying on Libby’s bed,
staring up at the ceiling. Libby clutches the PAMPHLET.

          That couldn’t have been for real,
          right? Someone’s screwing with us,
          right? Who do you think it is?

                    LIBBY
          I honestly don’t know what to think.

                    ASTRID
          What does it say again?

                    LIBBY
          Rule 7.85b, closing the portal-
          Collect the following 13 body
          parts: a krivack from a Klorfus, an
          eyeball from a Memoragatu, the glog
          from a Slim-- and a bunch of other
          words I don’t understand.

Libby starts pacing, they’re each having their own convo.

                    ASTRID
          Candace? Tate, even? Did someone
          see us in the yard last night? Are
          we not the only ones with night
          vision binocular masks??

                    LIBBY
          What does this stuff even mean?

                     ASTRID
          Definitely not Sparrow, of course.
              (beat)
          There must be a logical explanation
          for this. There always is.

Beat as they resume talking TO each other.

                    LIBBY
          Also...a horn...came out of his head.

                    ASTRID
          Yeah, there is that. At first I
          thought maybe it was a Pilar cyst.
          But those don’t present like that.

Storm is ramping up outside.
                                                        34.


                    LIBBY
          What if, he was telling the truth?

                    ASTRID
          But what about science?

                    LIBBY
          But what about...everything else?

Beat.

                    ASTRID
          Then that would mean....there are
          actually monsters in Coppers Cove
          and it’s all our fault.

                    LIBBY
          And if that’s true, then something
          called a Tearjerker is eating
          people’s tears and he’s holding
          Tate hostage. And if it’s all our
          fault, and somehow Tate has been...
          um... taken...or hurt, then I
          guess...we need to stop people from
          crying....and...

                     ASTRID
              (beat)
          Sonofabitch. We gotta find that
          asshole. How else will we know?

LIGHTNING STRIKES and for a second, as Libby grabs her leg,
the whole sky is illuminated, then goes PITCH BLACK.

                       END OF ACT TWO
                                                        35.


                           ACT THREE

SCRIBBLED ACROSS THE SCREEN: TU ES DAY


EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING

It’s a beautiful morning, birds chirping, sky back to normal.


INT. ASTRID’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Astrid stares at her reflection.

                    ASTRID
          It’s just a normal school day. Like
          ANY other day...Absolutely nothing
          insane happened last night.

She opens the blinds, looks out the window at the blue sky.

                    ASTRID (CONT'D)
          See! Normal.

From her parents bedroom she can hear the news-

                    NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
          Local police are searching for a
          man, last seen yesterday evening,
          crying at O’Malley’s Pizza...

                    ASTRID
          Well, shit.

INT. LIBBY’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Libby stares at her reflection. And the Buffy poster over her
shoulder.

                    LIBBY
          I’m a monster hunter. What? I opened
          a portal. What? Of monsters. WHAT?


EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING

Kids unload from buses as SOMETHING WATCHES THEM from the
woods. Astrid and Libby overhear a couple Theater Kids:

                    THEATER GAL
          Has anyone seen Valerie?
                                                        36.


                    THEATER GUY
          No, she wasn’t on the bus.

                    LIBBY
          Oh no, her allergies. It got Val!


INT. SCIENCE CLASS - DAY

Astrid hesitates, then approaches Mr. Frick at his desk as he
polishes his “Bunny” Bunsen Burner.

                    ASTRID
          Weird question.

                    MR. FRICK
          Remember, there are-

                    ASTRID
          No weird questions, right... Is
          there any chance monsters exist and
          there’s one that eats tears?

                    MR. FRICK
          Ha! I needed a good laugh this
          morning. Where do you get this stuff?


INT. PHOTOGRAPHY CLASSROOM - MORNING

Libby studies her patrol journal at her desk, “subtly” examines
the Tate photo across the room, and then takes more notes.

                    CANDACE
          You know you’re not as subtle as
          you think you are.

                    LIBBY
              (startled, then)
          Oh, you’re talking to me now?

                    CANDACE
          I never didn’t talk to you.

                    LIBBY
          Uh, mmmkay.
              (beat, getting her nerve)
          Ever since you got cool and I got
          fat, we haven’t exactly been
          buddies.

                    CANDACE
          You’re the one who ditched me for
          Astrid in 5th grade, remember?
                                                    37.


Beat as they both awkwardly let those barbs land.

                    CANDACE (CONT'D)
          So...do you...have any leads?

                     LIBBY
          Um. Let’s say, tbd.
              (beat)
          Have you heard anything from him?

                    CANDACE
          You tell me, you’re the creeper
          stalking everyone all the time, right?

Libby turns back around.
                     LIBBY
          Right.   Cool, have a nice life.

                     CANDACE
          Sorry.
              (beat)
          No offense.
              (beat)
          You know, I only said the Pudge
          Patrol thing to Tate once as a
          joke. I didn’t think he would
          spread it.

                    LIBBY
          Am I supposed to say “thank you?”

                    CANDACE
          I guess not.

                    LIBBY
          So, your jerk boyfriend?   Have you
          heard from him or what?

                    CANDACE
          No, nothing.
                     LIBBY
          Crap.

                     CANDACE
              (beat)
          He’s not always an asshole, you know.
              (beat)
          Unlike me.

Beat. They share a small smirk.
                                                         38.


INT. NONDESCRIPT SCARY SPACE - CONTINUOUS

Tate, Valerie, Nigel, and Crying Woman are tied to chairs. A
GIANT MARTINI GLASS under each one. Disco lights swirl above.

Tearjerker dances as he finishes strapping Nigel into his
chair, pepperoni stuck to Nigel’s shirt.

                    TEARJERKER
          Damn I love these sweet beats.

                    NIGEL
          Where am I?

                    TEARJERKER
          At the party, baby.
              (baby voice)
          Aww, is Nigel sad because he’ll
          never be as rich and powerful as
          his little brother Granty-poo?

                    NIGEL
          Wha-wha-what are you-

Tearjerker GRABS Nigel by the face, gets thisclose.   We see
the horror in Nigel’s eyes.

                    TEARJERKER
          It’s no use. I know you. And I
          know you’ll always be in his
          shadow. Always wanting what you’ll
          never be good enough to have.

Tears start STREAMING down Nigel’s face.

                    TEARJERKER (CONT'D)
          Speaking of wanting things!

Tearjerker steps back, suddenly lighthearted AF.

                    TEARJERKER (CONT'D)
          I know you’re not quite ready yet,
          but daddy wants a Teartini...

He walks back and forth between the victims, evaluating...

                    TEARJERKER (CONT'D)
          Hmmm, which one....

He grabs the martini glass underneath the Crying Woman, stirs
it with his long fingernail, then takes a taste.

                    TEARJERKER (CONT'D)
          This’ll do.
                                                        39.


Just as the criers breath a sigh of relief, Tearjerker JABS
two fingernails into Crying Woman’s eyes, and plucks them
out. Plops them into the Teartini.

                     TEARJERKER (CONT'D)
          Perfect.

The rest of them SCREAM.


INT. MICHELLE’S CLASSROOM - DAY

Students make giant tissue paper balls. Astrid runs in, sits
right across from Sparrow, who looks supremely bored.

                     MICHELLE
              (scanning the crowd)
          Those of you here because you care
          about the Formal, welcome. Those
          of you here because of Varshidi’s
          detention, I’ll give you a chance.
              (beat)
          But if you beef up my dance, I’ll end
          you, got it? Lookin at you, Sparrow.

Sparrow HUFFS and puts sunglasses on.

                     ASTRID
          Oh shit, tears??
              (beat, to Sparrow)
          Yo, she didn’t mean anything by it.
              (beat)
          Are you crying under there? Stop
          crying. It probably doesn’t
          matter, but maybe it does? So
          stop! Just in case.

Sparrow stares at her, intrigued. Clearly not crying.

                    SPARROW
          You’re a weird girl.
Astrid puts her head on her desk.


INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LIBBY’S LOCKER - DAY

Libby works on her locker combo as Astrid approaches.

                    ASTRID
          Well, I think my Sparrow
          deflowering dreams are done
          forever. But I do think I maybe
          saved his life, so there’s that...
                                                        40.


                     LIBBY
          Oh no! And cool?
              (beat)
          So I talked to Candace and kinda
          resolved some stuff.

                    ASTRID
          Ew, you talked to princess turd vomit?
          How was that?

                       LIBBY
          Fine.

                     ASTRID
          Fine?   That’s it?

                    LIBBY
          Yeah, it was fine. Cleared some
          stuff up. Fine.

                    ASTRID
          What’s that face?

                       LIBBY
          What face?

Libby opens her locker, GASPS and immediately slams it shut.
She takes a second look and closes the locker more quietly.

                     LIBBY (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          Um.. there’s a weird, glowing...
          vibrating...orb?...in there?

Astrid peeks in at what looks like a Bop-It floating within a
glowing gaseous sphere.

                    ASTRID
          Goddammit, Unicorn Boy. Way to
          pile it on. Can’t we just quietly
          ignore this all away?
                    LIBBY
          I don’t think so.

                    ASTRID
          Like we need another reason for
          everyone to think we’re freakshows.

                    MEAN KID WALKING BY
          You are freakshows.

As Libby stares at the Orb, a tiny compartment opens and a
teeny tiny doll-sized note falls out. Astrid grabs it-
                                                        41.


                    ASTRID
              (reading)
          Hello monster hunters-- Jesus--
          Use me to hold the 13 body parts
          needed to close the portal.

Beat as Astrid and Libby exchange a worried glance.

                      ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Step 1: retrieve the Tonton from
          the Tearjerker. And if you haven’t
          figured it out yet- follow your
          nose...and leg... AKA your new
          monster tracker superpowers!
               (beat)
          Seriously? These are the powers we
          get?

Libby picks up the Orb, turning it in her hands.

                    LIBBY
          How does this work?

Libby hits a button. A RED BEAM shoots out, landing on a FLY.
ALLOFASUDDEN, the fly GLOWS and grows to hamster size.

From the recoil, she hits another button. A BLUE BEAM zaps a
trashcan, making it DISAPPEAR.

They look at each other in SHOCK as the FLY ZOOMS out a window.

                    ASTRID
          I think you hit the wrong buttons.
          Time for some recon.

Libby nods in agreement. Astrid shoves the Orb into her bag.


EXT. STREETS OF COPPERS COVE - DAY

Libby and Astrid wander around town based on leg and nose
flashes. Using their journals to cross reference.

MONTAGE: TOWN SQUARE

                    ASTRID
          What does your leg say?

                    LIBBY
          I don’t know! What does your nose say?

SUBURBAN STREET
                                                        42.


                     LIBBY (CONT'D)
           Cold, cold, warm, warmer, hot, hot.

                     ASTRID
           Same! Man, these are the lamest
           supernatural powers ever.

THE PARK

                     LIBBY
           Ouch! Ow!!! Definitely this way.

They see a kid fall off his bike and cry. Astrid runs up-

                     ASTRID
           You better GROW A PAIR AND STOP
           CRYING, BUCKO!

Kid is like WTF, but it makes him stop.

SIDEWALK OUTSIDE SUN BUNS TANNING

Libby grabs her leg in pain.

                     LIBBY
           Okay well not sure why, but we
           gotta go in here.

                     ASTRID
               (sniffing)
           Yeah I’m getting that same burnt
           vinegar smell. Let’s do it.


INT. SUN BUNS TANNING SALON - LATER

Douchey fluorescent signs and aggressive lotion displays.
Think Miami Beach in the 80s. Grant sets up for the day.

Libby and Astrid walk in. Astrid clears her throat.
                     ASTRID
           Hello, we’d like to order two tans
           please.

                     GRANT
           Are you here from the high school?

The girls SIGH and reluctantly make the chomping Badger sign.

Grant hands them each a towel.

                     GRANT (CONT'D)
           Rooms C and D.
                                                           43.


INT. BACK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Libby and Astrid slink down the hallway, examining.

                    LIBBY
          Check things out, meet back in ten?

Thumbs up from Astrid. They peel off into separate rooms.

INTERCUT BETWEEN:

ASTRID’S TANNING ROOM

Astrid SNIFFS around, nada. Trail’s gone cold. Sees some
suntan lotions. Looks at the tanning machine. Hmm.

                    ASTRID
          When in Rome.

She strips down, puts on earbuds, gets into the tanning bed.

LIBBY’S TANNING ROOM

Libby starts opening drawers, nada. Then, she doubles over in
pain, her leg is throbbing.

HEARS CRYING. Oh shit, it’s coming from the next room.

NEXT DOOR TANNING ROOM

Libby enters, entranced as she sees the TEARJERKER,
headphones on and bopping his head to the beat, SCRAPE the
TEARS of A TANNING WOMAN with his 12-inch CLAW FINGERNAIL and
snort it like it’s cocaine.

LIBBY GASPS, which STARTLES the Tearjerker.

He turns toward her, delighted.

                    TEARJERKER
          Well look who it is. It’s my number
          one portal-opening party girl.

                       LIBBY
          No..I...

                    TEARJERKER
          I know you’re normally not invited
          to parties...
              (beat as Libby reacts)
          Oh no, did I hit a nerve?
              (excited)
          You’re not going to cry are you?
                                                           44.


Libby starts tearing up. Tearjerker wipes a tear with his
CLAW, LICKS IT.

                    TEARJERKER (CONT'D)
              (drug high)
          Shit that’s good.

                    LIBBY
              (through tears)
          Please...

Instantly, the Creature has her in a trance-like state.

                    TEARJERKER
          You don’t have to ask me twice.
          You know why you’re going to be
          extra yummy? Because you hate
          yourself... Sad tastes good, but
          worthless is delicious.

                       LIBBY
          I’m not...

                    TEARJERKER
          Sure you are, gf.

She slumps to the floor, SOBBING, unable to look away.

ASTRID’s ROOM

Astrid jams to relaxing music in her tanning bed, oblivious
that her purse is starting to VIBRATE and GLOW.

NEXT DOOR - LIBBY’S ROOM

The Tearjerker takes a GIANT LICK of her tears.

                    TEARJERKER (CONT'D)
          ...Just one more taste for daddy
          before we get started...
ASTRID’S ROOM

The VIBRATING gets more aggressive and Astrid’s tanning bed
starts to shake. WTF. She grabs the wildly vibrating Orb from
her purse, opens the door and sees CREEPY RED GLOWING LIGHT
coming from the hall.

                       ASTRID
          Libby!

LIBBY’S ROOM

Outside the door, Astrid BANGS and screams Libby’s name.
                                                        45.


But then we’re back with Libby - all we hear is Libby breathing
as the Tearjerker stares into her eyes, licking her tears.

                      TEARJERKER
            Ready to move the party to my crib?

But then!

Astrid BUSTS into the room with the Orb! She pushes a button - a
laser shoots out, EXPLODING THE CREATURE’S TONGUE, which sprays a
disproportionate amount of RED GOO directly onto the girls.

The Tanning Woman snaps out of her trance and RUNS out the door.

The Tearjerker’s TONGUE starts to regenerate in his mouth,
but Astrid has JUST enough time to grab Libby and HAUL ASS.

TANNING SALON LOBBY

Grant looks up just as Astrid and Libby, covered in RED GOO,
beeline for the front door. What the?

            ASTRID                           LIBBY
Lady problems.                   Homeopathic tanning lotion.

INT. LIBBY’S CAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Both girls are hyperventilating and COVERED IN GOO as Astrid
speed-drives them away. Libby is still coming to.

                      ASTRID
            He got away.

                      LIBBY
            You saved my life.

                      ASTRID
            I’m so so sorry. You were right,
            this shit’s real. It’s all real.
            Holy crap I’m so glad you’re okay.
            I was so scared I lost you.

Libby reaches out to squeeze Astrid’s hand.

                      ASTRID (CONT'D)
            What...happened in there?   You
            looked...so sad.

                      LIBBY
                (tearing up)
            It was awful. He told me the
            truth...what I already know... That
            I’m...worthless.
                                                           46.


Astrid pulls the car over and looks at her friend.

                    ASTRID
          Libby, you’re the farthest thing
          from worthless. You’re the most
          important person in my life.

                    LIBBY
              (in tears)
          Why do so many people keep saying
          it to me if it’s not true?

                    ASTRID
          Because some people are idiots. And
          that thing’s a monster. And you
          were the only person smart enough
          to see what was happening. And who
          could be worthless with such a
          badass leg cramp superpower?

Libby laughs and they hug.

                    ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Now, how do we kill this psycho
          buttface monster thing?

Libby pulls the pamphlet from her backpack, scanning.

                     LIBBY
          Okay, 13 monster body parts, place
          them in Orb, close the portal,
          yada, yada... Tearjerker! Found it,
          okay... Listen to this:
              (reading)
          Step 1: incapacitate Tearjerker,
          cut out his Tonton, Step 2: set him
          on fire...


INT. GIRLS LOCKER ROOM - LATER
Astrid finishes the pamphlet aloud as she and Libby wipe
themselves down with shitty locker room paper towels.

                    ASTRID
          Yep, “Cut out his Tonton, set him on
          fire.” Cool. Easy peasy. Clear as day.

                    BRUTUS
          I see you found what I left in your
          mailbox.

Both girls JUMP. Brutus is suddenly there.
                                                         47.


The creepy Giant Fly buzzes in and lands on his shoulder.

                    ASTRID
          It’s called a locker. And it’s
          extremely public.

Brutus hands them a bottle.

                    BRUTUS
          Just came to bring you this. Mix it
          with elephant tranquilizer. It’ll
          knock the Tearjerker right out.

                    LIBBY
          Elephant tranq-?

Astrid nods and winks “got this” at Libby, takes the bottle.

                    LIBBY (CONT'D)
          And, you sure he has Tate? And
          Valerie? And those other people
          who went missing?

                     BRUTUS
           Yes, but he distills victims for 48
           hours before he kills them.
               (off their confused look)
           To wring as much despair out of
           them as possible.
               (still confused)
           For when he drains and drinks all
           their remaining bodily fluids.
            ASTRID                            LIBBY
   (finally understanding)          (finally understanding)
Ah.                              Ah.
                     BRUTUS
          So you still have...
              (looking at his watch)
          8 hours left to get to them.
              (beat)
          And remember, if you don’t get the
          Tonton, you can’t close the portal
          and the world will die. Good luck!

He and the fly both disappear.


INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Libby and Astrid beeline down the hallway, passing Sparrow.

                     SPARROW
          Astrid.
                                                               48.


She stops and turns around.      Sparrow looks at her funny.

                       ASTRID
               (OMG)
           What?

                     SPARROW
           You have a little something in your
           hair...

He gestures toward her hair. She wipes the red goo, mortified.

                     SPARROW (CONT'D)
           Is that, blood?

                     ASTRID
           Um, I think so.

                       SPARROW
           Cool.

She smiles to herself and keeps running.

MONTAGE:

SCIENCE LAB

-Astrid picks the lock on the chem cabinet and mixes Methanol
and Propanoyl chloride into the BOTTLE Brutus gave them.

-Astrid runs to Frick’s desk, mouths “Sorry” in his direction,
shoves his precious PORTABLE BUNSEN BURNER into Libby’s
backpack. Several kids stare at them like they’re freaks.

BIKE RACK OUTSIDE SCHOOL

-Astrid grabs 2 helmets. Libby leaves several notes that say
“Will return your helmet, promise. Unless we’re dead.”

GAS STATION
-Libby fails at looking super nonchalant as she pumps some
gasoline into a Super Soaker Water Gun.

LIBBY’S BEDROOM

-They face Libby’s mirror, wearing every clothing item they
have, for padding. Plus kitchen gloves, stolen bike helmets and
each holding a water gun. They look like nerdy badasses.

END MONTAGE.
                                                 49.


INT. LIBBY'S BEDROOM - LATER

Libby is digging through her backpack.

                    ASTRID
          Steel dagger.

                    LIBBY
          Check.

                    ASTRID
          Turkey baster.

                     LIBBY
          Check. Last thing on the list.
          Think we’re finally ready.
              (beat)
          What if I’m not ready? I honestly
          don’t know if I can do this, Astrid.

                    ASTRID
          You’re stronger than you think.

Kaitlin pops her Blue-toothed head in.

                    KAITLIN
          Heard you and Sparrow had a real
          moment today.

                    LIBBY
          How do you-

                    KAITLIN
          I told you, I have eyes everywhere.


EXT. BEHIND THE PET STORE - NIGHT

The girls stand over a drainage grate.

                    ASTRID
          We sure this is it?

                    LIBBY
          Yeah, my leg is killing me.

Astrid deeply SNIFFS around.

                    ASTRID
          Yep, this is the spot. He can douse
          himself in all the Drakkar he
          wants, I can still smell him.

Libby removes the grate.
                                                        50.


                    LIBBY
          I’m scared.

                    ASTRID
          I’m right behind you. You and me,
          Libs. We’re the only ones who can
          save the world. Just us. Kinda
          cool when you think about it.

                    LIBBY
          Maybe being us ain’t so bad. Pudge
          Patrol, armed and ready for mega
          ass-kicking.

They strap on their night vision binocular goggles, high
five, then quietly slip under the grate and into the lair.


INT. MONSTER’S LAIR - SAME

Libby and Astrid peer around a wall. They see the victims in the
locked cell crying uncontrollably. Valerie can’t stop sneezing.

                    LIBBY
          Val! And, is that the tanning guy?

                    ASTRID
          I think so. Imma get into position.

Libby nods as Astrid hides behind some boxes.

Libby removes her night vision goggles, opens Brutus’s bottle
and uses a turkey baster to drip the liquid down her cheeks a
la tears. Then she waltzes out into the lair!

                    LIBBY
              (drama like soap opera)
          Oh, misery! These tears fall so
          freely from all the pain!!!!

                    TEARJERKER (O.S.)
          A surprise guest! Delightful!

ALLOFASUDDEN from behind her- champagne cork POPPING.

                    TEARJERKER (CONT'D)
          When the tears hit your fangs, it’s
          so good.

Tearjerker slowly approaches Libby. She TREMBLES, locked in
his gaze. She tilts her tear-soaked cheek in his direction.

                    TEARJERKER (CONT'D)
          Perhaps an aperitif before we spar?
                                                          51.


Tearjerker extends his giant prehensile tongue and slowly
laps her cheeks.

                    TEARJERKER (CONT'D)
          Yum. I’d love to take this to the
          next level. But first, a tune...

He clicks a button on his juke box.

German techno fills the space. The Tearjerker starts gyrating
and turns to face Libby. Why’s he wide awake!?!? And then -

He SLUMPS to the ground with a THUD.

                    LIBBY
          Oh, thank God.
Astrid runs back in.

                    ASTRID
          We gotta work fast.

                    LIBBY
          You go pick the lock, I guess I’ll
          start dissecting.

Libby kneels down beside the beast and cuts a square open on
his chest. She is immediately DOUSED with red goo. She GAGS.

                    LIBBY (CONT'D)
          Astrid, I need your help! I can’t
          see a thing and I’m totes gonna barf.

Astrid finishes picking the holding cell lock and runs up to
a confused and weak Tate.

                    ASTRID
          Quick, we don’t have much time.
              (pointing)
          Exit’s that way. I gotta finish this.
Astrid steps over dead Crying Woman and mouths “R.I.P.”


INT. LAIR HALLWAY - SAME

Tate, Valerie and Nigel rush down the hallway, their tears
finally slowing to a trickle.


INT. MONSTER LAIR - SAME

Astrid, now fully covered in GOO, holds up the Tonton.
                                                          52.


                    ASTRID
          Got it!

They drop it into the ORB, which beeps and whirs shut.

                    ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Look on the bright side, only 13
          more of these and we can close the
          portal...

                    LIBBY
          Great. Just in time for Formal.

Over the SLOW, MELANCHOLY Ursine Vulpine cover of Chris
Isaac’s Wicked Game:
The monster’s GIGANTIC eyes flip open, and the girls SCREAM!
As his tongue rapidly regenerates:

                    TEARJERKER
              (mumbled and subtitled)
          Now why’d you have to go ruin a
          perfectly good party?

He BOLTS upright, body and tongue healed. Huge Joker smile.
The girls are FROZEN.

                     TEARJERKER (CONT'D)
          You’ve made me mad. And do you
          know what I do when I get mad?
              (beat)
          I dance!

He jiggles around for a few seconds.

                    TEARJERKER (CONT'D)
              (patronizing)
          And then I dine.

He LUNGES at them, GROWLING and displaying GIANT FANG TEETH.
They all tumble to the floor, the Tearjerker on top of them.
He turns pointedly to Astrid.

                    TEARJERKER (CONT'D)
          I can see why your Mom is so deeply
          ashamed of you.

                    LIBBY
          No! Don’t listen to him!

Astrid starts to tear up.
                                                        53.


                    TEARJERKER
          That’s right. Lemme have it. Gimme
          your delicious tears, party girls.

He leans in to lap up the tears and -

                    LIBBY
          Wait!

Tearjerker is thrown by her ballsiness and he stops.

                    LIBBY (CONT'D)
          We’ll give you what you want, but...
          what’ll you do when we’re dead?
              (indicating the cell)
          Your second course is ruined.
He turns and is SHOCKED at the empty holding cell, releases
his grip, giving Astrid just enough leeway to scramble away.

He’s FURIOUS, lunges back down to Libby’s face and -- Astrid
SPRAYS him with the Super Soaker Water Gun full of gasoline.

The spray confuses him long enough that he release his grip
on Libby. He wipes his body, grimacing at the gasoline smell.

                    TEARJERKER
          I dislike this proof.

He then LUNGES FOR ASTRID - But-

Libby SPRAYS FIRE from the Portable Bunsen Burner, and the
Tearjerker BURSTS INTO FLAMES. As he shrinks down, burning
and dying, he CRIES A LOUD DESPERATE WAIL and CLUTCHES his
eyes, crying, finally evaporating into ash.

                     ASTRID
          I’ve officially decided parties are
          overrated.

EXT. PARKING LOT BEHIND PET STORE - SAME

Libby and Astrid are heavy breathing, covered in GOO, laying
next to Tate and a passed-out Valerie.

                    LIBBY
          Where’d the tanning dude go?

                     TATE
          Dunno. He ran off.
              (beat)
          What happened?
                                                        54.


                    LIBBY
          It’s a long story. Right now we
          just need to get you and Val home.

                       TATE
          Who’s Val?

                    ASTRID
              (incredulous)
          She goes to school with us.   She
          was at your party.

                       TATE
          Really?

                    LIBBY
          Maybe you need to get your head
          outta your ass.

                    TATE
          I don’t really know what to say.

                    ASTRID
          Well you could start by thanking us
          for drowning in monster guts to
          save your life. Don’t worry, we’re
          not gonna tell anyone. In fact,
          it’s probably a good idea if none
          of us talk about this...to anyone.

                    LIBBY
          Cover story. Good idea.

                     TATE
          Yeah sure, nobody would believe I
          spent more than five minutes with
          you guys anyway. We’re cool.
              (then)
          Also, thanks.

Libby and Astrid share a look: this freakin’ guy.

                    ASTRID
          Libby, could you pass me the Orb?

                       LIBBY
          Sure.

Libby passes it to her and “accidentally” hits the button,
dissolving a street lamp next to Tate. Who SHRIEKS and JUMPS.

                       LIBBY (CONT'D)
          Whoops.
                                                         55.


Libby and Astrid smile at each other.


INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY

Michelle and Varshidi at the podium, leading assembly.

                      MICHELLE
          You   guys picked a dumb theme for
          the   dance, even though I asked you
          not   to. So I chose something else.
          I’m   super stoked to announce the
          new   COOL theme...Angels & Demons!

                    ASTRID
          A little on the nose?

Libby laughs.

                    VARSHIDI
          And now, exciting announcement!
          Drum roll please, I’d like to
          welcome back to Promise... your
          favorite Badger... Tate Vanderberg!

Tate comes BURSTING through a sports entrance banner.

                    VARSHIDI (CONT'D)
          Look who’s alive, you guys!

Room ERUPTS with clapping, shouting, etc.

                     KIDS
          Speech!   Speech!    Speech!

Tate reluctantly grabs the mic.

                    TATE
          Uh, thanks guys. Super happy to be
          back. Yo, reminder to everyone to wear
          a helmet when you go bouldering!...
          I do have someone to thank...Couldn’t
          have done it without them....

He looks over at Libby and Astrid, who smile.

                    TATE (CONT'D)
          Candy, baby, will you come up here?

                    LIBBY
          I guess some things never change.

Candace BLUSHES and makes her way to the front, exchanging a
subtle glance with Libby as she passes. Astrid clocks this.
                                                        56.


                     ASTRID
              (loaded)
          Well some stuff changes.
              (beat)
          Like, I guess monsters are real.

                    LIBBY
          Yeah, I guess we’re monster hunters
          now. Arguably cooler than iguanas
          and Billy Eilish.

                    ASTRID
          I’m gonna get so much ass it’s
          gonna be freaky.

DUMB KID nearby.

                    DUMB KID
          You guys are freaky.

           ASTRID                            LIBBY
Thanks!                            Thanks!

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Valerie and Eggs wander by Libby’s locker.

                    VALERIE
          I had the weirdest dream I was in a
          drug den with a sexy monster.

Libby opens her locker, and a note falls out. Revealing a
sharp WEIRDLY SHAPED SWORD inside.

                    ASTRID
          Again with the locker, Brutus!?

Libby picks up the note and reads it aloud...

                     LIBBY
          Dear Hunters, we’ve had a breach.
          Keep eyes out for a Klorfus: A 999-
          toothed shapeshifter that flips its
          victims inside out. Xoxox, Brutus.
              (beat)
          He could maybe soften his delivery.

                    ASTRID
          I think there’s a photo on the back.

Libby turns over the note and both girls SCREAM.

                          END PILOT

                               TAG


INT. CHURCH REC ROOM - NIGHT

Christine organizes booklets, hears a noise from the chapel.


INT. CHAPEL - DAY

Christine pokes her head inside. It’s dark and empty. Hears
noise again so she walks in.

                    CHRISTINE
          Hello?

GROWLING from behind a pew.

                    CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
          Jamison if that’s you playing
          another one of your pranks, I will
          be forced to tell your mothe-

Suddenly, Christine sees SOMETHING WE DON’T SEE and drops to
her knees, raises her hands up-

                     CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
          Oh mighty lord and savior you have
          chosen me!
              (beat)
          What an...unusual looking angel of
          his mercy! Not at all what I
          expected but that is the magic of
          the lord. Oh heavenly father, you
          heard my prayers and are here to
          rid me of that evil teacher Jonas.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
              (haunting AF voice)
          I am here to serve.
FINIS.
