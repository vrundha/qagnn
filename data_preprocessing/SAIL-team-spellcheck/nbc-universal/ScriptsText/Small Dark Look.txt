    Caption: ‘The best way to stop a prisoner escaping is to make
    sure he never knows he is in prison’.

    Fyodor Dostoevsky

    Over black we hear a hoarse voice whisper in Russian and see
    a subtitle.

                        VOICE (OOV)
              (Dear God. Before you take my soul.
              Give me the strength to do this).

1   INT. SECURE WARD, PRISON HOSPITAL - DAWN                     1

    A plastic cigarette lighter is lit.




                                   R
    Into the flame light comes the heel of a shoe held by the
    shaking hand of an old man. The hands and wrists have




                                  U
    bracelet tattoos.          AT
    A face leans into the light to see the black smoke begin to
    curl up from the heel of the shoe. Then drops of black melted
    rubber begin to drip from the shoe into a ceramic cup. The
    cup, the face and the hands are striped by orange light
                        FE

    coming from a light gantry outside. Rain dribbles on a barred
    window.

    We study the face in the light of the lighter. Wizened, in
    great pain but determined, with straggly grey hair. This man
                S


    is GORNI ZYKOV. The lighter could be a candle in an Old
    Masters painting, the face looks like a face from Rembrandt.
               U




    As the rubber drips Zykov reaches into the half light and
    gropes to find the tube of a CATHETER, which enters his penis
           C




    (out of shot) under his white robe (his crumpled robes look
    like a shroud in the half light). We now see that Zykov is
    FO




    lying in a hospital bed...

    He extracts the end of the catheter from a plastic flask
    attached to a drip scaffold and puts it into the cup. He
    grunts a little to release some urine. Urine flows through
    the catheter tube into the cup and mixes with the black
    melted rubber.

    Zykov gasps in pain and swirls the mixture.

    The lighter and a hand find a needle from a syringe hidden
    under a pillow. Zykov’s shaking hand grabs it and he lies
    back on the bed, striped by bars from above. He takes a deep
    breath and then pulls away the bed sheet.

    We see that his body has many tattoos, swirls and crosses and
    stars, but they flash in and out of the light.

    He begins to dig the tip of the needle into his own flesh.
    Once, twice, three times, as if injecting compulsively but
    never piercing the skin all the way. He curls to survey his
    work as blood pimples appear and he wipes the blood away on
    the sheet.

    We will learn he is working on a home made tattoo.

    He continues to prick and wipe his skin in a pattern which
    for now only he understands - dipping cotton wool into the
    jet black sludge of rubber and urine and applying the sludge




                                               ES
    to the pin pricks, to dye the subcutaneous layer.

    He grunts in pain as the urine and rubber sting.




                                   R
    Daylight begins to appear at the barred window as he works,
    and we begin to see Cyrillic letters emerging in black on his
    skin - ‘C A W...’




                                  U
    Birds begin to sing the dawn chorus. Daylight illuminates the
                               AT
    scene and we read the Russian name ‘C A W A’ (SACHA) tattooed
    on Zykov’s thigh. He uses the white sheet to wipe the excess
    of the mixture away.
                        FE

    Zykov uses a polished metal needle tray as a mirror to check
    his work. When he is satisfied he lies back on the pillow and
    sighs. All his strength has gone and his life is dribbling
    away.
                S


    The freed catheter begins to dribble urine onto the floor.
               U



    Zykov looks to the barred window one last time and hears
    birds singing. He takes a breath then reaches for the
    emergency cord, which he pulls. Then his eyes close and the
           C




    catheter flow reduces to a drip, drip, drip.

    Deafening noise. A ROAD DRILL begins to dig up the frozen
    earth as if it were concrete. Grey daylight.

    A traditional, onion-domed Russian orthodox church sits in a
    snow covered graveyard on the outskirts of Moscow. In the
    distance high-rise tower blocks are shrouded in frozen fog.

    Gravestones protrude from a thick quilt of fog as the GRAVE          *
    DIGGERS drill in the shadow of the church. Iron and steel
    ring out in the bitter cold.

3   INT. SMALL HOME NEAR RUSSIAN GRAVEYARD, KITCHEN - DAY            3

    We hear the road drill digging in the distance. Gorni Zykov,
    the old man we saw in jail, is lying dead and naked on a
    table.

    We study his lifeless body for a moment, lit by the grey             *
    light. We revisit the tattoos and glimpse the name ‘SACHA’.
    Other tattoos tell the story of his life, in the style of the
    Vory v Zakone. He has a faded star above his heart. A
    crucifix is tied to his right wrist and rests in his frozen
    grip.

    Then a door opens and three priests carrying incense enter.




                                                    ES
    The road drill wheezes, stops and starts outside. The priests
    stand around the body and then there is a knock at the door.
    The OLDEST PRIEST gestures toward the door.

    suitcase, which he places on the floor beside the body.

    The oldest of the priests is running hot water from a tap at
    the sink into a plastic bowl a little way behind the body.

    A second priest hands Gregory a white cloth. Gregory waits           *
    for the second bowl of hot water to be handed to Vladimir. A         *
    priest gestures for them to begin.

    Gregory soaks his cloth in the hot water and looks at his            *
    brother. They begin to wash their father’s body.                     *

    The priests glance at each other. Vladimir looks down at the
    body, unsure. Quietly to Gregory,

                          VLADIMIR
                Do they expect us to wash his dick?
                Because I’m not fucking touching my
                dad’s dick.
                       Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)              4.


The short priest reacts a little. Gregory speaks evenly to
his brother without averting his eyes from the body.

                    GREGORY
          Vova, the short one speaks English.

The short priest reacts a little. Vladimir shrugs. He begins
to giggle - a bit freaked out. Gregory splashes his cloth on
Zykov’s chest and steam rises.

The Priests leave. Gregory continues to clean the body and
Vladimir watches them exit.

Gregory picks up the brand new black suitcase. He flicks it

open. The open suitcase contains a brand new expensive suit
of clothes with a pair of shiny shoes on the top.

Vladimir takes a breath and now the priests are gone his

emotion wells up. He stands motionless with his head down.
Steam rises from the hot water in the bowls and on the body.




                                U
Gregory looks up and sees the tears on Vladimir’s face. He
pulls up a chair and offers for Vladimir to sit.

Vladimir sits and puts his face in his hands. As he sobs
silently, Gegory takes out the shoes then pulls out a crisp
white shirt and lets it unfold. He takes a pin from the
collar of the new shirt and puts it between his lips and
interrupts...

tears away. Then takes a last look.                            *

    A funeral procession consisting of three priests, two grave
    diggers, Gregory, Vladimir, and a stray dog which is yapping.

    The road drill is steaming in the snow. Zykov’s coffin is
    carried through the graveyard on the shoulders of the              *

Vladimir is freezing and Gregory is impassive, he lights a
cigarette. The priest hurries to the other priests and

    Gregory turns and goes to get out of the car. It becomes            *
    clear now that Vladimir feels vulnerable without the
    protection and counsel of his older brother.

    Gregory has always run the family business and so far only
    delegated minor, non criminal, responsibilities to Vladimir.
    Returning to London alone makes Vladimir nervous...

    Forty people are gathered for the wake, families with
    children or men alone. A table has been set up for canapés          *
    and waiters in starched uniforms serve the guests.

    The men wear black ties and the women wear sable. At first
    they look like members of the British establishment, but look
    closer and it should become apparent that the men in here are
    gangsters, Turkish, Russian and Serbian.

9   INT. RUSSIAN RESTAURANT, SIDE ROOM - DAY                         9

    Vladimir is smartly dressed. Sober. He peers through a crack
    in the door from a private side room.

    He spots a huddle of Russian men sitting in a corner, deep in
    conversation, then sees three Turkish men in conversation at
    another table. One of the Russians breaks off and heads for
    the Turkish group with a piece of paper folded in his hands.
    He gives the piece of paper to the Turks and a discussion
    begins.

    Vladimir doesn’t like these machinations going on all around
    him and without Gregory.                                             *

     Vladimir and an army of cleaners are cleaning and
     straightening up the house. Leon is sweeping up broken glass
     and the place is a hive of activity. Vladimir sees a car pull
     up outside and hurries to the door.

     He unlocks the door and lets Gregory in. Vladimir puts his
     arm around Gregory and speaks softly as they walk through the
     frantic clean up....

     hangs and there is a bullet hole in the wall beside it. The
     blood has all been cleaned up.

     He goes to a small safe and dials a code to open it.              *

     He then opens up his small black suitcase. The icon is inside
     and it glows in the flickering light. Gregory stares at it
     and we might sense he feels a connection with its weary
     sadness.

     expression. The same look of disappointment and accusation.

     his father brought with him from Russia) and lays it down and

     Then we see a shadow and then see Luda walking between the
     graves, glancing at a map of famous grave stones. She checks
     the inscriptions and finally finds the tomb of someone called
     Theophilius Carter, who died in 1904.

     There is a tea pot on the grave. Luda looks around once and
     then takes a small envelope from under her coat. She places
     it in the teapot.

     Monty hits the brakes hard and skids to a halt. He turns off
     the music and the wind moans. He looks all around at the
     empty desolation. Not even a barn to mark the spot.

     Monty checks a scrap of paper on which he has written some
     GPS coordinates. From the glove compartment of his car, Monty
     takes out a house brick.

     We see Monty getting out of the car with the envelope in one
     hand and the brick in the other.

     He walks forward a few paces then carefully places the
     envelope down under the brick on the white line in the middle
     of the road (we infer he is following an instruction). He
     glances around for someone or something, but the hedges and       *
     fields seem empty.

     He walks back to his car and gets inside. He fires his engine
     and slowly reverses away from where the envelope has been
     left.

     Monty drives away.

     The envelope is under the brick and   the wind tugs at it.
     After only a moment a battered Land   Rover appears from a dirt

     shooed out of the vehicle. The dog comes around to the
     envelope and begins to sniff it. Satisfied, the dog sits.

     the Land Rover and squats down.

     He runs the Geiger counter over the envelope and it stays
     even. Satisfied that it is ok, Hunan pulls on a surgical

     As Hunan drives up the long drive, we see security cameras
     following his progress.

     Two heavy looking ex-FSB security men guard the door with
     guns hidden. Hunan pulls up in front of the door and gets out
     of the Land Rover with the envelope. We might notice a sentry
     on guard on the roof of the nearby building.

     well and defer to him. He punches a security code into a
     keypad beside the front door.

     flickering.

     The upper room has been turned into an observatory with a
     glass domed roof. The telescope is pointed at the sky. The
     room is empty though a cigarette still burns in an ashtray.

     ‘Library’. Hunan glances at the smouldering cigarette and
     guesses.

     Hunan turns and places the envelope beneath the telescope.
     He walks.

     Once again we stay with the envelope for a moment. We hear
     Hunan’s footsteps as he descends and hear a door close. Only
     then does Natasha Dubinsky emerge.

     saw, and thinner. She may not have slept and we might imagine
     she spent the night gazing at the stars. We sense someone
     alive furiously inside her own head.

     She opens a drawer and takes out some white gloves, of the
     kind used for handling very old manuscripts. She then opens
     up the envelope and stares at the photograph of the icon.

     In a sunlit gallery we find Professor Monty Dark sitting on a
     bench, staring at Manet’s ‘Portrait of Mademoiselle Claus’.

     After a moment Luda enters and walks to the painting. The
     painting is a rendezvous and Luda quickly identifies Monty
     Dark and sits down on the bench.

          She reminds me of my client. I was
          in her presence only once. She was
          on the balcony of her house. She
          has a telescope and she stares at
          the stars all night long. When she
          looks at you it’s as if you are as
          far away from her as a star.

     We join Gregory as he peers down at the parents departing
     with goody bags. Cars pull away. Then, over their heads, he
     sees a long black Bentley pulling up.

     The driver of the Bentley gets out and opens the rear door. A
     wiry Turkish man with a thick moustache gets out and buttons
     his camel hair coat. A few moments later an empty hearse
     pulls up.

     Gregory reaches for his revolver and slips it into his
     jacket. He gets to his feet. At that moment Vladimir bursts
     in, his wig in his hand.

89   INT. NOTTING HILL HOME, KITCHEN - DAY                          89

     In the kitchen it all happens fast.

     The substitute clown is drunk with his head on the table. But
     the gun shot brings him to his feet. The moment he enters
     Gregory shoots the clown twice in the face.

     Vladimir is close and Gregory pushes him down the cellar
     steps. Vladimir falls hard down the stone steps into
     darkness.

     When Tashkar enters he sees the substitute clown lying dead,
     his face blown apart by the two bullets. Gregory has his arm
     over his face in grief.

     Tashkar growls and points the gun again at the dead clown’s
     face and pumps more bullets into his head (making him more
     unrecognisable).                                                 *

     After a moment the smoke clears. Tashkar stares at the body
     then looks to Gregory, who removes his arm and takes a breath
     to hold back tears.

                         GREGORY
               It is done. Leave me the fuck
               alone.

     Gregory falls to his knees and hugs the bloody body, blood
     pooling all around the clown. Gregory pulls back, covered in




                                                  ES
     blood...

     down and speaks in Turkish.

Hunan hardly reacts when he sees the mess in the room. He       *

may be a relatively regular occurrence.                         *

Gregory’s face is made of stone as Tashkar arrives and holds
out a gloved hand. As the other mourners look on, Gregory
takes his hand and they shake. People react with some
astonishment.

      Monty starts throwing anything he can find at her, she fights     *
      him off, he grabs her and starts to throttle her. In his          *
      desperate frenzy he is too strong for her. She is starting to     *
      pass out. She clambers and reaches for something to stop him.     *
      It’s getting worse, she’s losing her strength. She reaches        *
      up, grasping for anything.                                        *

      From the sink she grabs a hair dryer. They struggle, bottles      *
      smash. Monty tightens his grip around her neck, choking her.      *
      Luda pulls the hair dryer to the floor and smacks him over        *
      the head a couple of times - he starts to loosen his grip.        *
      Luda takes advantage, manages to flip him and get her knee on     *
      his chest as he yells and grunts and struggles.                   *

      With one hand she grabs Monty’s balls and squeezes. He yells,     *
      open mouthed. Luda pushes the hair dryer into his mouth,          *
      switches it on, blasting hot air at full speed.                   *

      Monty gulps in agony as the scalding air fills his lungs.         *
      His chest expands and his eyes almost burst from his head.        *
      Luda turns up the dial, blasting more hot air. Monty is now       *
      almost unconscious, desperately trying to take oxygen into        *
      his burnt lungs. He tries to make a noise but can’t. He stops     *
      moving, his eyes stare. Blood trickles from his mouth. Luda       *
      stands and leaves the bathroom leaving the dead Mad Hatter on     *

      Gregory is still sitting at the table, alone in his vigil. He
      is smoking a cigarette. Time has passed. There are many more
      butts in the ashtray. The bottle of vodka less full.

141   INT. ‘TOLSTOI’ TRAIN, COMPARTMENT / EXT. TRAIN STATION - 141
      NIGHT

      In shadows and the flash of passing lights we can just make
      out Vladimir’s sleeping face on the top bunk inside the small
      sleeper compartment. Sacha beneath him on the bottom bunk.
      The train begins to brake sharply and the grind of the wheels
      makes Vladimir’s eyes flicker open.

      He sits up as the train begins to slow to a halt. He looks a
      little dishevelled but he wipes his face with his hand and
      gets off the bed. The space is cramped.

      He reaches into his jacket and slips his pistol under the




                                                ES
      thin mattress.

      Outside the window we see the train platform as the train
      slows down. We glimpse the border crossing between Russia and




                                     R
      Finland illuminated in bright white lights in the near
      distance. Garish advertisements for cheap drinks and tobacco
      slip by slowly. Train guards, police and Border Patrol stroll




                                    U
      around the platform. Vladimir gently wakes Sasha who rouses,
      bleary eyed.

      The train finally stops with a jerk and we hear whistles and
      voices from the platform. Vladimir takes an envelope in his
      hand and sits on Sasha’s bed. Sasha slowly sits up. Vladimir
                          FE

      whispers and begins to empty the envelope into his hand.

      Sacha glances at his own photo beside a false name and
      reacts. From the envelope Vladimir pulls out a leaflet
      advertizing a circus in Helsinki. We glimpse pictures of
      clowns and elephants...

We can hear Border Patrol officers boarding the train and
knocking doors further down the corridor. Sacha looks scared
and whispers. Vladimir hushes him (we are finding that          *
Vladimir is good when he is in charge).

knock at the door. Two Russian Border police are in the

      bullet meant for Sacha in his chest but his momentum knocks
      the assassin off his feet.

      Vladimir lands on top of the assassin and using his brutal,
      animal strength he begins to choke the life out of the him.
      The assassin fires another bullet into Vladimir and he growls
      like a bear. He pulls the gun away from the assassin and
      shoots him once in the head. Blood splatters up the window of

      She is still on her cell. She fights tears. She starts the        *
      car and drives off.                                               *

      A pause as they share the silence. Luda looks at Sasha and        *
      begins to laugh and cry. She speaks into the phone.               *

153   INT. NOTTING HILL HOME, DRAWING ROOM - MORNING              153

      Gregory hears and we see he has swallowed all emotion. He
                  S


      speaks softly.
                 U



                          GREGORY
                Thank you Luda.                                         *

      A pause. He cuts the call. As the birds sing we are left with
      Gregory sitting alone, staring ahead. Then he picks up the
      FO




      phone and begins to dial.


154   INT. MOSCOW. GOVERNMENT STAFF CAR - MORNING                 154

      The Interior Minister is being driven through the streets of
      Moscow in a Government car. His cellphone rings. He checks
      the number and looks puzzled. He takes the call...


155   INT. NOTTING HILL HOME, KITCHEN - MORNING                   155

      Gregory is on his cellphone, staring ahead.
                     Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)              113.


                     GREGORY
           I didn’t kill Dubinsky because it
           would have been a mistake.

Gregory peeks between net curtains at the grey London day...

                     GREGORY (CONT'D)
           She is no threat to you. She is
           more use to you alive than dead.

He goes to the coffee machine and pours himself a cup...

                     GREGORY (CONT'D)
           She has contacts with every




                                            ES
           dissident in the world. Numbers,
           names and addresses. She has asked
           me to work with her. She trusts me.
           I will say yes.




                                  R
Gregory talks on as if over-riding interruption.




                                 U

Gregory drops sugar lumps into his coffee with a steady hand.

                     GREGORY (CONT'D)
           I want to offer you a deal,
           Minister.

Gregory sips his coffee.

                     GREGORY (CONT'D)
           Tell the Fisherman I will report on
       C




           Dubinsky and your other enemies. I
           will make London safe for our
FO




           friends.

A pause.

                     GREGORY (CONT'D)
           But I must be allowed to stay here.
           I must remain here as King.

We may believe Gregory’s desire for power has consumed him.
His empire will grow. We study his soldier face. He cuts the
call.



                    THE END
