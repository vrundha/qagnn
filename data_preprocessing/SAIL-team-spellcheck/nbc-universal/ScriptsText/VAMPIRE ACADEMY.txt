  INT. CHANGING SALON - NIGHT

  Tulle. Satin. A pin in the hair, a bauble in the ear. Bubbles
  of champagne and perhaps even the smoking remnants of a joint
  in a nearby dish by a Victorian setee.

  Camera REVEALS two fresh-faced young women in front of a long
  mirror. ROSE MARIE HATHAWAY, 18, and VASILISSA DRAGOMIR
  (LISSA), 18, formally dressed and elegant.

  Could be a Jane Austen movie except no empire waists, and...

                      ROSE
            I look like a fucking macaroon.

  She downs her champagne. Lissa, used to Rose saying it like
  it is, plops a sparkling tiara on Rose’s head.

                      LISSA
            And now you look like a princess.

                      ROSE
                (holding up her glass)
            If I were a princess, the champagne
            wouldn’t be empty.

                      LISSA
            Allow me, Your Highness.

  She fills their glasses, laughing as the bubbles spill over.
  Rose sips the champagne before it overflows her glass, the
  tiara slipping as she bends over. She pulls it off --

                      ROSE
            How do you even wear this thing? I
            just lost a hundred strands.

  -- and places it on the head of its rightful owner.

                      LISSA
            Heavy is the head, thin is the
            hair.

  Now they’re back at the mirror for last looks. Two lovely
  young women, best friends at the prime of their lives.

                       LISSA (CONT'D)
            Rose, if anyone looks like a
            macaroon, it’s me. You look
            beautiful.

  Rose smiles her thanks. Playing dress-up isn’t her thing, but
  she knows she looks good.
VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21)                   2.


                      ROSE
            We look beautiful, Lissa. Head to
            toe.

  Rose lifts the skirts of her party dress to reveal a well-
  worn pair of shit-kicker boots.

                      ROSE (CONT'D)
            Let’s party.

  Lissa grins and raises her glass. As they CLINK --

  EXT. ROYAL PALACE - NIGHT

  The FLASH of a PHOTOGRAPHER’S BULB as dozens of decked out
  partygoers move up the carpet-lined stone staircase that
  leads to an enormous CASTLE, lit up for a gala.

  Jewels and gowns and bespoke tuxedos abound as the arrivals
  are projected onto a wall that lines the street -- this
  kingdom’s version of E! Red Carpet Arrivals.

  A parade of LIMOUSINES crawls towards the entrance.

  EXT. CASTLE GATES - NIGHT

  A massive gate marks the entrance of St. Vladimir’s Royal
  Court. The seat of the MOROI VAMPIRE KINGDOM. The castle
  glitters high in the distance as the taillights of limos head
  up the hillside.

  INSIDE the gates, in position, are FIVE DHAMPIR GUARDIANS.

  The night is quiet. Perhaps too quiet. One of the Guardians
  squints. Is something out there?

  REVERSE to show nothing but wooded fields and a long lonely
  road. We’re in the middle of nowhere.

  INT./EXT. LIMO - NIGHT

  At the castle, a window lowers to reveal VICTOR DASHKOV, 50s.
  Handsome and sophisticated. A GUARDIAN peers in.

                      VICTOR
            Victor Dashkov.

  Victor’s eyes FLASH GOLD -- the Royal calling card for entry.

                      VICTOR (CONT'D)
            My daughters. Sonya Karp. Mia Karp.

  Inside, SONYA, 23, quiet, careful, and decidedly odd, flashes
  her eyes. However hers flash SILVER.
VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21)                   3.


                      GUARDIAN
            One Royal Moroi, one non. And the
            third?

  MIA, 18, sits back in her seat. Refusing to play.

                       VICTOR
            Mia...

                      MIA
            The Guardians make us suffer
            through this every time.

                      VICTOR
            It’s security protocol.

                      MIA
            It’s humiliating.

                      SONYA
                (don’t make a scene)
            Only if you care about such things.

                      MIA
            How can they not know who I am?

                      VICTOR
            Mia, darling. Be a sport.

  Annoyed, Mia flashes her eyes at the Guardian. Silver.

                       GUARDIAN
                (ticking the box)
            Non-Royal.

                      MIA
                (sharp)
            Not for long.

  They disembark from the car heading for the red carpet as we
  DRONE UP to see the castle in all its glory.

  INT. BALLROOM - PALACE - NIGHT

  ECU ON a silver swizzle stick with a razor sharp tip as it
  pricks a finger. As the blood pools on the tip -- WIDEN to
  reveal a SEXY BARTENDER, who allows the DROP OF BLOOD to fall
  in like a maraschino cherry. Rose grabs it and a blood-free
  glass with one hand. In her other are two more flutes.

  As she moves through the majestic ballroom in search of
  Lissa, we see the party through her eyes, a classy but sexy
  mash up of Royal fantasy and Studio 54.
VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21)                      4.


  A stunningly dressed WOMAN magically makes her fingertips
  emit a shower of sparks, the embers lighting up the air.

  **Note: Every Moroi vampire, whether Royal or not, is able to
  perform basic Elemental Magic. Nothing too strong -- the
  equivalent of a parlor trick. We will call them Fire Users,
  Water Users, Earth Users, Air Users.**

  A WATER USER in a LIME GREEN METALLIC SUIT and hair to match
  waves his hand over a martini glass, causing the gin to swirl
  and part until the olive is free to be plucked out.

  A bevy of Young Royals gather around an elaborate water pipe;
  a Fire User using magic to heat it, as a Water User spins the
  vapor into various shapes before being inhaled.

  Through partially closed velvet curtains, we catch a glimpse
  of two ROYAL MOROI PARTYGOERS exposing their FANGS and
  sinking their teeth into the neck of a rapturous HUMAN. As
  the human lets his head fall back in ecstasy...

  Rose passes a line of Guardians, holding her foot out like a
  handshake to MIKHAIL, 20s, who slyly taps her boot with his
  similar one as a hello. The humorless ALBERTA, 30s, scolds:

                      ALBERTA
            Rose. Behave.

                      ROSE
                (never)
            Always, Alberta.

  As Rose continues on, linger with Alberta and Mikhail.

                      ALBERTA
            Don’t encourage her.

                      MIKHAIL
            She’s the guest of a Moroi
            Princess. Let her have some fun.

                      ALBERTA
            Guardians are not here to have fun.

                      MIKHAIL
            She’s a Novice. Cut her some slack.

                      ALBERTA
            The last thing Rose Hathaway needs.

  Mikhail spots Sonya entering. His eyes light up, but one look
  from Alberta keeps him firmly in his place.
VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21)                   5.


  Mia falls in beside Sonya as her eyes scan the party. Victor
  already pressing flesh in the background. As Sonya clocks a
  ROYAL IN FULL MARIE ANTOINETTE drag, including a bird cage
  holding a live finch in her wig --

                      MIA
            I don’t see Andre --

                       SONYA
                (voice raised)
            A BIRD IS NOT A TOY.
                (then)
            Perhaps you should activate your
            stalker beacon.

                      MIA
                (embarrassed by Sonya)
            It’s not stalking if one’s engaged.

                      SONYA
                (correcting her)
            Promised --

                       MIA
            Promised to be engaged.
                (then)
            Don’t be jelly, Sonya. It doesn’t
            suit you. Although, not much does.

  She wanders off, leaving Sonya unfazed and unaware of
  Mikhail’s eyes on her from afar.

  A Queen’s FOOTMAN passes her rolling an enormous CAKE past
  portraits of the QUEEN from her teenage years spanning
  decades -- and clusters of Royals in heated political debate.
  Beneath the frothy facade lay deep divisions.

  Finally the Footman approaches the Queen herself, ancient but
  stately, as she receives the DRAGOMIR FAMILY: Lissa, her
  charismatic brother ANDRE and their PARENTS.

                      THE QUEEN’S ANCIENT HERALD
            The Dragomirs, Your Majesty.

  The Queen waves him away from her ear, annoyed.

                      QUEEN
            Clarence would introduce his mother
            to his father. How are my
            delightful Dragomirs?

                      LISSA’S DAD
            Pleased to be celebrating your
            200th birthday, Your Majesty.
VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21)                    6.


  Andre bows to her, all charm.

                      ANDRE
            Happy Birthday, Fair Lady. You
            don’t look a day over eighty.

                      QUEEN
            Andre, my dear, you’re a cheeky
            rascal. And a lovely liar.

  Having finally spotted him, Mia steps in next to Andre,
  sliding her hand through his arm as she curtsies --

                      MIA
            Happy Birthday from me as well,
            Your Majesty.

  The Queen’s eyes glide over hers to find Lissa behind her.

                      QUEEN
            Ah, Princess Vasilissa, the angel
            to your brother Andre’s devil.

                      LISSA
            He is shameless, Your Majesty.
                (teasing)
            How shall he be punished?

                      QUEEN
            Being King of the Commonwealth will
            be punishment enough.

  Andre’s eyes catch a beautiful woman’s across the room. This
  is TATIANA, 25. All lips and legs and brains. Noticing --

                      QUEEN (CONT'D)
            Though surely he’ll find something
            to cheer him once he’s king.

                      VICTOR
                (approaching)
            Now Your Majesty, you know there
            will have to be an actual election.

  Victor places a hand on Mia’s shoulder. Centering her.

                      QUEEN
            Pfft, a formality. Who would deny
            me my pick for successor?

  As the Dragomir’s greet Victor warmly, and the adults chatter
  about politics, Mia’s sharp gaze lands on --
VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21)                      7.


  Tatiana eye-fucking Andre from afar. After giving him a
  subtle head tilt, Tatiana turns away, passing --

  Rose, who finally spots Lissa making a beeline for her.

                      LISSA
            Bubbles, perfect.

  She takes two glasses from Rose just as she’s BUMPED by a
  CARELESS PARTYGOER. One glass slips, but Rose’s free hand
  shoots out with supernatural speed, catching it mid-air.

                       LISSA (CONT'D)
            Nice.

  Calling after the sloppy party-goer --

                      ROSE
            Excuse you!

  The Partygoer shoots some sparks into the air with his finger
  spelling “sorry, Rose.” As the girls laugh MARIE CONTA,
  middle-aged Royal, stares at Rose, sniping to another ROYAL.

                      MARIE
            What are the Dragomir’s thinking
            letting Lissa invite that girl
            everywhere she goes? A Guardian’s
            place is at the gates.

  EXT. GATES - NIGHT

  POV from the woods towards the gates. Perhaps something IS
  out there. Watching. Waiting.

  CLOSE on a GUARDIAN as his head SNAPS to attention. What did
  he just hear? He motions to his PARTNERS. Two of them fall
  into flank position immediately, withdrawing SILVER STAKES
  from their weapon belts. As the gates start to open --

  INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

  WHOOSH! Music plays as A ROYAL MOROI waves their hand over
  the enormous cake and its 200 candles ignite in FIRE.

  Rose and Lissa gently push through the crowd to get a better
  view as the Queen steps up to her cake, aided by Victor. Mia
  lingers behind her father, looking around for Andre.

                      ROSE
            Looks like Mia lost her prince.
VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21)                      8.


                      LISSA
            I’m amazed she let him out of her
            sight long enough to lose him.
                (speaking of)
            Where is Andre?

                                                    CUT TO:

  INT. COAT CHECK - NIGHT

  Andre has Tatiana pressed up against the wall, hidden by
  hanging coats as they fuck in the coat check. The sound of
  voices singing Happy Birthday (Moroi-style) startles him.

                      ANDRE
            Shit. I have to go --

  He tries to pull away, but she tightens her grip until they
  both finish. Then, both catching their breaths --

                      TATIANA
            Never leave a girl undone, Andre.
            Not even for the Queen.

  As he pulls himself together --

                      ANDRE
            Lovely to meet you...?

                       TATIANA
            Tatiana.

  He grins, then dashes out, disappearing around the bend of a
  long hallway just as we CUT TO:

  EXT. GATES - NIGHT

  Three Guardians move across the road as a unit. Movement in
  the grasses lining the road grabs one Guardian’s attention --

  -- as a black BIRD takes flight from the brush, its wings
  flapping in the startled Guardian’s face.

  He relaxes, sheaths his stake. He turns to the others, when --

  WHAM! Something HITS him hard, tackling him. We hear SNARLS.

                       GUARDIAN
            STRIGOI!

  INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

  Andre hurries up to a prime spot near the Queen just as the
  birthday song finishes. He throws Rose and Lissa a wink.
VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21)                    9.


  The old Queen struggles to blow out the candles. Giving up,
  she closes her eyes. An unseen WIND begins to blow, building
  until every last candle has gone out. Over hearty applause --

                      QUEEN
            I may be older than iron, but I can
            still work my way around Elemental
            Magic.

                      CROWD MEMBER
            Air Users Forever!

  That starts the rest of the crowd shouting, Earth Users, Fire
  Users, Water Users. As the chanting takes on a rancorous
  edge, Andre looks to the Queen for permission to address the
  crowd. At her nod, he steps forward.

                      ANDRE
            Yes. Air Users Forever — and don’t
            forget Water Users Forever —
                (Water Users cheer)
            And what about Earth Users and Fire
            Users?

  More cheers. Near the Queen, HIGH PRIESTESS IRENA, 50s,
  clever and political, pipes up:

                      HIGH PRIESTESS IRENA
            Ever the politician, Andre. Can’t
            you choose one?

  The crowd titters nervously. These two don’t see eye to eye.
  Then, Andre, effortlessly charming, and entirely sincere --

                      ANDRE
            Irena, how can I choose my right
            hand over my left? My heart over my
            brain? Alone, they’re weak.
            Together they’re strong. A strong
            state cares for all its citizens.

                      MARIE CONTA
                (pointed)
            Define citizens?

  Andre looks at Lissa and Rose, both watching him, rapt.

                      ANDRE
            Those we walk through life with,
            shoulder to shoulder. Those we
            love, no matter our differences.
            Those we fight for.
                (to Rose)
            And those who fight for us.
VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21)                  10.


  Though Marie and Irena don’t look happy, Victor and the Queen
  exchange a proud look.

                      ANDRE (CONT'D)
            To me, that sounds like everyone in
            this room. The Royal Moroi who
            value our heritage. The Non-Royal
            Moroi who keep our society going.
            And... the Dhampir Guardians, of
            whom we expect so much.

  Surprised murmurs from the Moroi. As the Guardians try to
  cover their shock at being honored, Andre makes his point --

                      ANDRE (CONT'D)
            We share the same history. We fight
            the same enemy. And the Strigoi
            don’t care if we’re Royal or Non-
            Royal Moroi, or if we’re half
            Moroi, half human like the Dhampir
            Guardians. They want us all dead.
                (to the now hushed crowd)
            Like these two hands, and like this
            head and this heart, imagine what
            we could achieve if we faced the
            future as one kingdom, united.

  A silent beat -- followed by thunderous applause. Lissa and
  Rose beam, as Tatiana watches, a sly smile on her lips. Then:

                      QUEEN
                (teasing Andre)
            What a scene stealer you are. And
            what happened to the music? I
            thought this was a party!

  The crowd cheers, MUSIC RISES. Hundreds of rose petals fall
  as the party kicks in to high gear and as Lissa pulls Rose to
  the dance floor, not a care in the world, INTERCUT:

  EXT. GATES - NIGHT

  The Guardians are fighting something ferocious, silhouetted
  by the bright perimeter lights. Whatever it is, it’s strong
  and unrelenting. One Guardian takes a hit --

  More chaos, and snarls outside the gates. Punches thrown,
  teeth bared, blood and spittle flying. Another Guardian gets
  LAUNCHED from the scrum, flying twenty feet back.

  INSIDE - Alberta gets an alert on her earpiece. A tilt of the
  head sends Mikhail and two Guardians out. Moving quickly but
  stealthily so as not to grab attention. As the party goes on…
VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21)                     11.


  OUTSIDE - Mikhail and the two Guardians arrive at the gates
  to find a Guardian dogpile atop their unidentified assailant.
  HISSES and SCREECHES from below as they try to restrain it.

  One of the Guardians raises his stake, but a GNARLY HAND
  whips out from the scrum and grabs the Guardian’s wrist,
  BREAKING IT with a snap. As the Guardian falls back, Mikhail
  is there, driving his stake into the center of the scrum. A
  hideous SHRIEK and then, finally, blissful silence.

  INSIDE - Mikhail and the Guardians calmly return to the
  party, none of the privileged Royals aware of any danger.

  That’s how it works. The Guardians protect the Moroi vampires
  from random Strigoi vampire attacks. It’s the way it has
  always been (but not the way it will always be).

  As camera lingers on the spirited Rose and Lissa dancing
  without a care in the world... CUT TO:

  EXT. LONG COUNTRY ROAD/INT. SUV - NIGHT

  A LIMO flies down the road. Inside, Lissa and Rose are
  ribbing Andre as the parents try to keep the peace.

                      LISSA
            Darlingest, Delightfulest Andre,
            future king of all the land...

                      ROSE
            Oh to be the Chosen One...

                      ANDRE
            Go ahead. Laugh it up.

                      LISSA’S DAD
            Careful or when he’s king he’ll
            have you thrown in the dungeons.

                      ANDRE
            When I’m king I’ll be getting rid
            of the dungeons. Change is coming.

                      LISSA’S DAD
            Winning the crowd is one thing. The
            only ones who matter are the heads
            of the twelve families. Win them
            over, and you’ll be able to make
            real change as king.

  Rose calls up to the Guardian in the front seat.

                      ROSE
            Sebastian, you’re going to be the
            King’s Guardian --

  SEBASTIAN, 30, strong, steady, turns around.

                      SEBASTIAN
            Not with the way you’re climbing in
            the rankings.

                      ROSE
            I’ve already got a job lined up
            when school is done, thank you.

  She leans into Lissa, a BFF nudge.

                      SEBASTIAN
            Only Rose Hathaway would pass up
            the top Guardian spot in the world.

                      ROSE
            Who wants to guard a king when I
            can protect my best friend?

                      ANDRE
            That’s Rose settled. At least one
            of you has a plan.

                      LISSA
            Oh, I have a plan. Finish school,
            and then ask the new king, who I
            happen to have an in with, for a
            dispensation so Rose and I can see
            the world. The outside world. And
            every museum in it.

                      ANDRE
                (teasing)
            And who’s going to take care of our
            aging parents?

                      LISSA’S MOM
            Not funny, Andre.

                      LISSA
            I’m going if I have to forge the
            dispensation myself.

                      ANDRE
            I don’t know, Liss. They’re not
            getting any younger.
                (in a fake kingly voice)
            What we want and what we must do
            can be very different things.

  Lissa hits his arm, all in good fun.

                         ANDRE (CONT'D)
            Hey --

  Suddenly THE CAR SHIFTS like a SONIC BOOM has hit. Everyone
  is ROCKED from their seats in SLOW-MOTION. Shock and horror
  as we RAMP SPEED INTO REAL-TIME --

  The limo FLIPS on the road, as though something catapulted it
  into the air. Sparks and screams and fire. CUT TO:

  EXT. LONG COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

  An empty road. An orange light in the far distance. The light
  gets closer and closer, until we realize it’s the burning
  fireball of a limousine skidding upside down along the road.
  It FLIES STRAIGHT TOWARDS CAMERA and we -- SMASH TO TITLES.

  EXT. CEMETERY - DAWN

  Atop an ancient parapet with a view to the sea, a RAGGED
  WARRIOR ANGEL CARVED FROM STONE stands sentinel over a
  cloistered cemetery. Below we find THREE NAMES FRESHLY ETCHED
  IN ONYX. ERIC DRAGOMIR. RHEA DRAGOMIR. ANDRE DRAGOMIR.

  Lissa lays three calla lilies to honor her family. Behind
  her, family friend and tacit uncle, Victor Dashkov, waits.
  The weight of her grief shows through as he shepherds her
  toward the entrance and a waiting limo --

  EXT. ST. VLADIMIR’S ACADEMY - DUSK

  Perched on a turret, Rose watches as that same limo travels
  the hillside up from the gates.

  Tucking something in her jacket, she checks no one’s watching
  -- then PARKOURS TO A LOWER TURRET, THEN ANOTHER, all speed,
  grace, and supernatural athleticism.

  EXT. ST. VLADIMIR’S ACADEMY - DUSK

  The car pulls to a stop in front of the entrance to St.
  Vladimir’s Academy, sprawling grounds lit by bright lights.

  Rose lands unseen nearby. As a door opens, she rushes up --

                         ROSE
            Lissa...

  -- and suddenly finds   herself FLAT ON HER BACK, a muscled arm
  pinning her down. Her   eyes lock on her assailant’s. Intense,
  focused, belonging to   a very handsome face. She stares at
  him, wind knocked out   of her in more ways than one.

  This is DIMITRI, 25, no-nonsense and stoic. At least on the
  outside. Inside are wells of emotion always kept in check.

  Victor emerges from the car, opening an umbrella to block the
  setting sun.

                      VICTOR
            It’s all right. Rose won’t harm
            Lissa.

                      DIMITRI
            She has something.
                (to Rose)
            Show me.

  Rose pulls a small carved wooden unicorn from her jacket.
  Flustered and a little pissed.

                      ROSE
            It’s a super-dangerous welcome home
            gift.

  Still holding her, Dimitri looks to the gift, then to Rose --
  a tiny chemical beat passing between them, before --

                         LISSA (O.C.)
            I love it.

  Rose turns her head to see Lissa, standing underneath her own
  parasol. She smiles --

                      LISSA (CONT'D)
            I mean, I’m not twelve... but...

                      ROSE
                (beaming)
            Shut up. It’s fucking adorable.

  Rose scrambles to her feet. The girls barrel into each other.
  They hug, laugh, swing each other around.

  As they settle, Rose takes Lissa’s face in her hands. Asks
  with her eyes, you okay? Lissa’s eyes glint with tears: No,
  but I’m trying.

  Dimitri watches the girls, observing the powerful intimacy of
  their friendship. Rose gives Lissa a final nod, like a
  promise to always be there, then takes charge.

                      ROSE (CONT'D)
            Nice to see you, Victor. I’m taking
            Lissa back to the dorm.

  Dimitri starts to follow, but Victor holds him back --

                      VICTOR
            They’re within the wards. They’ll
            be fine.

  As Rose escorts Lissa away --

                      ROSE
            Who is that guy?

                      LISSA
                (don’t kill the messenger)
            That is Dimitri... My new Guardian.

  As Rose looks back, her stare boring a hole through his
  skull, their eyes locking again from afar...

                      ROSE (PRELAP)
            But I’m your Guardian.

  EXT. ST. VLADIMIR’S CAMPUS - NIGHT

  Rose and Lissa cross the brightly lit campus drawing glances,
  hellos, and furtive whispers from students in posh uniforms.
  But all Rose can focus on is --

                      ROSE
            Or I will be when I graduate.

                      LISSA
            Shouldn’t you be heading to class?

                      ROSE
            They kept us apart for three
            months. Class can wait. And don’t
            deflect. We don’t need that guy.
            I’ve got your back. Always.

                      LISSA
            I guess they want someone with
            field experience now that I’m the
            Head of the Dragomir Family.
            Whatever that means. Family of one.

  This is heartbreaking, but Rose knows how to handle it.

                      ROSE
            No. Don’t get sad yet. I have a
            whole thing planned involving a lot
            of booze and sloppy drunk tears.
            We’re not gonna let Dimitri ruin it
            or our plans for the future.

                       LISSA
                (alright then)
            Sloppy drunk sounds good. After a
            nap...
                (also)
            He is good looking, though.

                      ROSE
                (stubborn)
            I didn’t notice.

  As they move towards the building that contains the dorms...

                      DIMITRI (PRELAP)
            Will Rose Hathaway be a problem?

  INT. ALBERTA’S OFFICE - GUARDIAN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

  Dimitri is with Victor and Alberta.

                      ALBERTA
            Rose is always a problem. She’s one
            of our best Novices, but she’s a
            handful.

                      VICTOR
            The girls have been friends their
            whole lives. We’ve spoiled them,
            let them break all the rules, even
            let them be roommates in the Royal
            Dorms. Is it any surprise Rose has
            certain expectations?

                      ALBERTA
            A Guardian’s duty is to do as
            they’re told.

                      VICTOR
            That may be, but this is a big
            change for both of them. As the new
            Head of Family, Lissa is an
            important Royal. With her parents
            and brother gone, she’ll need Rose
            more than ever. For her sake,
            you’ll have to navigate that
            relationship carefully. The last
            thing Lissa needs is more stress.

                      DIMITRI
            With all due respect, I’m not a
            nanny. My job is protection.

                      VICTOR
            A word that can take many forms.

  As Dimitri takes this in...

  INT. GIRLS’ DORM ROOM - NIGHT

  Finally “home” in their room, as Lissa adds Rose’s gift to a
  bevvy of carved unicorns on her dresser. Referring to each:

                      LISSA
            From when I broke my collarbone,
            when I broke up with Antonia Diaz,
            my first hangover. And now...

                      ROSE
                (holding up a black dress)
            ...Should we burn this?

                      LISSA
            Please. I never want to wear black
            again.

                      ROSE
            I wish I’d been with you.

                      LISSA
            I tried. Victor said your place was
            at school, in training. That Royal
            mourning was for family only.

  Rose winces. Weren’t they her family too?

                      ROSE
            Victor, who isn’t a blood relation
            either?

                      LISSA
            He was my parent’s best friend; and
            as my godfather, he’s the boss.
                (then, a smile)
            But not for long.

                      ROSE
                (grinning)
            Not for long. First, graduation.
            Then, every piece of art for you --
            and pizza for me -- in Europe --

                      LISSA
            -- and then the world.

  Rose finds a pouch jammed with prescription medicines.

                      ROSE
            Um... Not sure these will pass
            through human customs...

            ...Unlike you, I didn’t make it out
            of the accident totally unscathed.

  At the mention of the accident, Rose grows quiet. Then --

                      ROSE
                (re the pills)
            No wonder it was so hard to get you
            on the phone.

                      LISSA
            ...I hated taking them... The only
            thing worse was not taking them.

                        ROSE
            Oh, Liss.

                       LISSA
            They said I was all bruised up and
            my arm was broken. But I couldn’t
            feel my body. All I could feel was
            my insides shaking. Like I was
            trapped inside with all this
            feeling and nowhere to go to get
            away from it. So they started
            giving me drugs.
                (then)
            But there isn’t a pill in the world
            strong enough to make it better.

                       ROSE
                (soft)
            I wish I could.

                      LISSA
            I know. Just being with you helps.

                      ROSE
            Good.
                (considering the meds)
            Though maybe my plan will involve
            less booze than expected.

                      LISSA
            It’s okay. I’m tapering off. And I
            don’t wanna blow my surprise party.

                      ROSE
            What surprise party?

                      LISSA

            And I have a date with an old

                      ROSE
            Easy. You can’t wear third degree

  As they round the bend -- SURPRISE! Lissa feigns surprise as
  she surveys the Moroi in their sunglasses and stylish clothes
  taking shade under the gazebo. Meanwhile, Novices bask in the
  sunlight they get so little of living by the Moroi schedule -
  - one in which school and social time are at night, while
  sleep and illicit activities happen during the day.

  MASON, a fun hunky Novice, who everyone knows has a huge
  thing for Rose, approaches with drinks.

                      MASON
            Lissa -- Rose isn’t the only one
            who missed you.

                      ROSE
            Mason helped me plan this.

                      LISSA
            Meaning Rose told you what she
            wanted and you did all the work?

                      ROSE
            No fair. I helped.

                      MASON
            Whatever you say, Rose.

  Lissa spots Mia all in black. Seeing --

                      ROSE
            Mia’s really working it.

                      LISSA
            I feel sorry for her.

                      MASON
            I don’t. She just wants attention.

                      ROSE
            And we didn’t throw you a party to
            talk about Mia. Drink up.

  JUMP CUT: Party hijinks, St. Vlad’s style. Novices show off

  air, courtesy of Moroi Water Users.

  At a makeshift bar, MEREDITH, 18, a matter-of-fact Novice,
  whips up cocktails, her nerd-brain excited by the various
  combinations.

  Rose dirty dances with Mason. On a nearby lounge, JESSE,
  Royal Moroi, 18, makes out with a ROYAL GIRL, while two ROYAL
  BOYS make out with each other.

  Tipsy now, Lissa’s surrounded by friends, enjoying herself.
  REVERSING we see Mia watching her as she orders a drink.

                      MIA
            Vodka tonic.

                      MEREDITH
            Wouldn’t you like something more --

                      MIA
                (a cold glance)
            Extra lime.

                      MEREDITH
            Last thing you need is more acid.

  Meredith mixes as Mia frowns. What’s that supposed to mean?

                      MEREDITH (CONT'D)
            Aren’t you hot in all that?

                      MIA
            I’m in mourning.

                      MEREDITH
            Right. Andre. Your...almost fiancé.

                      MIA
            Excuse me, we were very close.

                      MEREDITH
                (hands her a drink)
            Sorry for your loss.

                      MIA
            This isn’t what I ordered.

  Meredith levels her with a look.

                      MEREDITH
            Maybe not. But it’s what you want.

  Yep, that’s chemistry between them. It unsettles Mia.

                      MIA
            What do you know about what I want?
            How dare you talk to me like that.
                (...takes a sip)
            What’s in this?

                      MEREDITH
            Basil. It’s complex and fragrant.

                      MIA
            Well, it’s a ridiculous thing to
            put in a drink...

                      MEREDITH
            You want another?

                       MIA
            Yes.

  Rose and Lissa approach the bar, seeing too late that Mia is
  there. Rose turns to walk away to avoid her, but Lissa is
  kind and a little bit drunk. Steps forward.

                      LISSA
            How are you, Mia?

                      MIA
            I’m grieving, Lissa.
                (pointed)
            With dignity.

  Rose hears this and spins back, but Lissa can handle herself.

                      LISSA
            Rose... Have a drink. And one for
            me -- Meredith?

                      MIA
            I wouldn’t if I were you. I hear
            you have a big day tomorrow.

                      LISSA
            I’ve taken more than one exam with
            a hangover. I think I can manage an
            early morning at the Royal Court
            with your dad.

                      MIA
            Head of a Family isn’t something
            you can fake your way through.
            Looks like no more dancing through
            life and being best friends with
            Guardians...

                      ROSE
            Looks like more Royal advice from
            Non-Royal Mia...

  Still, they know she’s right. The old days of being together
  doing whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted it, are in
  jeopardy. As the girls consider their fate -- CUT TO BLACK.

  EXT. ST. VLADIMIR'S ACADEMY - DUSK

  It’s magic hour on the quiet campus. Whereas humans would be
  settling down for dinner, vampires are rising for breakfast.

  Lights come on one by one, illuminating the falling shadows.

  INT. CHURCH ARCHIVES – NIGHT (DAY 2)

  Seated at a desk in a candlelit vaulted room of brick and
  stone, a fuzzy headed Lissa tries to focus as Sonya sets an
  ANCIENT PARCHMENT in front of her. As she stares at the
  indecipherable script (WRITTEN IN “OLD MOROI”), to Victor --

                      LISSA
            It might help if we flicked on an
            actual light.

                      SONYA
            That would damage the paper.

                      LISSA
            Oh. Of course.
                (looking down at it)
            Not sure it would help anyway...

                      VICTOR
            You only need to recite this small
            passage.

                         LISSA
            Recite...?

                      VICTOR
            For the consecration. Tradition
            dictates when there’s a new Head of
            the Family they be blessed in the
            presence of all the others.

                      LISSA

                      VICTOR
            I need to see the High Priestess.
            You’ll be fine.

  Victor leaves. Sonya follows, then looks back at Lissa,
  curious. When Lissa looks up, Sonya smiles.

                      SONYA
            That’s a beautiful yellow you’re
            wearing.

  Lissa looks down at her black and white school uniform.

                      LISSA
            Okaaay. See ya, Sonya.

  Lissa looks at the paper, tries to sound it out. Rising, she
  paces, mumbles, squints at the odd writing. Then, suddenly --

  ALL THE CANDLES FLICKER OUT. Lissa looks around, creeped
  out... After a beat -- THEY FLICKER BACK ON...

  Lissa freezes. Then -- A WARM FLAME OF LIGHT APPEARS OVER HER
  PARCHMENT making it far easier to see. Suspecting a prank --

                      LISSA (CONT'D)
            All right. Who’s there?

                      MALE VOICE
            Thought you could use some light.

  Emerging from an alcove is CHRISTIAN OZERA. Smoldering,
  brilliant, wounded, and a new student at St. Vlad's. The two
  hold their gaze for a beat, an instant chemistry between
  them. But there’s something more, something they can’t
  pinpoint. Realizing she’s staring, Lissa raises her chin --

                      LISSA
            And you are?

                       CHRISTIAN
            New.

  She waits for more. Then, wondering if this next admission
  will drive her away -- he almost dares her with it --

                      CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
            I’m Christian Ozera.

                       LISSA
            ...Oh...

  Armoring up, he adds with snark --

                      CHRISTIAN
            And just to get it out of the way:
            No, I don’t know why my parents
            decided to turn Strigoi. And since
            they’re dead I can’t ask them.

  Not sure how to take this, Lissa bites back --

                      LISSA
            So you, what, just hang around
            church archives waiting for girls
            to... need a light?

                      CHRISTIAN
            Or I might have some questions
            about where you go after you die.

  And click. That’s it. The connection - loss. Both orphans.

                      LISSA
            ...I’m sorry about your parents.

                      CHRISTIAN
                (armor coming down)
            I’m sorry about yours.

  A beat as they look at the only other person with any idea of
  how they feel. Then, a bit desperate --

                      LISSA
            So, you actually read this stuff?

                      CHRISTIAN
            I’ve gotten better at it. It’s
            really... kind of... beautiful.

                      LISSA
            I don’t suppose you have any idea
            what this third line means?

  He comes closer to see the parchment.

                      CHRISTIAN
            It’s a vow of protection. The head
            of each family takes an oath to
            fight against demons.

                       LISSA
                (fuck)
            Wonderful...

  Moving closer, he reaches for it. Reads in English —

                       CHRISTIAN
            With my body and my life I swear to
            defend against all demons living
            and dead, and any who would stray
            from what is right.

            Say it with me.

  Both holding it now, their hands touching, they read off the
  paper together in the Old Moroi language, intensely aware of
  each other as they do. He turns to her; they’re so close.

                        CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
              Where’s the rest of it?

                        LISSA
                  (breath catching)
              ...There’s more?

  Then -- footsteps. Lissa turns to see Victor arriving.

                        VICTOR
              Ready?

                        LISSA
              ...I wouldn’t be, except...

  She turns back to Christian but he’s gone. Off Victor’s look:

                        LISSA (CONT'D)
              ...Except, I didn’t want to
              disappoint you.

  As she follows him out --

  INT. PALACE CATHEDRAL – NIGHT

  SACRED   MOROI MUSIC fills the cathedral as a PROCESSION OF
  TWELVE   ROYAL MOROI dressed in matching ceremonial robes move
  toward   the altar. Among them, and the youngest by far, is
  Lissa,   feeling very small.

  The cathedral is full of Royal spectators -- including
  students in head to toe St. Vladimir’s Royal uniforms.

  As Victor watches with the Queen, Christian enters, receiving
  dirty looks, especially from Marie. Ignoring them, he takes a
  spot on an aisle. As he lands, THREE ROYAL MOROI in the aisle
  move to another. There is no doubt, Christian is an outcast.

  As the processional reaches the altar, it splits, leaving
  Lissa alone. High Priestess Irena nods. Lissa, nervous,
  recites her oath in Old Moroi.

                        LISSA
              With my body and my life I swear to

  She looks out and spots a judgmental Marie Conta. Then --
  Christian in the back. Oddly comforted, she continues —

  The Queen watches as Lissa and Christian share a smile.
  Watching as Lissa’s warmth melts Christian’s armor.

  EXT. ST. VLADIMIR'S ACADEMY - TRAINING FIELD - NIGHT

  Rose exits the dorms. Stops when she sees Dimitri standing
  outside, eyes straight ahead in Guardian-mode. Confused --

                      ROSE
            You know we have magic wards around
            the gates to keep us safe. Lissa
            doesn’t need a 24/7 detail.

                      DIMITRI
                (without looking her way)
            Lissa’s still at the church. Royals
            only.

                      ROSE
            So you’re just...having a staring
            contest with the air?

                      DIMITRI
            You’ve studied perimeter control.

                      ROSE
            Yes. Got an A.

                      DIMITRI
            What’s around this perimeter? Don’t
            look, just tell me.

            I’ve trained for years to know
            every inch of this place.

                      DIMITRI
            Exactly. You’re able to operate on
            instinct because you are intimately
            familiar with your surroundings.
            But I’m new here. A lot to learn in

            So I suppose you can say I’m having
            a staring contest with the street,
            the gates, the rooftops and the

  He still hasn’t looked her way. She studies him. Then grins.

                      ROSE
            You’re kind of a Guardian nerd,
            aren’t you?

  At this, he nearly cracks a smile. She starts walking away.
  Toying with him a little.

                      ROSE (CONT'D)
            It’s cool. Respect. Do your thing,
            Perimeter-man. But just know, I
            plan on getting your job when I
            graduate.

                      DIMITRI
            I agree. Lissa would be in
            perfectly good hands with the best
            Guardian at St. Vladimir’s Academy.

                         ROSE
            Thank you.

                      DIMITRI
            Although that may be hard, given
            your ranking.

                      ROSE
            I’m number one. I’m always number
            one.

                      DIMITRI
            Then perhaps you’re not as good at
            Perimeter Control as you think.

  Rose looks at him, confused. His gaze shifts to something
  behind her. She turns, following his gaze to see --

  The LEADERBOARD above the training field. Rose Hathaway is
  listed in FIFTH PLACE. Mason in first.

                      ROSE

            I missed class to welcome Lissa
            back to school.

                      ALBERTA
            Find me a Strigoi who will accept
            that excuse and we’ll talk.

  A nod of her head tells Rose to fall in line with the group.
  Frustrated, Rose does. Mason throws her a sexy grin.

            Game on, Hathaway.

                      ROSE
            Don’t get comfortable, Mace.

  Rose goes through the warm-ups. Her body is fierce and fluid,
  but her mind is racing. Across the yard, she spots Dimitri
  back in position. She doesn’t notice, but his eyes flick to
  watch her for just a moment. She has made an impression.

  INT. GIRLS' DORM ROOM - DUSK

  Back to bedtime. The girls prepare for bed, a lot on their
  minds. Lissa notices Rose is uncharacteristically silent.

  Lissa sits on the floor, legs crossed. Rose lies down, her
  head in Lissa’s lap. She stares up at her, unleashing --

            bring me down, and I’ve had Mia’s
            stupid voice in my head all day,
            and Dimitri’s a dick. And now that
            he’s assigned to you, I’m afraid
            they’ll never let me be your
            Guardian out in the world after
            graduation. Anyway, I pretty much
            hate everyone. Except you... What?

                (smiling)
            Your well-intentioned outrage is my
            favorite thing about you.

                      ROSE
            Good, because I’m pretty sure
            you’re stuck with it forever.

                      LISSA
            Okay. A. Don’t worry about Dimitri.
            And B. Do not listen to Mia. We
            know who we are. And where we’re
            going. Pretty soon our biggest
            problem will be finding Feeders for
            me and Italian food for you.

                      ROSE
            Preferably in Italy... And how was
            your day?

                      LISSA
            Well, I had to speak Ancient Moroi
            in front of a hundred Royals.

                       ROSE
            Oof.

                      LISSA
            And Victor said from now on I have
            to be up, dressed and pretty by
            7pm. Oh, and I’m not allowed to
            drink anymore.

                      ROSE
            Jesus. You win. Switch.

  They switch positions and now Lissa’s head is in Rose’s lap.

                      ROSE (CONT'D)
            Maybe that’s not the worst thing,
            though, with all those meds you’re
            taking.

                      LISSA
            No. I’m totally off those now.

            It’s fine. I’m tired of living in a
            fog.

  Rose looks down at her. Gently --

                      ROSE
            What do you see now that the fog is
            lifting?

                      LISSA
            ...I miss them.

  Rose nods. They sit in silence feeling the weight of this.
  Lissa closes her eyes, letting her exhaustion wash over her.
  Rose sits silently while her friend falls asleep.

  EXT. ACADEMY/EXT. VICTOR’S HOUSE – DAY

  The campus is deserted as Moroi ready for bed. Except for
  Sonya, who is surrounded by several birds, seeming happier
  amongst animals than humans. As she hums and feeds them, one
  flies off toward Victor’s house where —

  INT. MIA’S BEDROOM – DAY

  VICTOR enters to find Mia in her PJ’s looking out a window.

                      VICTOR
            Anything interesting out there?

                      MIA
            Just Sonya, the bird lady.

                      VICTOR
            Be gentle on your sister.

                      MIA
            I am. Sometimes. But really...

  He glances at a JEWELED NECKLACE on Mia’s vanity.

                      VICTOR
            You need to give that to Lissa.

                      MIA
            I do not. And anyway, I’m wearing
            it to the reception tomorrow.

                      VICTOR
            ...I’m sorry, Mia. It’s Royals
            only. The Queen was very insistent.
VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21)          33.


                      MIA
            So that’s it? One minute I’m the
            future king’s fiancée and the next
            I’m invisible? I’m keeping the
            necklace.

                      VICTOR
            It’s a Dragomir family heirloom.

                      MIA
            And a Dragomir gave it to me.

                      VICTOR
                (gently)
            With Andre dead, you can’t keep it.

                      MIA
            I was so close. I know everyone
            thinks it was just an arranged
            marriage, that you wheedled a favor
            from the Queen. But she adored
            Andre. She only allowed it because
            he asked her. He thought I was
            smart. He may not have loved me; I
            didn’t love him. That way. But we
            were good together... I would have
            made a great queen.

                      VICTOR
            There’s a lot you can do without
            ever sitting on a throne.

                      MIA
            You’re Royal. You don’t get it. The
            only way to wield power is to have
            power. Thanks to being adopted,
            Sonya and I live with the trappings
            of royalty, but the restrictions of
            not being Royal.

                      VICTOR
            Having the ear of the Queen can be
            just as powerful...and the Queen
            has big plans for Lissa.

  Mia turns back to the window.

                      MIA
            Lissa is a twit... And what is up
            with Sonya and those fucking birds?

  EXT. VICTOR’S HOUSE - GROUNDS - DAY

  We go back to Sonya as she watches a bird soar overhead.
  Suddenly it’s joined by another...then another. The sky
  shifts, the world becoming stylized. The day darkens.

  More birds gather into a murmuration of starlings, and now
  instead of Sonya down below, we find Rose staring up at the
  sky in fascination. The mood is gothic, ethereal (if it feels
  like a dream sequence, that’s because it is).

  The birds move and shift, flying lower to the ground. Rose is
  startled by this. They take the shape of a MAN. The Bird Man
  starts moving towards Rose. As it gets closer, the birds
  disperse, revealing an ACTUAL man in their place. It’s ANDRE.
  Bloody. Skin torn, teeth smashed. Horrifically injured.

                      ROSE

  INT. GIRLS' DORM ROOM - DAY

  Rose BOLTS up in her bed, covered in sweat, breathing
  heavily. She looks around to get her bearings, seeing --

  Lissa is in bed, thrashing around in the midst of a terrible
  night terror. Rose scrambles over to Lissa’s bed, shaking
  Lissa awake. Lissa looks at her, wild-eyed, but then --

                        LISSA
            Rose.

                      ROSE
            Shhhh. You’re having a bad dream.

  Lissa nods, her eyes drooping again. As she drifts off --

                      LISSA
            All those birds...

  Rose’s head snaps in her direction. Did she and Lissa just
  have the same dream? CUT TO BLACK.

  INT. ROYAL FEEDING CHAMBER – NIGHT

  CLOSE ON THE   FACE OF A   HUMAN WOMAN, eyes wide as a pair of
  fangs search   her neck.   She begins to pant. Is that fear? No,
  it’s desire.   She grips   her right hand with her left to keep
  from pulling   whoever’s   attached to those fangs in.

  Finally the fangs pop the surface of her skin and sink slowly
  in. A gasp of pleasure escapes her lips. REVEAL Jesse seated
  behind her, feeding from her neck.

  He’s among a row of RECLINERS in a spa-like setting, where a
  dozen ATTRACTIVE HUMANS, all high from the bite, lie in
  various states of repose as Royals enjoy their ‘breakfast.’

  Lissa enters. Looking for the COORDINATOR, she sees him
  watching Jesse, who’s going to town on his Feeder’s neck. As
  the Feeder’s eyes roll back into her head from blood loss --

                      COORDINATOR
            Mr. Zeklos. This is your second
            warning. We have rules. This is a
            human Feeder, to be respected.

  The picture of smug Royal privilege, Jesse wipes his mouth --

                      JESSE
            And you’re a Non-Royal nobody. So
            piss off.

                      LISSA
            Leave him alone, Jesse.

  Covering his annoyance, Jesse takes his leave. As he goes,
  the Coordinator waves Lissa toward one of the Feeders. An
  older woman, ALICE, 50s, with a perma-stoner grin.

                      LISSA (CONT'D)
            Hey, Alice. Haven’t seen you in a
            while.

                      ALICE
            I’ve been working in the Non-Royal
            feeding chamber. I think I aged
            out. But one of the skinny hot
            Feeders fainted and here I am.

            to say about life out in the human
            side of things?

                      ALICE
            Well, according to my daughter,
            it’s a cesspool of poverty, racism,
            and don’t even get her started on
            carbon emissions. Which is why your
            neck of the woods is so much more
            appealing to an old lady like me.
            No pun intended.

  As they chat, Lissa sits behind her, getting comfortable.

            It’s only a matter of time before

            for ourselves.

            Don’t know why you’d bother. Except
            Shake Shack. You vamps eat, right?

                      LISSA
            Sometimes. You ready?

  Alice nods. Lissa arches her neck and delicate FANGS appear.
  As she gently bites into Alice, who falls into bliss --

            Oh that’s nice...

  ANGLE ON THE DOOR, where Mia enters (still in black). Her
  eyes scan the room, finding Lissa. She heads over.

  Lissa releases Alice’s neck and raises her head to find the
  Dragomir necklace dangling from Mia’s outstretched hand.

            I guess this is yours now.

            for you to mourn him this way.

            Thank you.

            Oh, I’m sorry -- I didn’t realize --

  At that, the Coordinator approaches Mia.

            Do you see me feeding?

            She’s with me.

                      COORDINATOR
            I’m afraid it doesn’t matter,
            Princess. That’s the rule.

  Mia darkens. She hates this. Lissa feels terrible.

                      LISSA
            Well, then we’ll both go.

  As they exit, Mia steals a look at Lissa, remembering her
  father’s words about power.

            everyone else look like garbage.

  They head through the door... MUSIC UP:

  EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS – NIGHT

  CLOSE ON THE LEADERBOARD. Rose’s fifth place ranking mocking
  her from above. She heads for the field stopping when she
  sees Dimitri standing with Alberta.

  He gives her a polite nod. She nods back somewhat less
  politely then makes a beeline for Mason. Alberta to Dimitri --

  A look flashes between them that doubles down on their
  subtext. There’s some history there. CUT TO:

  Mikhail whistles the start of the Challenge Match. Rose and
  Mason start to spar. They dip and move like elegant boxers,
  no one throwing the first punch. Mason grins at her.

                      MASON (CONT'D)
            C’mon. Make it hurt --

  BAM. Rose lands a brutal punch -- and they’re all in.

  INT. GIRLS' DORM ROOM - NIGHT

  Mia helps Lissa get ready. Piles and piles of dresses cover
  both beds. Mia is good at this. She pulls pieces together,
  using them unconventionally to build a stunning outfit. As
  she places the Dragomir necklace around Lissa’s neck...

  EXT. TRAINING FIELD – NIGHT

  Challenge Night continues, as Rose and Mason spar, the other
  Novices split in their allegiance, cheering on from the side.

  The fighting is a blend of primal hand-to-hand contact with
  elements of Martial Arts. Guardians punch harder, run faster
  and jump higher than ordinary humans.

  From the sidelines, Dimitri watches Rose in action. His face
  doesn’t react, but inside he’s impressed.

  At the BUZZER, Rose and Mason stop, panting. Finally, Alberta
  raises a WHITE CARD. Mason lets out a whoop.

  INT. PALACE - NIGHT

  Mid-conversation with a FUSSY ROYAL at the Queen’s private
  cocktail party, Lissa eyes champagne floating by on a tray...

                      LISSA
            I had no idea there was so much to
            know about tea...

                      FUSSY ROYAL
            I’ve made quite a study of it. King
            Abdullah never drank anything but
            in his era. Except a little
            rosewater now and again.

  AT THE ENTRANCE, Christian approaches in a bespoke suit,
  looking very Royal. Recognizing him, the DOORMAN hesitates --

                      DOORMAN
            I’m not sure you should be here.

  Christian’s eyes flash GOLD (a mark of a true Royal):

                      CHRISTIAN
            I’m still an Ozera and my bloodline
            still has a vote. You can’t keep me
            out.

  No choice, the Doorman lets him in. Ignoring the disapproving
  glances, Christian peers around. Finally, he sees Lissa.

  As though sensing she turns and sees Christian, their gaze
  holding until someone cuts across the room, breaking it. They
  circle through the crowd toward each other. Finally meeting,
  neither quite knows what to say...

  Nearby Victor spots them. Not happy, he excuses himself from
  his conversation. As he makes his way over –

            Mason’s size but she’s using it as
            an advantage.

                      ALBERTA

            The Queen is looking for you.

  With a curt nod to Christian, as Victor leads Lissa away —

  AT THE FIELD deep into the fight, Rose struggles to reach
  Mason’s heart. Then DING. Mason has hit hers.

  Frustrated, Rose eyes Mason as they spar. DING. He hit it
  again. But this time Rose clocked how. DING. She gets a hit
  in. As they continue —

  AT THE EVENT, as Lissa looks back to Christian --

                      VICTOR (CONT'D)
            Christian Ozera is a non-starter.
            His parents chose to turn Strigoi.
            That is a mortal sin. The last
            thing you need is the church
            against you.

                      LISSA
            Why does anyone care who I like?
            Can’t I be left alone to live my
            life the way I want to?

  Victor laughs ruefully, then gently:

                      VICTOR
            Oh, Lissa. That is the opposite of
            what your life will be.
                (switching gears)
            We need to discuss your schedule.
            With so many families in town for
            St. Vladimir’s Day, and your
            installation as the leader of the
            Dragomir’s, there will be several
            privy Council meetings. Attendance
            is mandatory. Also...

  As Victor carries on, Lissa sees Christian, who, aware of
  disapproving eyes on him, quietly slips away.

                      VICTOR (CONT'D)
            ...The other Heads of Families will
            be inviting you to a series of less
            formal events, also mandatory.
            Starting tomorrow --

                       LISSA
            No.

  Victor looks up. Lissa’s face flushes, anxiety creeping in.

                      LISSA (CONT'D)
            I don’t want this. I’m not Andre. I
            don’t want any of this.

  Lissa’s breath catches as she --

  FLASHES BACK TO THE NIGHT OF THE ACCIDENT, seeing Andre --
  only this time as he speaks --

                      ANDRE
            What we want and what we must do
            can be very different things...

  -- THE CAR SHIFTS like a SONIC BOOM has hit, his dialogue
  bottoming out as we see him in SLOW-MOTION be sprayed with
  flying glass. As blood begins pouring down his face -- --

  BACK TO Lissa as she starts to hyperventilate.

  AT THE FIELD, Rose goes in for Mason’s heart –-

  -- As Lissa’s panic rises, her vision starts to blur. Dizzy
  now, as she reaches out to keep herself from falling --

  -- Rose, about to successfully complete the move – falters.

  Lissa starts to sink into a faint, Victor props her up as --

  Rose’s knees give, almost as though she is fainting too.

  DING. Mason gets the hit. Alberta gives Dimitri a ‘told you
  so’ look. As Rose wonders what the fuck just happened, she
  faints and we...CUT TO BLACK.

  INT. GIRLS’ DORM ROOM – DAY

  Rose enters, slinging her gym bag down, losing her hoodie --

                      ROSE
            Sorry to wake you. I was in the
            infirmary. This really weird thing
            happened where --

  Rose looks at Lissa’s bed. Sees the covers are mussed, but
  Lissa is gone. CUT TO:

  INT. DORM ROOFTOP - DAY

  Lissa stands in the sun staring at the sky. She’s still, even
  peaceful as an angry rash starts to rise on her skin. Then --

            Lissa... What are you doing?

  Lissa turns to Rose. Tears standing in her eyes --

                      LISSA
            I don’t know why I’m here. Andre
            was the special one. He should have
            lived, not me.

                      ROSE
            Oh, Liss. That’s not true. It’s
            just the grief talking. You’ve been
            through so much.

                      LISSA
            But it’s all a blur. I feel like
            they were here, we were all here,
            together. And then there was an
            accident I can’t even remember --
            and then they were gone... and I...

  Rose pulls Lissa into a protective hug. As she cries it out:

                      ROSE
            I know... I know.
                (after a beat)
            ...You really don’t remember
            anything about that night?

                      LISSA
            No. It’s all one big brain fog that
            won’t clear.

                      ROSE
            Mine’s more like a complete blank.

  Is that weird? Time will tell. As Lissa settles --

                      ROSE (CONT'D)
            There you go. Just blow your nose.
            Oh, okay. On my shirt’s fine.

  Then, suddenly knowing what Lissa needs, what they both need -

                      ROSE (CONT'D)
            But Lissa? If we’re gonna sunbathe,
            I know where I want to be.

  EXT. LAKE – DAY

  Rose pedals a well-worn bike with Lissa on the seat behind
  her under her parasol, both girls giddy with freedom.

  As they arrive at the edge of a lake on the outskirts of
  campus, past the gates, Lissa lights up. Rose smiles --

                      ROSE
            This is the first place your family
            took me.

                      LISSA
            I remember. Right after I met you.
            Standing all alone on Family Day.

                      ROSE
            You ran straight up to me. Your
            clothes were so clean I was afraid
            your parents wouldn’t let you play
            with me.

                      LISSA
            They loved you.

                      ROSE
            I didn’t know what a family was
            until then.

  As that lands on Lissa --

                      LISSA
            You keep asking if I’m going to be
            okay. Are you?

                      ROSE
            They were... everything a family
            should be. You said Andre should be
            here - I feel like Sebastian should
            be too. He was a great Guardian to
            Andre. But he died too. They were
            all so strong... But somehow we’re
            the survivors.

                (beat, trying to deflect)
            I guess that can be our band name.

                      ROSE
            Well, it’s time we have our own
            memorial. Our own chance to say
            goodbye.

  She reaches into the backpack she has with her, and as she
  pulls out TWO COLORFUL SKY LANTERNS we CUT TO:

  Dimitri steals private time to do his physical and meditative
  training on the roof under the sun as the campus sleeps. His
  body is a temple, reflected in his flow.

  He looks out at the campus for a moment, a part of him always
  on duty. Then, as he carries on with this regimen --

  EXT. LAKE – DAY

  Under the shade of the tree, Lissa and Rose hold hands. In
  their free hand they each hold a lantern. Then Lissa, simply:

                      LISSA
            Mom, Dad, Andre. We love you. And
            we’ll never stop missing you. Be at
            peace.

  They release the lanterns. After a beat...

            here?

            ...And I beat you to the pier.

                      ROSE
            Did not. That’s crazy.

                      LISSA
            I totally did. And I still can.

                      ROSE
            You’ve never once beaten me to the -

  But Lissa BOLTS. Diving in the water she races to the Pier.

                      ROSE (CONT'D)
            CHEATER --!

  As Rose dives in after her.

  EXT. ACADEMY ROOFTOP – DAY?

  Something catches Dimitri's peripheral vision. He looks up.
  And sees two lanterns floating in the sky. And something
  tells him to head to —

  INT. GIRLS’ DORM ROOM – DAY

  Dimitri knocks. No answer. He nods to DORM MATRON OKSANA, who
  opens the door. She looks in, then opens the door wide so he
  can see. The room is empty. The girls aren’t in their beds.

  EXT. LAKE – DAY

  The girls lie under a shaded tree, Lissa’s parasol giving her
  extra protection from the sun.

            Thank you for that. I feel better
            than I’ve felt in a while.

                      ROSE
            You’re lucky you didn’t burn your
            face off, but yeah, I know. I can
            kind of feel it coming off of you.
            Is that weird?

                      LISSA
            Not really. You’ve always been
            pretty tuned in to me.

                      ROSE
            Yeah, I guess.
                (broaching carefully)
            Though, since you got back, I’m
            feeling all this stuff, but it
            seems...more like your feelings.
            Like, last night I got this flash
            of panic and I knew you needed me.

                      LISSA
            I was panicking. I did need you.

                      ROSE
            That’s weird. Right?

                       LISSA
            Very.

  As they think about this --

                      LISSA (CONT'D)
            Earlier, when you found me on the
            roof. How did you know I was there?

                      ROSE
            I don’t know. I just... did.

  They look at each other, understanding that this isn’t
  normal. But then a bird FLIES overhead and Rose checks the
  sky, mindful of the time. The sun is getting low.

                      ROSE (CONT'D)
            We should head back. It’s one thing
            to be outside the wards in the sun,
            but if we get caught out here
            during Strigoi hours, we’re fucked.

            Just because I’m not a Guardian --

   The bike hits a rock, tossing both girls to the ground.

            Ow -- shit.

            Are you okay?

                      LISSA
            Something’s bruised. Maybe my ego --

  Rose checks Lissa’s knee, which is torn up from the fall.

                      ROSE
            Can you walk?

                      LISSA
            Yeah. Sorry, Rose.

  Rose helps her to the bike. And sees the wheel is bent. Shit.
  She checks the sky again. Sunset is nigh.

                      ROSE
            Forget about walking. We need to

  EXT. WOODS – NIGHT

  Rose and Lissa race back through the woods. In the growing
  night, every snapping branch underfoot feels frightening.

  They approach a back GATE, split by a STONE WALL. Rose is
  about to climb the wall, when suddenly she stops, sensing
  something. A wave of unease, bordering on nausea.

                      LISSA
            What’s wrong?

                      ROSE
            I don’t know. I feel sick —

  Then -- something DROPS INTO FRAME behind Lissa. It’s
  shadowed and snarling. Rose immediately LUNGES for Lissa --
  grabbing her, using Lissa’s weight to her benefit (like
  earlier with Mason) and HURLS her upwards. As Lissa lands on
  the wall, their Pursuer follows -- hitting the top of the
  wall and INCINERATING in a shocking electric FLASH.

            Rose...

                      ROSE

  Lissa stares at the smoking dead Strigoi just inches from
  her. Ew. She looks down in the nick of time to see --

            ROSE --

  Another Strigoi is BARRELLING towards Rose. Rose turns just a
  beat too late and the Strigoi SLAMS into her, getting her up
  against the wall. The Strigoi and Rose are nose-to-nose and
  for the first time we get a look at it --

  Blazing red eyes. Long jagged fangs. Veins protruding. A
  feral energy. The face of nightmares.

  Rose struggles against it, searching for a weakness to
  exploit, but there is no escape from its grip.

  UP ABOVE, Lissa looks for some way, any way to help.

  Rose’s Strigoi EXTENDS ITS JAW to go in for the kill. Lissa
  SCREAMS, when -- CRACK. The Strigoi FALLS, revealing --

  Dimitri standing behind it. A bloody stake in his hand. Rose
  and Dimitri stare at each other. Both breathing heavily, both
  terrified by what just happened. Rose can see it in his eyes.

  Victor paces before an exhausted Lissa.

                      VICTOR
            That kind of risk was unacceptable
            at any time. Now, the future of the

            A tiny family with no Andre, in a
            society with antiquated rules. What
            does it even matter?

            If you think the rules are
            antiquated now, wait until you see
            what happens if any of the vipers
            jockeying for the crown get their
            way. Andre’s rule meant change for
            us. If the crown falls to the wrong
            bloodline, any progress your
            brother hoped to achieve -- will be
            impossible. The Dragomir vote is
            key to preventing that.

                      LISSA
            Fine. You can tell me how to vote.

                      VICTOR
            I could. And you could carry on
            without a care in the world as the
            empty vessel of leadership everyone
            expects you to be. Is that how your
            parents raised you?

  A long beat as she lets his words sink in.

                       LISSA
            No. But they raised Andre to be
            more.
                (then)
            I’ll stay until the succession is

  Rose exits the administrative wing to find Dimitri standing
  outside in his ‘spot.’ His eyes meet hers. Steely.

            No need. I just got an earful and
            then some from Alberta.

  He doesn’t break her gaze. She stares at him, almost
  challenging him. Then --

            You saved me. Thank you.
                (off his silence)
            I should’ve told you I was taking
            Lissa outside of the wards. And I
            should have built in more time on
            our return for exigencies like the
            bike getting damaged. But I got her
            back in one piece. I made sure she
            was protected. They come first.

  Dimitri finally speaks. Low and even, but hard.

            Protecting Lissa is my job. My only
            role here is to ensure that nothing
            happens to her. What you did was

            strong, but you’re a liability. And
            tonight you almost got the person
            you say you care about most in the
            world killed.

  INT. GUARDIAN BARRACKS – LOUNGE - NIGHT

  Mason and other Novices finish breakfast in the lounge of
  their barracks. More utilitarian than the Moroi dorms,
  furthering the class distinction between the two.

  Rose enters with her duffle bag. As Mason watches, Rose heads
  for one of the rooms, where -

  INT. GUARDIAN BARRACKS – WOMEN’S SLEEP ROOM - NIGHT

  A row of beds and desks. Meredith looks up from making her
  bed as Rose enters.

                      MEREDITH
            Guess you’re slumming it with the
            rest of us now.

  As Rose wordlessly drops her bag onto an empty bed --

  INT. LISSA AND MIA’S DORM ROOM – NIGHT

  Lissa enters her new room and drops the bag she’s carrying.

                       MIA (O.S.)
            I thought we’d be sisters, not
            roommates.

  Lissa turns to find Mia, dressed in Saturday casual, who adds
  to the woman on tap to be the next queen:

                      MIA (CONT'D)
            You can have the window side if you
            like.

  Lissa forces a smile. Then looks out the window and sees
  Christian walking, alone. Aimless. He looks sad. She opens
  her hand, looking down at Rose’s unicorn tucked in her palm.

  INT. GUARDIAN REC ROOM – NIGHT

  Rose is checking email on a computer, staring at the words –
  “let me and yourself down. As a Guardian I was shocked at
  your behavior. As your mother, I’m ashamed...” Then --

                       MASON
            Rose?

  She looks up. He can see that whatever she was reading hurt.

                      ROSE
            How come our mothers, the same
            women who leave us on the doorstep
            of this school as infants so they
            can to go back to being Guardians,
            still get to tell us what to do?

                      MASON
            ...I wanted to see if you’re okay.

                      ROSE
            You didn’t get that many good shots
            in. I’ll live.

                      MASON
            I didn’t mean that.

  Rose rises, and face to face with Mason --

                      ROSE
            Mason, I really only have two uses
            for you right now. And I’m not in
            the mood to spar, so...

  She kisses him. Starts to pull at his shirt. He pulls away.

                      MASON
            Whoa. Whoa. Wait a minute, Rose. I
            can’t believe I’m actually going to
            say this -- but I’m not here for
            that. Now. In this moment. I
            thought we could talk. With
            everything that’s been going on, I
            thought... I could be a friend.
            Just pretend I’m Lissa. Don’t
            laugh. What would she do now?

                      ROSE
            ...You’d sit cross-legged... and
            one of us would put our head in the
            other’s lap and we’d argue over who
            had the worst day -- which
            obviously today I would win.

  Mason sits, crosses his legs. His lap is ready.

                      MASON
            I’ll be the judge of that. Legit,
            this had better be good.

  Rose smiles. Then lies down with her head in his lap.

                      ROSE
            I just wanted to make Lissa feel
            better...

  INT. MOROI DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

  Christian moves down the hall, most others keeping their
  distance. He arrives at his door, where a small wrapped BOX
  sits. He looks around, curious about and wary of its source.

  He opens it. Inside, Lissa’s unicorn, and a note: I wondered
  if you knew how to say unicorn in Old Moroi?

  As he allows himself a touched smile.

  INT. LISSA AND MIA’S DORM ROOM – NIGHT

  Lissa dresses for yet another party. The dress. The pin in
  her hair. She stares in the mirror, hollow. Then, a KNOCK --

  She opens the door to Dimitri holding an ornate wooden box:

                      DIMITIRI
            This was left with the Matron for
            you. I already checked it.

  He hands it to her, politely exiting. She checks it out. It
  has a delicate pearl inlay. She opens it to find a parchment
  scroll. She unrolls it, seeing the Old Moroi passage she was
  working on earlier within a larger reading.

  As she opens the card that came inside the box, we hear --

                      CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
            The passage you read today was an
            oath to slay demons. The rest of
            this passage, the parts that they
            don’t feel the need to teach you,
            says why. You fight for family, for
            justice, and for love. I agree.
            Christian. PS. I think unicorn in
            Moroi? Is Lissa...

  As Lissa stares at these words, lit up...

                      VICTOR (PRELAP)
            We were wrong about Lissa...

  INT. ROYAL COURT PRISON CELLS - NIGHT

  As the red eyes of a BOUND AND BEATEN STRIGOI glare from the
  shadows of its cell, the Queen listens to Victor.
VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21)                    54.


                      VICTOR
            She’s not ready. Not emotionally or
            any other way.

  WHAM! The Strigoi throws itself against the cage door.
  Hissing and baring its fangs. The Queen doesn’t flinch.

                      QUEEN
            Ready is a luxury we don’t have. We
            already live our lives in quiet
            dread, but with the Strigoi getting
            bolder those lunatics on the right
            will legislate the very air we
            breathe in the name of keeping us
            safe... While the pie-eyed dreamers
            on the left whisper about releasing
            the Guardians from their service,
            threatening the very protections
            our species needs to survive...

                      VICTOR
            She doesn’t have a political bone
            in her body.

                      QUEEN
            Exactly. She is untainted, able to
            see the good in all people.
            Everything I was before the vipers
            nest made me cynical and haggard.

                      VICTOR
            You are hardly haggard, If you
            could just hold on a bit longer...

                      QUEEN
            I’m tired, Victor.

  WHAM! The Strigoi hits the cage again. Victor shoots a wary
  look at it. The Queen remains unbothered.

                      QUEEN (CONT'D)
            And I’d like to live out the rest
            of my days in some semblance of
            quiet. I think I’ve earned tha --

  But the Strigoi ATTACKS again, only this time the door RIPS
  OPEN and it heads straight for her.

  The Queen’s GUARDIANS leap in and SLAM the Strigoi to the
  ground. One grabs a BLADE and SLAMS it onto the Strigoi’s
  neck, decapitating it. The Queen stares at its writhing body.

                      QUEEN (CONT'D)
            We’re going to be late for the
            party.

  As she sweeps away...

  INT. PALACE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

  ... We HEAR the CLINKS of GLASSES. As the Queen raises hers:

                      QUEEN
            A toast to you all on St.
            Vladimir’s feast day.
                (to Irena)
            And to the service today. The last
            I’ll witness as your sovereign. It
            is time to name the next.

  The crowd is surprised. Irena and Marie Conta share a look.

                      HIGH PRIESTESS IRENA
            Your Majesty, protocol demands the
            announcement be made in a more
            formal setting.

                      QUEEN
            Protocol can kiss my aging Royal
            buttocks. Protocol may be helpful
            as a tool, but when the knife
            wields the chef, it ceases to be of
            use. I am ready to name my heir.

                      MARIE CONTA
            We’ll still need to vote to approve
            him, Your Majesty. Wouldn’t it be
            prudent to survey the candidates
            with the privy council first to
            ensure a swift and unanimous vote
            of the twelve families to approve?

                      QUEEN
            I think we all know the likelihood
            of a unanimous vote for any of the
            so-called “frontrunners” here.

  “Frontrunner” Marie fights a scowl, as standing next to
  Irena, Tatiana, sips champagne, enjoying the proceedings.

                      QUEEN (CONT'D)
            But there is someone we’ve
            overlooked... Having ruled since I
            was a girl, I know the virtue of
            youth, and of compassion in this
            position. But I am old.

                      QUEEN (CONT'D)
            And dare I say cynical. Still, fear
            not, the future of the monarchy
            will be in good hands.

  At that, the Queen turns to Lissa.

                      QUEEN (CONT'D)
            As the next heir to the throne, I
            name Vasilissa Dragomir.

  Lissa registers confusion, then fear. And as every eye in the
  room lands on her --

  around helpless. As the ballroom erupts into scandalized
  chatter --
