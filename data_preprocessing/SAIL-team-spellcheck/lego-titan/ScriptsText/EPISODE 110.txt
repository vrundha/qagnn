1   EXT. CITY MIDDLE - ESTABLISHING                              1
    A bright sunny day in the city. STUDENTS scamper into the
    building. We hear the SQUELCH of a PA sytem. Then --
1                       COACH JEFFREYS (O.S.)                    1
              It’s been an... interesting Sheep
              Week here at City Middle...

2   INT. CITY MIDDLE - CAFETERIA STAGE - DAY                     2
    STUDENTS and TEACHERS gather around the cafeteria stage.
    Sheep Week regalia covers the walls. COACH JEFFREYS stands on
    stage, mic in hand, ready to hand out trophies that JADYN
    awkwardly prepares on a nearby table.
2                       COACH JEFFREYS                           2
              But the team that defied
              expectation and overcame the odds
              to become this year’s champions...
    Jadyn attempts a drum roll on the table.
3                       COACH JEFFREYS (CONT’D)                  3
              The Nobodies!
    Jadyn knocks over several of the trophies. There is a
    smattering of disinterested applause.
4                       COACH JEFFREYS (CONT’D)                  4
                  (smile fading)
              Nobodies?
    DALLAS’S TEAM, THE WOLVES sullenly looks on as Coach, trophy
    in hand, scans the room. Makes eye contact with MS. PUTNAM
    who shrugs her shoulders. NOVA and several of her Nightmare
    Club cohorts look around, whisper conspiratorially.
5                       COACH JEFFREYS (CONT’D)                  5
                  (growing distraught)
              What kind of team skips out on
              their own award?! How do you know
              you’re champions if you don’t have
              a trophy that says so?!
    Dallas reaches out to touch the 1ST PLACE TROPHY. Coach
    smacks his hand away.

3   INT. MR. OZ’S CLASSROOM - DAY                                3
    MATEO, IZZIE, COOPER and ZOEY gather in front of MR. OZ at
    his desk. He looks up from grading papers, confused.
                                                                 2.

6                        MR. OZ                                       6
               Guys... why aren’t you at the
               assembly?
     Mateo trades an uneasy look with his friends. Looks up
     solemnly to Mr. Oz --
7                        MATEO                                        7
               Because it doesn’t mean anything
               without Logan...
     Oz stops grading. Concern washes over his face...
8                         MR. OZ                                      8
               What do you mean?
                   (beat)
               Mateo, where is Logan?
     Off of Mateo’s worried look --
     TITLE SEQUENCE ROLLS
     Music swells... and we HARD CUT TO --

4    EXT. GRIM REALM - DAY                                            4
     A Craggy, fog-shrouded marshland full of hills and caves,
     barren trees, and hopeless skies. In the distance, the
     ominous SHADOWKEEP looms...
     Oz and the kids emerge from the DREAM BRIDGE DOOR and behold
     the frightening vista.
9                        IZZIE                                        9
               I still don’t get it, how did Logan
               end up here? What was he doing?
10                       MR. OZ                                   10
               I suspect Luna’s Hourglass had
               something to do with it...
11                          MATEO                                 11
               What?!
12                       MR. OZ                                   12
               Someone took it from my office at
               the Night Bureau.
13                       COOPER                                   13
               Dude... what was he thinking...
14                       ZOEY                                     14
               He was probably feeling left out!
               You ever think about that when
               you’re running around dreamcrafting
               all the time?
                                                              3.

15                       MATEO                                    15
               Wait, are you actually defending
               him? He totally stole that
               hourglass and now we gotta get it
               back before--
16                       MR. OZ                                   16
               Okay, okay... Look, right now the
               most important thing is rescuing
               Logan before the Nightmare King
               knows we’re here.
     A piercing SHRIEK prompts everyone to look to the sky as they
     see a NIGHT TERROR patroling on the horizon...
17                       ZOEY                                     17
               Might be too late...
18                       IZZIE                                    18
                   (determined)
               Not if I can help it.
19                       MR. OZ                                   19
               Wait, No! Izzie--
     Izzie whips out her hourglass, begins to dreamcraft... light
     from the swirling sand shining out like a lighthouse in the
     gloomy landscape as --
20                       MR. OZ (CONT’D)                          20
               This place is so devoid of
               happiness and creativity, any
               display of imagination becomes a
               target!
     THE NIGHT TERROR suddenly banks hard, immediately zeroing in
     on Izzie as she crafts Bunzai...
     Uh oh... The kids scramble for cover by a NIGHTMARISH TREE as
     the Night Terror screams inbound!
21                       COOPER                                   21
               Sooo... you’re saying we’re behind
               enemy lines and can’t dreamcraft?!
     Izzie grits her teeth, jumps onto Bunzai, hefting her weapon
     as the Night Terror shrieks towards them, claws out and --
     WHAM! Izzie and Bunzai leap up and take it out in one well
     placed blow! They land and she shoots Oz a cocky look --
     As she smiles, she doesn’t notice the nightmare tree behind
     her slowly reaching out, looming with its claw branches --
22                       MATEO                                    22
               Izzie!
                                                              4.

     Bunzai freaks. Rears up, spilling Izzie to the ground as the
     tree reaches out and --
     BLAM! The nightmare tree gets obliterated. The kids turn to
     see Oz holding his telescope rifle. A stern look on his face.
23                       MR. OZ                                23
               I’m saying make it count!
                   (composes himself)
               Look gang, it’s not just the
               Nightmare King’s forces we gotta
               worry about here. So we need to be
               disciplined and work together if
               we’re going to save Logan.
               Understood?
     The kids all trade a fearful look.
24                       ALBERT                                24
               Do try and hurry. I will keep the
               bridge door open as long as I can.
               But just in case...
     Albert gives Oz a small shiny metal ball contraption.
25                       COOPER                                25
                   (grabs the contraption)
               We all get new toys for this
               mission?
26                       ALBERT                                26
                   (hands it back to Oz)
               Young man, the Edison Bomb is not a
               toy, it’s a failsafe.
27                       MR. OZ                                27
                   (off Coop’s confusion)
               Plan B. When it detonates, it emits
               pure daylight. Bad news for any
               nightmare creatures in its radius.
28                       IZZIE                                 28
                   (getting amped up)
               Okay, alright... Storming the
               Shadowkeep! We can do this! What’s
               the plan? You’ve been in there,
               right Mr. Oz?
29                       MR. OZ                                29
                   (off guard)
               Whu-- You don’t just stroll into
               the Shadowkeep! We’re not on a
               field trip to a museum - this whole
               place is basically a wasteland of
               fears, phobias, and regret...
                                                                 5.

30                       ALBERT                                   30
               What your esteemed teacher is
               trying to say is... no.
31                       ZOEY                                     31
               Great, how are we supposed to sneak
               in there and find Logan if nobody’s
               ever been inside?
32                       MATEO                                    32
                   (spotting something)
               I don’t think we’re sneaking
               anywhere... C’mon!
     Mateo points in the distance: a small PATROL OF DARKLINGS on
     a hill spots the kids.
     The gang darts off towards the Darklings in the distance. We
     linger on the ominous keep at the horizon as a nightmare
     storm swirls in the sky. A SCREAM of pain prelaps and we --

5    INT. SHADOWKEEP - DAY                                            5
     SNEAK, SNIVEL, and SUSAN escort LOGAN through a dank, twisty
     tunnel. Coming to a stop outside the doors to the FEAR WORKS.
     DARK ARCHER stands with them, nursing his backside, shooting
     an accusing glare at the spear Sneak is holding.
33                       DARK ARCHER                              33
               How many times have a told you to
               watch where you point that thing!
     Archer smacks Sneak. Snivel and Susan howl with laughter.
     Archer shoots them a look. They button it up. He sighs.
34                       DARK ARCHER (CONT’D)                     34
               No matter how hard you try, fools
               never change...
     Archer motions threateningly, Sneak unlocks the dungeon door.
35                       DARK ARCHER (CONT’D)                     35
                   (turns to Logan)
               The foolish and the weak...
     Archer shakes his head at Logan.
36                       DARK ARCHER (CONT’D)                     36
               Nightmare King coulda’ helped you
               stop being both, kid.
     The door swings open. Logan’s eyes go wide: There before him
     is a room full of CONTAINMENT UNITS - dreaming KIDS in each
     one, their imaginations being siphoned out and funneled away
     by horrendous machinery.
                                                                 6.

37                       LOGAN                                    37
                   (trying to act tough)
               Like he’s helped you? How’s that
               working out? You’re one screw up
               away from being thrown in here with
               me...
     Archer hesitates. The other Darklings trade a look.
38                       LOGAN (CONT’D)                           38
               I know the feeling, bro. Lemme
               outta here before my friends show
               up and stop this whole freakshow.
               I’ll put in a good word for you.
39                       DARK ARCHER                              39
               You really don’t get it do you...
               Once we find Castle Nocturna and
               destroy it, NO ONE will be able to
               stop the Nightmare King.
     Archer locks eyes with Logan. Logan flinches. Dark Archer
     laughs. The gravity of the situation slams home with Logan.
40                       DARK ARCHER (CONT’D)                     40
               Here’s the sad truth kid, your
               friends aren’t coming because they
               don’t need you.
     Logan looks up at the Dark Archer, clearly wounded.
41                       DARK ARCHER (CONT’D)                     41
                   (straight to the point)
               You’re a loser, Logan.
42                       SNIVEL                                   42
               Hehehe, Loser Logan! Loser Logan!
     Logan trades a look with SNEAK who can’t meet his gaze.
43                       DARK ARCHER                              43
               Little bit of advice: choose better
               friends.
     Archer laughs as he turns and walks back down the hall.
     Snivel turns to the other two.
44                       SNIVEL                                   44
               Ssooo, who gets the honors?
     Sneak shoves Logan into the unit. The door CLANGS shut. He
     goes to lock it but fumbles with the keys, dropping them.
     Snivel growls, motions to Susan who barrels forwards and
     WHAM! Knocks Sneak to the ground. She looms over his limp
     body and picks up the keys.
                                                                 7.

45                       SUSAN                                    45
               You’re just as weak and pathetic as
               this loser here --
     Snivel turns and realizes the containment unit is empty.
     Logan is missing! He casts a panicked look around and sees --
     LO-LO, in full blue gremlin mode, swing off the top of the
     unit and --
     SLAM! Two feet right to Snivel’s face, sends him to the
     ground. Susan ROARS and CHARGES toward Lo-Lo like a freight
     train but --
     LO-LO jumps up, grabbing the containment unit cage and
     swinging out of the way as SUSAN rams into the nearby wall -
     slumping to the ground, out like a light.
     Lo-Lo lands back on the ground chest heaving, and stares down
     at Susan --
46                       LO-LO                                    46
               Who’s the loser now...
     He hears the sound of metal on stone and his eyes glance up
     to find --
     SNEAK standing in front of the exit, spear in hand. Lo-Lo
     locks eyes with Sneak... And Sneak lowers the spear.
     Lo-Lo slowly transitions back into Logan.
47                       LOGAN                                    47
               Why are you helping me? What’s in
               it for you?
48                        SNEAK                                   48
                   (beat)
               Better friends.

6    EXT. GRIM REALM - CANYON - MOMENTS LATER                         6
     The PATROL OF ROWDY DARKLINGS snakes through the fog, cackles
     echoing. As they round a bend in the canyon, they don’t see --
     THE DREAM CHASERS hiding amidst the rocks. The patrol marches
     past, bickering. As Mateo prepares to dreamcraft, Oz puts a
     restraining hand on him. Mateo frowns.
49                       MATEO                                    49
               <GROWLS> What am I supposed to do
               if I can’t dreamcraft?
50                       Izzie                                    50
                   (whispers)
               What would Logan do?
                                                                8.

51                       ZOEY                                    51
                   (hisses)
               Well, he certainly wouldn’t waste
               time talking about it...
     Zoey winds her clock. The whisps of fog suddenly seem to move
     backwards as TIME SLOWS... and Zoey darts out, her clock
     ticking, manipulating the scenario to close in on --
     THE PATROL OF DARKLINGS -- Zoey makes quick work of the
     patrol. Defeating three out of four.
     As she closes in on the LAST DARKLING, we watch in SLOW
     MOTION as his little face washes with alarm and --
     Zoey’s clock stops ticking... Time resumes normally.
52                       IZZIE                                   52
               WAIT! Don’t hurt him...
     Zoey has Last Darkling in her sights. Arrow aimed... she
     hesitates... trades a glance from Izzie to Mateo.
53                       MATEO                                   53
                   (shrugs)
               We do need someone to guide us to
               the Shadowkeep...
54                       ZOEY                                    54
                   (sighs)
               Fine...
55                       COOPER                                  55
               Uh guys... our guide is running
               away.
     The kids glance back to see the Darkling scrambling away
     through the canyon.
56                       MR. OZ                                  56
               We can’t let him warn the others!
     Mateo growls as they run after the fleeing Darkling.

7    INT. SHADOWKEEP - DAY                                           7
     A SWARM of NIGHT TERRORS snakes down the hall and flitters up
     through a tunnel-like passageway. As soon as they’re gone,
     Sneak peeks out from behind a shadowy corner. Signals behind
     him, and Logan quickly follows.
57                       SNEAK                                   57
                   (points at tunnel)
               That leads out of the Shadowkeep...
                                                                 9.

               We don’t want to get caught inside
               when more Night Terrors come
               through.
     The unlikely team slips out of their hiding spot and into the
     tunnel. But Logan shoots a glance at a room as they pass by
     and sees the Dark Archer standing at a worktable, tinkering
     with LUNA’S HOURGLASS.
     Dark Archer howls in frustration. SUSAN scurries down the
     hall. Sneak pulls Logan into the shadows as the Darkling
     passes. Logan strains to get a look --
     IN THE WORKSHOP
58                        DARK ARCHER                             58
               I said I didn’t want to be
               disturbed!
59                       SUSAN                                    59
               The loser has escaped...
     Archer puts the hourglass down. Anger surges through him.
60                        DARK ARCHER                             60
               How...
61                        SUSAN                                   61
               Sneak...
62                       DARK ARCHER                              62
               And yet His Scariness will blame
               me...
     Archer stands abruptly.
63                       DARK ARCHER (CONT’D)                     63
               But not if I find him first.
     ANGLE ON LOGAN as he recedes into the shadows of the tunnel.
64                       SUSAN                                    64
               Gotta hurry, boss. I heard Dream
               Chasers are in the Grim Realm.
65                       DARK ARCHER                              65
               Ahh, The loser has friends after
               all.
     Logan’s face washes with realization.
     Logan watches as Archer puts the hourglass in a heavy CHEST
     and then quickly exits with Susan in tow.
66                       SNEAK                                    66
               C’mon! What are you doing?
                                                                10.

67                       LOGAN                                    67
               Making things right...
     Logan makes sure the coast is clear and darts across the
     corridor to the --
     WORKSHOP -- And finds the chest. But it’s locked. Logan gets
     frustrated as Sneak scurries over.
68                       SNEAK                                    68
                   (hisses)
               We’re running out of time. Any
               minute that tunnel will be flooded
               with more Terrors...
69                       LOGAN                                    69
               I can’t get this thing open--
70                        SNEAK                                   70
               Of course you can’t! What were you
               thinking?!
71                       LOGAN                                    71
                   (growing frustrated)
               I don’t know! Mateo is usually the
               one to plan things out!
     Logan’s frustration boils over. He morphs into LO-LO...
     immediately starts pounding on the chest to no avail. He
     turns his angry little eyes to Sneak...
     Who fishes around under the worktable... and produces a
     SKELETON KEY. He holds it out as Logan transitions back into
     his normal appearance, scowling. Logan takes the key.
72                       LOGAN (CONT’D)                           72
               Don’t you start with me too...
     Night Terror shrieks suddenly echo down the hall.
73                       SNEAK                                    73
               Move it or lose it, Stinkbrain!
     Logan quickly unlocks the chest, finds Luna’s hourglass
     waiting. Logan grabs it and the two run.

8    INT. SHADOWKEEP - TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER                         8
     Logan and Sneak flee down the tunnel. Logan looks back over
     his shoulder. Can hear the Night Terror SHRIEKS getting
     louder.
     They get to a JUNCTION - Logan can see light above where one
     tunnel slopes up. And another that slopes down into darkness.
                                                                11.

74                       SNEAK                                    74
               Climb!
     Sneak starts up. The SHRIEKS grow louder, almost on top of
     them. Logan follows but can’t get enough traction. He slips
     and begins to slide.
75                       SNEAK (CONT’D)                           75
               Stinkbrain!
     Sneak reaches out and catches Logan, poised above the
     darkness and the tunnel below. Logan locks eyes with him.
76                       LOGAN                                    76
               Don’t you let me go--
     Sneak releases his grip and Logan drops down the tunnel into
     the darkness as we CUT TO --

9    EXT. GRIM REALM - HILLS                                          9
     The Dream Chasers scurry around a bend to find a fog-laden
     gulch dominated by a large cave opening at the end.
     Mateo glances around... nothing but a few scraggly trees
     looming in the fog. No Darkling in sight.
     As Cooper walks beneath a tree, he wipes cobwebs from his
     face. Gets a chill. Izzie spots something. GASP! The team
     turns to see her pick up a Darkling weapon from the ground...
     It’s covered in webs.
77                       MATEO                                    77
               Ugh, of course there’s spiders in
               the Grim Realm...
     Clicks and hisses echo out as a dozen little eyes appear in
     the darkness of the cave opening...
78                       MR. OZ                                   78
               Contrary to popular belief,
               dreaming of spiders isn’t
               necessarily a bad thing--
     The eyes move forward in unison, emerging from the darkness
     to reveal --
     ONE GIANT NIGHTMARE SPIDER who creepily steps into the light!
79                       ZOEY                                     79
               Uhh, yeah. That is totally a bad
               thing right there.
     The spider rears up, mandibles reaching for the dreamers as
     it ROARS!
                                                             12.

80                       MR. OZ                                   80
               RUN!
     The group scrambles away as the beast scuttles out. Cooper
     trips and falls and --
     WHAM! A giant hairy leg nearly skewers him. Zoey scoops Coop
     up and they keep running. Mateo suddenly veers off.
81                       ZOEY                                     81
               This is why I hate field trips...
                   (to Mateo)
               Teo! C’mon!
82                       MATEO                                    82
               Go! I’ll catch up!
     Zoey doesn’t need to be told twice. She drags Izzie with her.
83                       IZZIE                                    83
                   (reaching back)
               MATEO!
84                       MR. OZ                                   84
               What are you doing?!
85                       MATEO                                    85
               Making it count. Go! Find Logan!
     Teo takes hold of his hourglass. Light emanates like a
     beacon. The spider’s gaze immediately shifts from the group
     to Mateo, as he dreamcrafts Z Blob into Sir Z.
86                       MATEO (CONT’D)                           86
               Yeah... over here big guy. You want
               some of this? Lotta shiny
               creativity right here...
     Z Blob swings his sword at the ready. The giant spider fixes
     all of its eyes on Mateo, saliva dripping from its mandibles.
87                       MATEO (CONT’D)                           87
               Let’s see how well you fight with
               seven legs!
     Spider LUNGES! Z Blob swings! The sword bounces off his leg
     with a THUNK. The spider blinks and opens his mandibles. Z
     shoots a worried look to Mateo.
88                       MATEO (CONT’D)                           88
               Got any better ideas?
     The spider roars! Mateo and Z turn and run! Scrambling and
     fighting up the hill, leading the giant spider from the
     others as they run away.
                                                               13.

     It’s an epic swashbuckling fight up the craggy Grim Realm
     hills -- Z and Teo working in tandem to fight and deflect as
     the giant spider pursues them.
     Teo and Z crest the hill to see a nightmarish SWAMP laid out
     before them. Mateo glances back in time to see --
     THWUMP! A glob of webbing shoot out, snagging Z who falls to
     the ground. Teo doubles back, tugging and hacking to try and
     free his friend as the SPIDER scurries towards them and --
     SNAP! Z is free! But the momentum carries them backwards --
     TUMBLING down the hill! The fall reduces Z back into blob
     form, rolling off the hill and they --
     SPLASH! Disappear into the foggy waters of the swamp...
     The giant spider scuttles up to the crest. Eyes scanning the
     murk below. Clicking and hissing. But Mateo and Z Blob are
     nowhere to be found and we --
     CUT TO BLACK...

10   EXT. SHADOWKEEP - DAY                                        10
     Night Terrors flood up and out of the Shadowkeep and into the
     gloomy sky. Our gaze drifts down to the surrounding murk...
     WHOOSH! Logan and Sneak plummet out of from a grimy tunnel
     opening in the Keep walls and...
     SPLASH! Landing in the murky waters. Logan emerges,
     sputtering and coughing as Sneak tries to help him up. Logan
     shakes him off and stands.
89                       LOGAN                                    89
               What the heck, bro?! What was
               that?!

               That was me saving your worthless
               hide.
91                       LOGAN                                    91
               Yeah?! Well?! Thanks...
     Logan reaches down and plucks the hourglass out of the grime.
     Fixes it to his waist. Starts to get his bearings.
92                       SNEAK                                    92

                Whaddya mean? You’re free from the
                Nightmare King’s grasp. You know
                what I would give for that?!
95                        LOGAN                                 95

                    (sighs)
                Boss Man was right, Stinkbrain. You
                are a fool. But you ain’t weak,
                I’ll give you that. Thick as a
                brick. And cocky too, but not--
97                        LOGAN                                 97
                Okay, okay...
98                        SNEAK                                 98
                Well c’mon then.
                    (off Logan’s skepticism)
                What, you think I’m hanging around
                this dump to see if his Royal
                Scariness notices you’re missing?
      Logan manages a grin. And we CUT TO --

11    EXT. GRIM REALM - DAY                                     11
      Oz and the others wait at the edge of the canyon, looking out
      across the swamp that lies between them and the Shadowkeep.
      Zoey quietly joins them, out of breath...
99                        IZZIE                                 99
                Did you find him?
100                       ZOEY                                 100
                    (shakes her head)
                Maybe he woke up?
101                        MR. OZ                              101
                He knows there are too many bad
                dreams out here that could cross
                over if he did.
                    (beat)
                We have to trust Mateo knows what
                he’s doing and stick to the plan.
102                       IZZIE                                102
                You guys can stick to the plan. I’m
                going back for my brother!
103                       ZOEY                                 103
                Don’t be ridiculous! You won’t make
                it out there on your own.
                                                                 15.

104                       IZZIE                                   104
                Who said I’d be alone...
      Izzie reaches for her hourglass.
105                       MR. OZ                                  105
                Isabel! Not again, we’ve already
                been through this--
      But Izzie dreamcrafts Bunzai! Lighting up the gloom. The
      Dream Chasers hold their breath. Scanning the area.
106                       IZZIE                                   106
                See it’s fine--
      The sound of the Dark Archer’s signature TUNE echo out
      through the hills.
107                       ZOEY                                    107
                No...
108                       DARK ARCHER (O.S.)                      108
                I was waiting for you to do
                something foolish. You don’t
                disappoint, kid.
      THWIP! A SHADOW BOLT thuds into the ground next to Bunzai! He
      rears up, startled. The kids glance over to see --
      THE DARK ARCHER standing atop a hill, his crossbow aimed.
109                       DARK ARCHER (CONT’D)                    109
                Throw down your hourglasses or the
                next one doesn’t miss...
      The kids shoot Oz a worried glance. Izzie grips her
      hourglass.
110                       DARK ARCHER (CONT’D)                    110
                Go ahead! I could use another one
                of your pets to experiment on...
111                       IZZIE                                   111
                You monster...
112                       COOPER                                  112
                    (whispers)
                Zoey, use your clock...
113                       ZOEY                                    113
                    (hisses)
                I can’t... I’m out of time.
114                       DARK ARCHER                             114
                I’m not going to ask again, Ozzie.
                Throw down your hourglasses!
                                                              16.

      Oz nods to the kids... then drops his hourglass. The kids
      reluctantly follow suit. Izzie is the last to do so, reducing
      Bunzai to plushie form and scooping him up protectively.
115                       DARK ARCHER (CONT’D)                    115
                Take their weapons!
      Snivel and Susan burst out of the shadows, leading a small
      PACK OF SNARLING DARKLINGS out towards the Dream Chasers.
      The Darklings cackle and argue as they strip the Dream
      Chasers of their weapons. Oz trades an uneasy look with the
      kids.

12    EXT. NIGHTMARE SWAMP - DAY                                   12
      The surface of the muddy water is suddenly broken as Z Blob’s
      little eyes emerge... followed by the rest of him but --
      He’s in the shape of an old diving helmet encasing Mateo’s
      head as the two emerge from the swamp like deep sea divers.
      They cautiously scan the area before Teo trudges to the
      craggy shore, removes the helmet, and Z pops into blob form.
116                       MATEO                                   116
                Well, that could’ve gone better...
      Teo puts Z on his shoulder and climbs up the rocky hill. As
      he gets to the top, he suddenly flattens out on his belly.
      Mateo grabs Z Blob, quickly glancing around before
      dreamcrafting him into a PAIR OF BINOCULARS.
      Teo army crawls back to the top, looks out --
      THROUGH THE BINOCULARS -- There’s the Dark Archer... and
      Teo’s friends being prodded towards the hulking form of a
      GRIMHOLD...
117                        MATEO (O.S.) (CONT’D)                  117
                Oh no...
      As his gaze drifts up the intimidating Grimhold --
      SOMETHING BLOCKS HIS VIEW! Mateo drop the binoculars to see --
      A DARKLING snarling in his face! He yelps as the monster
      grabs at him! Teo instictively wrestles the creature and they
      go tumbling back down to the edge of the swamp with a THUD!
      Mateo scrambles to his feet. Ready to fight and --
118                       LOGAN (O.S.)                            118
                Do you wanna get yourself caught?!
                                                                17.

      Mateo glances over to see Logan scrambling towards him.
119                       MATEO                                   119
                Logan?! Look out there’s--
      Logan calmly reaches down and helps Sneak up.
120                       MATEO (CONT’D)                          120
                Wait... what are you doing?
121                       LOGAN                                   121
                Helping him up, what are you doing?
122                       MATEO                                   122
                We were trying to rescue you...
      Sneak smiles. Trying to defuse the situation.
123                       SNEAK                                   123
                That’s real sweet an all but--
124                       LOGAN                                   124
                Bro, I’m not the one who needs
                rescuing. Clearly.
125                       MATEO                                   125
                We wouldn’t even be out here if you
                hadn’t stolen the hourglass!
126                       LOGAN                                   126
                I knew that’s what this was all
                about...
127                       MATEO                                   127
                What? No...
      Logan forces a laugh. Shakes his head. Trades a look with
      Sneak who stops smiling - this reunion is going terribly.
128                        LOGAN                                  128
                Guess your boss man was right about
                something.
      Logan unbuckles the hourglass and offers it out to Mateo.
129                       MATEO                                   129
                Whatever... I don’t have time for
                this.
      Mateo takes the hourglass. Turns to leave. Logan stoic. Sneak
      glancing at both of them like WTF?!
130                       SNEAK                                   130
                Wait, wait! Where are you going?
                                                                 18.

131                       MATEO                                   131
                    (starts walking off)
                My friends are out there!
132                       SNEAK                                   132
                That’s funny. This one here said
                the same thing earlier...
      Mateo hesitates.
133                       SNEAK (CONT’D)                          133
                Shoulda’ woke up after he got outta
                the Shadowkeep. But ol Stinkbrain
                had to make sure you all were safe.
      Mateo turns back. Finally nods begrudgingly. Thrusts the
      hourglass back in Logan’s hands.
134                       MATEO                                   134
                You’re gonna give this back to Mr.
                Oz.
      Logan takes the hourglass. Takes a deep breath. Nods.
135                       LOGAN                                   135
                What’s your plan?
136                       MATEO                                   136
                Honestly, I was just gonna charge
                in there like you would.
137                       LOGAN                                   137
                Bro, you need a plan. C’mon. You’re
                the creative one...
138                       MATEO                                   138
                Yeah well every time I dreamcraft
                out here, bad things happen.
139                       LOGAN                                   139

                So, what would you do?
141                       LOGAN                                   141
                Psshht! Wait, are you really askin’
                me?
                    (Mateo nods)
                Well, I mean, how bad are we
                talking?
142                       MATEO                                   142
                You scared of spiders?
143                       SNEAK                                   143

      Mateo slowly turns to stare at Sneak... His gears turning.
144                       LOGAN                                   144
                What are you thinking?
145                       MATEO                                   145
                It’s a terrible idea...
146                       LOGAN                                   146
                Yo... stop with that mess. Terrible
                or not, least you got something.
      Mateo nods.
147                       MATEO                                   147
                Okay, check it out...

13    EXT. GRIM REALM - DARKLING CAMP - DAY                        13
      Scraggly nightmare trees surround a small darkling camp
      nestled in the gloomy hills. An unnatural campfire burns,
      shedding light on the --
      The Dream Chasers’ hourglasses and weapons being tossed in a
      pile.
      ANGLE CHANGES TO REVEAL Oz and the Dream Chasers being
      prodded towards a towering GRIMHOLD and the open cage of his
      belly.
148                       COOPER                                  148
                Guys, once we’re stuck in that
                cage, we’re not waking up...
149                       MR. OZ                                  149
                    (searching his beard)
                I know, I know. I’m working on
                it...
150                       ZOEY                                    150
                    (whispers)
                What are you looking for?!
      Oz finally finds what he’s searching for. Discretely pulls
      the Edison Bomb from his beard.
151                       MR. OZ                                  151
                Plan B...
                    (grunts)
                Okay, when I detonate this, get
                ready to make a break for it--

      A CLUELESS DARKLING picks up Oz’s telescope blaster from the
      pile. Curiously pulls the trigger and BLAM! A blast
      harmlessly streaks into the sky --
      Startling Oz! Who drops the Edison Bomb. The gang gasps,
      staring wide-eyed as it rolls unseen towards --
      DARK ARCHER... Stepping over it as he snatches the blaster
      from Clueless Darkling, smacking him.
      Cackles of laughter burst out of the small squad of
      RAMBUNCTIOUS DARKLINGS as Archer tosses the blaster back on
      the pile and turns to Susan at his side --
152                       SUSAN                                   152
                Not bad for a night’s work, eh
                boss?
153                        DARK ARCHER                            153
                Sneak and his loser friend will
                have no choice but to come running
                back now--
      Archer marches off with Snivel and Susan in tow. No one
      noticed the Edison Bomb. Oz and the kids manage a smile of
      relief.
      They are marched closer to the Grimhold, Oz almost to where
      the bomb stopped rolling but --
      Clueless Darkling picks it up... Begins to futz with the
      bomb, trying to figure out what it is. Oz groans with defeat.
154                       IZZIE                                   154
                Got a plan C in that beard?
      Oz shoots Izzie an exhausted look. Clearly he doesn’t.
155                       COOPER                                  155
                    (panicked)
                I’m not getting trapped in one of
                those things again...
      The Grimhold cage swings open. The Darkling guards prod the
      Dream Chasers forward... Grimhold’s claw reaching out...
      ANGLE ON The Dark Archer and Susan marching back to the
      Sharkface Airship moored nearby. Archer looks up in time to
      see --
      SNEAK AND LO-LO bounding down the hillside towards them!
156                       SNIVEL                                  156
                Boss, when you’re right, you’re--
      Snivel SCREAMS in fear! Archer’s expression falls when he
      sees what Sneak and Lo-Lo are running from --
                                                               21.

      THE NIGHTMARE SPIDER rampaging into the camp...
      Darklings scatter in panic! Except for --
      Clueless Darkling finally activates the Edison Bomb. It
      starts to BEEP a countdown. He looks at it curiously as --
      MUNCH! The spider swallows him and the bomb whole. Turns its
      scary eyes towards the Dream Chasers...
      The gang screams! The Spider moves closer and --
      WHAM! The Grimhold smacks it! The gang scrambles for cover as
      the two giants go at it. We can hear the loud countdown BEEP
      BEEP BEEPING from inside the spider’s belly.
      In the chaos, Oz and kids scramble back to the pile of their
      equipment, quickly scooping up their belongings. Zoey grabs
      her bow, turns to see --
      LO-LO and SNEAK bounding towards them. Zoey takes aim and --
157                       MATEO                                 157
                WAIT!
      Mateo leaps in front of Lo-Lo. Hands in the air!
158                       ZOEY                                  158
                Teo?!
159                       MATEO                                 159
                That’s Logan! It’s Logan!
      Zoey stares at Lo-Lo, still aiming. Trying to process.
160                       LO-LO                                 160
                What up girl...
      Izzie rushes up and hugs Teo. Then --
161                       IZZIE                                 161
                Don’t you ever do something like
                that again, you big turkey!
162                       MATEO                                 162
                Missed you too.
      Lo-Lo morphs back into Logan. Coop stares at him, mouth open.
163                       LOGAN                                 163
                Bro, don’t even ask.
      Oz puts his hand on Logan’s shoulder. Logan hands him Luna’s
      hourglass.
164                       LOGAN (CONT’D)                        164
                Mr. Oz, I’m --
                                                                 22.

165                       MR. OZ                                  165
                I’m just glad you’re okay, son.
      BOOM! WHAM! ROAR! The kids glance over to see the Grimhold
      and spider still duking it out. Their fight taking them away
      from the camp.
166                       MR. OZ (CONT’D)                         166
                Save the reunion speeches! We’ve
                got to get back to the bridge door!
      One by one the Dream Chasers dreamcraft... working in
      unison... Izzie on Bunzai, Teo on Sir Z... Logan morphing
      into Lo-Lo as he leaps up and into... the truck Coop crafts.
167                       LO-LO                                   167
                Drive it like you stole it!
      The Dark Archer tries to rally the few remaining Darklings.
      But Zoey picks off a few as Teo and Z Blob make a hole in
      their ranks.
      Snivel and Susan come gunning for Sneak but Coop roars up in
      his truck with Oz in the back, blasting away.
      Snivel and Susan dive for cover as Sneak leaps in. Zoey
      shoots one more look at Archer as she jumps in back and
      Coop’s truck takes off.
168                       DARK ARCHER                             168
                Stop them! Do not let them escape!
      Archer struggles to get Sharkface airborne as the last of his
      Darkling squad takes off on foot after the Dream Chasers.

14    EXT. GRIM REALM - LATER                                      14
      Oz and the Dream Chasers flee across the wasteland. Finally
      reaching the hillside rendezvous.
      Cooper’s truck sputters. He looks down at his hourglass.
169                       COOPER                                  169
                I’m tapped!
      His truck starts to de-materialize... dumping the occupants.
      As the gang scrambles up the remainder of the hill, Bunzai
      reduces to a plushie...
170                        IZZIE                                  170
                I’m out!
      They crest the hill... but Albert and the Bridge door are
      nowhere to be found.
                                                                 23.

171                       MR. OZ                                  171
                    (disappointed)
                Albert...
172                       LOGAN                                   172
                Always thought that monkey was
                pretty suspect...
      The gang turns around to face the small squad of Darklings
      encircling them...
173                       IZZIE                                   173
                Is it safe to wake up yet?
174                       MR. OZ                                  174
                Definitely not.
      OZ’S ROCKET SHIP rises into view! The door opens. Albert
      lowers the ladder --
175                       ALBERT                                  175
                Well what are you waiting for, a
                formal invitation?

15    INT. OZ’S ROCKET SHIP - MOMENTS LATER                        15
      One by one, the gang scurries into the ship. Oz, the last in
      line as he climbs up.
      Albert sees Sneak crawl aboard. Shoots him a disgusted look --
176                       LOGAN                                   176
                He’s rolling with me back to the
                landing. Any questions?
      Sneak struggles to hide his surprise. Clearly touched.
177                       ALBERT                                  177
                Plenty, as a matter of fact, but --
      The door slams shut.
178                       MR. OZ                                  178
                Well. That was exciting, wasn’t it.
      BOOM! The door of the ship suddenly flies off!
      OUTSIDE -- The Sharkface airship looms, Oz’s ship door
      clutched in its grapplinghook like a souvenir.
      INSIDE -- Debris flies around the ship! Several of Oz’s
      things go tumbling out, including Oz and --
      MATEO scrambles to the door, Z Blob on his shoulder, grabs
      Mr. Oz’s hand just as --
                                                               24.

      The hourglass flies out of the door along with more debris.
179                       MATEO                                   179
                No!
      Mateo pulls Oz to safety. He lands in a heap inside the ship.
180                       MR. OZ                                  180
                Albert! Get us out of here!
181                       LOGAN                                   181
                Wait! The hourglass!
      Oz looks at Logan. Then smiles --
182                       MR. OZ                                  182
                It’s okay. We got what we came here
                for, didn’t we?
      Logan fights back a surge of emotion. Then leaps out!
      Mateo and Sneak trade a look... then both leap out after!

16    EXT. GRIM REALM - HILLTOP - MOMENTS LATER                    16
      Logan rushes towards the hourglass lying on the ground...
      Scrambling up to it as --
      The remaining squad of Darklings encircles him. Sharkface
      hovering overhead. Archer’s laughter echoing out.
      Mateo and Sneak rush up!
183                       LOGAN                                   183
                The heck are you guys thinking?!
184                       MATEO                                   184
                Eh, what would Logan do?!
185                       SNEAK                                   185
                What are friends for, Stinkbrain...
      The kids look to the Darklings, Logan morphs into Lo-Lo. The
      three friends bracing for a fight.
      Darklings snarl, drool, laugh maniacally. This is gonna get
      ugly. But then they stop as we hear --
      BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The Darklings trade a confused look.
      A shadow falls over our heroes... everyone turns to see --
      THE GIANT NIGHTMARE SPIDER cresting the hilltop. Madibles
      dripping with saliva... It rears up and --
                                                                 25.

      BOOM! Just as Oz promised, an explosion of pure light
      radiates out from the spider, instantly evaporating the
      nightmare creatures...
      ANGLE ON OZ’S SHIP as the gang shields their eyes and --
      ANGLE ON SHARKFACE - Archer, Snivel and Susan on deck as the
      ship banks away from the blast radius.
      BACK ON - Teo, Logan, and Z as they slowly open their eyes to
      find they are no longer surrounded. The spider and all the
      Darklings gone. Just particles of ether floating in the wind.
      Including Sneak... Logan’s eyes widen in realization.
186                       LOGAN                                   186
                No...
      Logan finds something on the ground... the hat he gave Sneak.
187                       LOGAN (CONT’D)                          187
                No!
      Several shadow bolts THUD into the ground.
188                       MATEO                                   188
                    (picking up the hourglass)
                Logan... Wake up! We gotta wake up
                NOW!

17    INT. OZ’S ROCKET SHIP - CONTINUOUS                           17
      Oz and the kids watch from above as Mateo, Logan, and Z Blob
      wake up below.
189                       MR. OZ                                  189
                Go, Albert! Let’s go!
      EXT. SHARKFACE AIRSHIP - CONTINUOUS
      The Dark Archer watches the scene from the deck of Sharkface.
      As Oz’s ship takes off, his mind races... As we DISSOLVE TO --

18    INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY (WAKING WORLD) - DAY                     18
      The Dream Chasers stand in front of the glass trophy case.
      Zoey takes a group shot of the team with the trophy displayed
      behind them. Logan has his hat in his hand.
190                       MATEO                                   190
                Zoey, you sure you don’t want to be
                in the shot with us?
                                                                 26.

                Then there would be photographic
                evidence she participated. Can’t
                have that.
192                       ZOEY                                    192
                    (sarcastically)
                Say sheeeeeep!
193                       COOPER                                  193
                    (to Logan)
                There. Now you can show your moms
                you’re so good, you can win even in
                your sleep.
194                       LOGAN                                   194
                I don’t think it counts if I wasn’t
                actually here.
195                       IZZIE                                   195
                Please. You’re part of our team.
196                       MATEO                                   196
                And we’re all here now. That’s what
                counts, right?
      Logan looks down at his hat. Clearly missing his friend.
197                       LOGAN                                   197
                Yeah...
      Logan puts on his hat. We DISSOLVE TO --
      LOGAN’S POV... but it’s wavy and distorted. We pull out to
      reveal that we are watching the Waking World through --

19    INT. SHADOWKEEP - CONTINUOUS                                 19
      The Nightmare King stands in the spawning room, staff in hand
      as a DARKLING loads a canister of imagination into the
      machinery.
      Dark Archer sulks into the room. Realizes he’s looking at the
      Waking World projected from the staff.
198                        DARK ARCHER                            198

                No thanks to you.
                    (sighs)
                I try to be patient, after
                everything you did to free me but--

                I didn’t help the loser escape. It
                was that traitor Sneak!
      The Nightmare King spawns a Darkling. As it rises, we realize
      it is SNEAK... born anew from the dark machinery. Sneak
      collects himself. Realizing where he is and stepping
      protectively behind the Nightmare King.
201                       NIGHTMARE KING                       201
                This traitor?
                    (overcome by laughter)
                How do you think I got an Eye on
                the Dream Chasers in the first
                place?
      Archer takes in the scene. The Dream Chasers’ every move
      projects before the Nightmare King. Sneak watches, too. His
      expression especially glum.
202                       NIGHTMARE KING (CONT’D)              202
                And you almost ruined it.
                    (stops laughing)
                Gimme one good reason why I
                shouldn’t banish you forever?
      Nightmare King stares at Archer. He panics. Then --
203                       DARK ARCHER                          203
                The little artiste’s green friend!
204                       NIGHTMARE KING                       204
                What?
205                       DARK ARCHER                          205
                He can cross over! I watched it
                happen! If that blob, that dream
                creature can cross over... Do you
                know what this means?!
      Nightmare King lowers his staff. Sneak looks from one villain
      to the other. Wondering what does this mean?!
206                       DARK ARCHER (CONT’D)                 206
                Your Frightfulness, Why focus all
                your efforts on reshaping the Dream
                World--
207                       NIGHTMARE KING                       207
                When I can take over the Waking
                World and show everyone a nightmare
                they’ll never forget.
      Nightmare King projects an image from his staff:
      Z Blob... now in his sights. As shadows darken the edge of
      our frame we CUT TO BLACK... END OF EPISODE
