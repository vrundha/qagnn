    OPEN ON ZOEY, astride ZION, swooping over the landing. She
    scours the horizon for Oz’ rocket ship bus. From her vantage
    point, we see --

    MATEO, IZZIE, Z BLOB, LOGAN and COOPER gathered together.
    Logan looks up, locks eyes with her. Lifts a hand to wave,
    then stops himself. Zoey swings Zion around, staying in the
    air a little longer.

    ON Mateo, clocking the hurt in Logan’s eyes. Logan feels his
    gaze.

1                       LOGAN                                     1
              Dude, what?

    Logan stomps off. Cooper shrugs, follows Logan over to the
    other side of the landing. Mateo turns to Izzie, confused.

2                       MATEO                                     2
              What’s Logan’s problem?

3                       IZZIE                                     3
              Firstly, when is Logan NOT in a
              mood? Secondly, he asked Zoey out,
              but she shut him down hard.
                  (shrugs)
              Maybe she likes someone else.

    Mateo can’t help it -- he perks up. Exchanges a hopeful
    glance with Z Blob, who flashes an encouraging grin. Mateo
    cocks an eyebrow at Izzie.

4                       MATEO                                     4
              How do you know all this anyways?

    Izzie waggles her hands in front of her face mysteriously.

5                       IZZIE                                     5
              I see and know alllllllll.

    Mateo’s unsure whether to laugh or be worried. Zoey swoops by
    overhead --

6                       ZOEY                                      6
              They’re here!

    Mateo looks up and spots OZ’S ROCKET SHIP BUS as --

3      EXT. LANDING (DREAM WORLD) - DAY                              3

       MR. OZ, holding LUNA’S HOURGLASS, and ALBERT emerge from the
       ship. Albert whistles loudly for everyone’s attention.

7                          MR. OZ                                    7
                 Huddle up. Let’s hear what Cooper’s
                 figured out.

       Oz hands the Hourglass to Cooper, who steps forward.

8                          COOPER                                    8
                 Okay, the key to unlocking Luna’s
                 Hourglass was realizing that things
                 aren’t always what they seem.

9                          LOGAN                                     9
                 Dude, you sound like Mrs. C.

       Albert waggles his eyebrows at Logan disapprovingly as Cooper
       gestures to THREE RINGS at the top, middle, and bottom of the
       Hourglass. Each ring is emblazoned with DECORATIVE IMAGES.

10                          COOPER                                  10
                 See the symbols on these rings?
                 They’re actually...
                     (wait for it)
                 A cryptex!

11                         IZZIE                                    11
                 A what-tex?

12                         ALBERT                                   12
                 Cryptex. It’s a kind of old-
                 fashioned puzzle.

13                         COOPER                                   13
                     (excited)
                 You rotate the rings into the
                 correct position and boom! Puzzle
                 solved and we’re on our way to
                 Castle Nocturna.

       Excited, Izzie hugs Zoey then does a little victory dance.

14                         IZZIE                                    14
                 Going to the castle! Going to meet
                 Luna! Going to have some awesome
                 snacks!
                     (off Albert’s stern look)
                 And ask her how she defeated the
                 Nightmare King.

15                         MATEO                                    15
                     (to Cooper)
                 So which symbols unlock the puzzle?

16                         COOPER                                   16
                     (prevaricating)
                 Yeah, about that...

17                         ZOEY                                     17
                 You have no idea, do you?

18                         COOPER                                   18
                     (upbeat)
                 Nope. But hey, it’s a start.

19                         ALBERT                                   19
                     (groans)
                 There’s thousands of possible
                 combinations to a cryptex. This
                 could take forever.

       Oz and Albert look concerned but the kids are undeterred.

20                         MATEO                                    20
                     (determined)
                 Not if we can help it. Let’s see
                 the first ring, Coop.

       Cooper holds up the Hourglass -- the first ring is emblazoned
       with letters, animals, flowers, etc. Mateo spots a MOON.

21                         MATEO (CONT'D)                           21
                 There! The moon could stand for
                 Luna!

       Cooper spins the first ring so the moon symbol is in front.
       As it CLICKS into place, the hourglass GLOWS.

22                         ZOEY                                     22
                 Sweet! Nice work, Mateo.

       Mateo grins under Zoey’s praise. Logan glares. As everyone
       starts throwing out guesses for the second ring (some of
       which Coop tries but don’t work) --

23                         IZZIE                                    23
                     (sotto, to Teo)
                 Um, did Zoey just compliment you?

24                         MATEO                                    24
                     (sotto, to Izzie)
                 Yeah, super weird.

       But Mateo’s wheels are spinning -- maybe Zoey likes him.
     LEGO 07/12/21       "The Worthy Dreamer"                      4.


25                         LOGAN                                    25
                 Look! An infinity symbol. That
                 could refer to all the realms under
                 a Dream Keeper’s protection.

       Cooper spins the infinity symbol to the front of the second
       ring. As it CLICKS into place, the hourglass GLOWS again.
       Logan fist pumps. Peeks at Zoey for a reaction. She’s giving
       him nothing. She studies the third ring...

26                         ZOEY                                     26
                 Maybe that olive branch symbolizes
                 peace.

       Cooper high-fives Zoey... spins the third ring into place...
       all the symbols line up... and the Hourglass suddenly BLAZES
       with light!

       Everyone shields their eyes... and then... all the sand falls
       out! Cooper groans.

27                         IZZIE                                    27
                 That was s’posed to happen, right?

28                         LOGAN                                    28
                 Dude, you broke it!

       Our team deflates. Suddenly... WHOOSH! The sand zooms off
       like a comet! As the others stare, stunned, Zoey leaps
       astride Zion and takes to the skies.

29                           ZOEY                                   29
                 Zion, go!

       Oz recovers first, races for the Rocket Bus.

30                         MR. OZ                                   30
                 After that sand, Dream Chasers!

       As our team sprints towards the ship, CUT TO --

       CLOSE ON MRS. CASTILLO snoozing peacefully at the window of
       her food truck.

       WIDEN OUT to reveal SEÑOR TORTUGA munching on a gingerbread
       house as an annoyed GINGERBREAD COUPLE watch. Suddenly, the
       couple catch sight of something O.S. and gape.

31                         GINGERBREAD MAN                          31

     LEGO 07/12/21       "The Worthy Dreamer"                     5.


       BAWOOSH! Oz’s rocket ship BLASTS by, blowing the gingerbread
       couple off their feet.

32                         GINGERBREAD MAN/GINGERBREAD WOMAN       32
                 Whoooaaaa! / Oh sugar!

       Off Mrs. C undisturbed, snoring loudly, CUT TO --


5      INT. OZ’S ROCKET SHIP - DAY - CONTINUOUS                        5

       Z Blob jiggles happily in his seat from the velocity of the
       bus rocketing through the dream ether. DREAM REALMS pass by
       the bus windows in a blur.

       WIDEN OUT to reveal Mateo, Logan, Cooper, and Izzie in their
       seats. Oz and Albert in front, manning the controls. Mateo
       cranes his neck to see outside.

33                         MATEO                                   33
                 There’s Zoey!

34                         LOGAN                                   34
                     (worried)
                 Where? Is she okay?

       Logan unbuckles his seatbelt and stands. Awkwardly leans
       across Mateo to look out.

       OUTSIDE -- Zoey and Zion hot on the sand comet’s tail. They
       bank left and right, following the comet’s every move.
       Suddenly, WHOOSH! The sand comet flies straight up --

       Oz jerks the controls sharply. Takes the bus vertical. Logan
       tumbles down the center aisle, hits the bulkhead door. THWAP!

35                         MATEO                                   35
                     (to Z Blob)
                 Think Logan will ever learn to stay
                 buckled in when Oz is at the wheel?

       Z Blob shakes his head ‘no’ as we CUT TO --


6      EXT. SKIES (DREAM WORLD) – CONTINUOUS                           6

       An epic shot of Zoey, Zion, and the rocket ship bus streaking
       through puffy pink clouds of Dream Ether after the sand
       comet. As the sand zooms higher and higher, the clouds get
       thicker and thicker until...

7      INT. OZ’S ROCKET SHIP - DAY - CONTINUOUS                         7

       Oz and Albert peer out the window into a seemingly endless
       layer of ominous, grey clouds.

36                         ALBERT                                   36
                 This is starting to feel like a
                 wild goose chase, Oswald.

37                         MR. OZ                                   37
                 I’ve never understood that analogy.
                 Are we the geese? Or the ones
                 chasing the geese?

       ON Mateo and Z Blob, gazing intently out the window.

38                         MATEO                                    38
                 C’mon, castle. Please be here... we
                 need Luna’s help to stop the Dark
                 Army.

       As if in answer to Mateo’s plea, the clouds part and we
       suddenly see... CASTLE NOCTURNA!

       It’s a CRYSTALLINE MEDIEVAL CASTLE towering over a barren
       rocky realm. (Think Jim Henson’s Dark Crystal meets
       Superman’s Fortress of Solitude.) The kind of place that
       could only exist in the Dream World. The kids are awestruck.

39                         MATEO/IZZIE/COOPER                       39
                 Holy cow. / Daaaang. / Whoa.

       Nearing the end of their long search, Oz and Albert beam.

40                         ALBERT                                   40
                 We made it, old friend.

       Logan picks himself up off the floor to peer outside.

41                          LOGAN                                   41
                     (awed)
                 It’s... it’s...


8      EXT. ROCKY REALM (DREAM WORLD) – MOMENTS LATER                   8

       ON Logan, aghast.

42                         LOGAN                                    42
                     (aghast)
                 A pile of crap.
     LEGO 07/12/21       "The Worthy Dreamer"                      7.


       REVERSE to reveal Castle Nocturna’s true state. Up close, the
       crystalline castle’s walls are dirty, dull and overgrown with
       THICK VINES. The place is dormant, uninviting, and creepy.

       The sand swirls back into Luna’s Hourglass, settles inside.
       Our team brightens. An expectant beat. Nothing happens.

43                         MR. OZ                                   43
                 Luna would never leave the castle
                 in such a state.
                     (stricken)
                 She’s really gone...

       His worst fears seemingly realized, Oz is overcome with
       emotion. Albert places a comforting hand on his shoulder.

44                         COOPER                                   44
                 So... we got this far for nothing?

45                         MR. OZ                                   45
                     (composes himself)
                 Not necessarily. In our research,
                 Albert and I discovered that Luna
                 made a record of how to defeat the
                 Nightmare King before she vanished.

46                         ALBERT                                   46
                 And Logan heard the Nightmare King
                 say he wanted to erase the story of

       in... dark shadows dot the edges of the room.

       A long BANQUET TABLE in the middle is set for dinner but
       covered in cobwebs. Dusty shields and tapestries decorate the
       walls. The space feels eerie and dead.

                 And I thought it was creepy
                 outside.

       Izzie catches sight of a LARGE HERALDIC TAPESTRY that piques
       her interest. It’s of a strange animal that our keen-eyed
       viewers will recognize as a MANTICORE -- head of a man, body
       of a lion, and a tail with a prickle of sharp spikes.

51                         IZZIE                                    51

                 Don’t listen to her, Coop.
                 Manticore’s ARE real. I’ve read
                 about them in my mythology books.

       Zoey rolls her eyes -- the talk of myths proving her point.

                 A porcupine tail on a lion’s body?
                 Not real. Not scary.

                 Who would do this to Dreamlings?!

61                         COOPER                                   61
                 I thought Castle Nocturna was
                 supposed to be safe!

       The kids shuffle around. Afraid. Oz tries to hide it, but
       it’s clear he’s shook, too.

62                         MR. OZ                                   62

                 Don’t worry, I’m sure whatever did
                 this is long gone.

       Just then, the tapestries whip, disturbed by an eerie wind.
       And then --

       SNAP! The sound of a tail cracking like a whip. WHOOSH! A
       poisonous QUILL streaks through the air --

       SHUNK! The quill hits Oz and he turns to crystal!

63                            ALBERT                                63
                 Oswald!

       Izzie points to the quill, horrified.

64                         IZZIE                                    64
                 A manticore!

       Before anyone can react, Zion catches sight of something
       slinking through the shadows... takes off after it!

       Zoey sprints after Zion. We hear the SNAP of a tail. Then
       WHOOSH! A poisonous quill flies from the shadows and...
       SHUNK! The QUILL pierces Zion’s side and he turns to crystal!

65                            ZOEY                                  65
                 Zion, NO!!

       The rest of the team catches up with Zoey as she throws her
       arms around Zion.

                 I’ll fix this. Promise.

       Logan goes to grab Zoey’s arm, stops himself. Pleads.

       Panicked, the team races through large doors at the end of
       the Great Hall and into...


10     INT. CASTLE NOCTURNA – HALLWAY – CONTINUOUS                  10

       A long hallway, grimy from years of neglect. Logan and Cooper
       SLAM the doors shut. RAAAGHH! A giant roar echoes. The door
       RATTLES with the force of something large but holds fast.

69                         COOPER                                   69
                 What do we do?

70                         ALBERT                                   70
                 Stay focused. Find the book.

71                         ZOEY                                     71
                 Screw that, I’m looking for a way
                 to fix Zion.

       Logan opens his mouth to offer to help. Mateo beats him to
       the punch.

72                         MATEO                                    72
                 I’ll go with you.

       BOOM! The door RATTLES again.

73                         ALBERT                                   73
                 Fine, just steer clear of the
                 manticore. Everyone else, with me.

74                          IZZIE                                   74
                      (animal expert mode)
                 Manticore’s usually only react when
                 provoked. Maybe we can reason with
                 him.

       On cue, BOOOOM! A large PAW PUNCHES through the door,
       narrowly missing Izzie’s head! Wood splinters fly!

                 On second thought... RUN!!

       They sprint away, desperate to put some distance between them
       and the creature! All of a sudden --

       KRAAAK! FWOOSH! The hallway breaks into several pieces that
       SWING APART in different directions (think Hogwarts meets MC
       Escher)! The kids stumble, trying to keep their balance.

76                            MATEO/IZZIE/ZOEY/LOGAN/COOPER         76
                 WHOAAAAAA!

       ON Zoey, as the piece she’s on tilts precariously, sending
       her sliding towards the edge. She nimbly leaps from one piece
       to another... trying to reunite with the others. But she’s
       thwarted by the MC Escher-esque castle.

       Zoey spots Logan, on a piece with Izzie, gesturing for her to
       jump to him.

77                         LOGAN                                    77
                 Zoey! Jump this way!

       At the same time, Mateo, on a piece with Z Blob, whooshes
       past, too. Waves for Zoey to join him.

78                         MATEO                                    78
                 Zoey, we’re here!

       Zoey’s eyes dart from Mateo to Logan. She runs, leaps --

       WHAM! Knocks Mateo down. Lands on top of him!

79                            MATEO (CONT'D)                        79
                 Oof.

       From his prone position, Mateo sees Logan, crestfallen, as he
       and Izzie are zoomed one way and Albert and Cooper another!

       Zoey scrambles to her feet, pulls Mateo up. But before they
       have a chance to even catch their breath --

       SWOOSH! Their piece of hallway transforms into a circular
       SLIDE. They WHOOSH around and around and down to --

       THUD! Mateo, Z Blob, and Zoey sprawl to a stop on the floor
       of a vaulted cellar. The detritus of eons of Dream Keepers –
       chests, furniture, books, paintings – stacked everywhere.

       Zoey jumps up to investigate.

       hesitantly walks over to where Zoey is engrossed in pulling
       items out of a chest.

       Zoey scooches over, making room for Mateo to join him. Z Blob
       flashes Mateo a grin. Off Zoey and Mateo searching together --

       Albert and Coop rifle through shelves stuffed with books and
       old-fashioned glass bottles full of mysterious colorful
       liquids and preserved strange-looking creatures.

       But uh-oh, they’re so focused, they don’t notice a glimpse of
       TAWNY FUR pass by the open door. Albert cocks his head at a
       faint rustle of wings.

       accidentally swipes a glass bottle off the shelf. Catches it
       before it hits the ground.

       zooms through the air and hits Albert, who turns to crystal!

       turns to crystal, he drops the bottle...

       It SHATTERS against the floor... the eerie wails of SIREN’S
       SONG fill the air.

       Off Cooper’s face, frozen in terror, we CUT TO --

       Logan flinches as Izzie plucks the tiara off the bust,
       ignoring him. Nothing happens. She flashes him a cocky grin.

                  an all-powerful Dream Keeper?

97                          LOGAN                                    97
                      (taken aback)
                  What? No, it’s logical.

        Izzie swings around, startling Logan. She takes him by the
        shoulders and shakes him.

98                          IZZIE                                    98
                  Forget logic! Follow your heart.

        Too late, Izzie realizes what she’s said. Logan deflates.

99                          LOGAN                                    99
                  Yeah, tried that. Now Zoey hates
                  me.

                  She doesn’t hate you.
                      (off Logan’s hope)
                  Dislike you strongly? Yeah. But
                  hey, that’s not hate.

        Logan sighs exasperated and stomps off down the hallway. As
        Izzie hurries to catch up, CUT TO --

        CRASH! Mateo and Z Blob are startled from their searching by
        a plate smashing against the wall. They look over to Zoey,
        fists clenched, clearly pissed off.

                  Ugh. There’s nothing here! It’s
                  just a bunch of junk.

        Zoey holds up another plate. Looks ready to hurl it against
        the wall. Mateo rushes to stop her.

                  Whoa, whoa. Evil manticore-thing
                  hunting us, remember?

        Zoey puts down the plate.

103                         MATEO (CONT'D)                       103
                  C’mon, maybe the others have had
                  better luck.

        A thunderous ROAR freezes them in place. Scared. No way out.

                      (sotto)
                  Quick, hide!

        Zoey gestures to a stack of large paintings leaning against
        the wall. There’s a small space behind them. Zoey, Mateo, and
        Z Blob dive for cover as --

        SCREEEEEECH! CLAWS scrape against a wall...

        Our trio huddle close... the scraping sound gets closer...
        Zoey clasps Mateo’s hand...

        He glances down. Terrified but ecstatic. He squeezes Zoey’s
        hand, she squeezes back. It’s dangerous and romantic.

        The clicking of CLAWED FEET pauses in front of their hiding
        place. Our trio tense... fearing the worst --

        WHOOSH! The sound of wings flapping away. Whew! A beat. Then
        Mateo, Zoey, and Z Blob emerge, relieved. Mateo and Zoey’s
        hands are still intertwined.

105                         MATEO                                105
                      (with a ragged breath)
                  That was a little too close.

        Zoey lets go of Mateo’s hand.

                  W-w-what?

        Zoey gestures to a portrait they were just hiding behind --
        an idealized representation of the platonic love shared by
        LUNA and MIGO. Luna gazes wistfully at Migo, who looks up at
        her sweetly. (It’s done in the dreamy, art nouveau style of
        Alphonse Mucha.)

                  That’s an incredibly depressing

        Logan and Izzie step inside a round room -- shadowed and
        dark. Izzie stops in her tracks and stares upwards, awed.
        Logan takes in the room quickly, turns on his heel to leave.

                  I did. No books. Not a library.

        Izzie grabs his arm and points upwards.

                  Logan, look!

        Logan tilts his head back. Gapes at an incredible sight --

        The rotunda’s domed ceiling is constructed of gorgeous, multi-
        colored STAINED-GLASS WINDOWS in the same dreamy style that
        we saw in the painting of Luna and Migo.

        [Note: The windows are dusty on the inside and obscured by
        THICK VINES covering the outside of the dome. Barely any
        light streams in through the glass.]

                  I have GOT to get a closer look.

        Izzie darts over to a rickety staircase... starts climbing...
        reaches a narrow walkway around the base of the dome.

                      (calls over her shoulder)
                  I heard that.

        Izzie wipes at a spot of dirt on the inside of one window.
        Through the glass she suddenly spots --

        A LEONINE EYE peering back at her. She gasps and flails
        backwards, startled.

        Izzie races down the stairs to join Logan. But when they turn
        towards the door --

        RAAAGH!! The MANTICORE blocks their exit. And he’s a sight to
        behold! The head and mane of a lion. The torso of a man.
        Iridescent wings. He’d be stunning if his tail wasn’t
        flicking ominously -- razor sharp porcupine quills glinting.

        A beat. Then all hell breaks loose. The manticore SNARLS.
        Whips his tail around...

        Izzie dives out of the way. Logan POPS into his tiny blue
        BEAST MODE and shrinks in size. WHOOSH! The quills barely
        pass over his head!

        Izzie whips out her hourglass, begins to dreamcraft... the
        sand swirls into a giant ANIME-STYLE SWORD!

        Izzie grits her teeth, hefts her sword, and charges! The
        manticore releases another flurry of quills... Izzie whacks
        the projectiles off-course like a badass martial arts master.

        Lo-Lo breaks for the door as the manticore releases a fresh
        onslaught of quills. Izzie’s sword is a blur... she keeps
        advancing... until --

        SHUNK! A quill pierces Izzie’s shoulder. She stares at it,
        disbelieving --

        manticore inches away. The manticore picks Lo-Lo up in his
        claws... hurls him across the room!

        attention. The manticore flicks his tail... quills THWICK
        straight for them!

        Zoey flips out of the way. Logan dives behind a chair. THUNK!
        THUNK! THUNK! Peers out to see a line of razor sharp quills
        embedded in the chair.

        On Mateo. He whips out his HOURGLASS and turns to Z Blob...

        The manticore whips around to face them. GROWLS. Inches from

        Zoey races towards the manticore, dragging her sword along

        It’s easy to see why Mateo and Logan are in love -- we’re all
        a little bit in love with Zoey. She slashes and feints, her
        sword is a blur... but the manticore parries her every move

                  Too late.

        The manticore flicks his tail... a quill flies straight for
        Zoey... Logan leaps and... SHUNK! Logan drops to the ground,
        crystallized. Zoey’s face crumples in anguish.

        As Zoey reacts to Logan getting turned into crystal, ANGLE ON
        Mateo as he realizes -- Logan is the one Zoey likes.

        But there’s no time to dwell on it. Mateo dreamcrafts a
        barrage of arrows. THWICK! THWICK! They bounce harmlessly off
        the manticore’s tough hide! And then --

        SNAP! The manticore cracks his tail like a whip firing quills
        like arrows. SHUNK! SHUNK! Mateo and Z Blob are turned to
        crystal!

        The manticore turns on Zoey -- last woman standing -- she
        brandishes her CLOCK. But before she can wind time --

                  Enough! Prove you are a worthy
                  dreamer or be trapped
                  forevermore...

        The manticore SNAPS open his wings, transitioning us to...

        TEMPTATION SEQUENCE

        Zoey’s startled to find herself in a crystal cave (think
        Fortress of Solitude meets funhouse Hall of Mirrors). Cold.
        Disconcerting. Zoey stares at her reflection, which morphs
        into the manticore. He is everywhere and nowhere, cajoling.

145                         MANTICORE (CONT'D)                      145
                  I can see into your heart. I know

                  Tsk, tsk. We both know that’s not
                  true. I sense a deep loneliness in
                  you, Zoey.

        That lands. Zoey flinches.

                  You said it. Not me.

        The manticore is suddenly next to Zoey. He curls a wing
        around her, persuasive.

156                         MANTICORE                              156

                  All you have to do is ask.

        The manticore gestures to where we see a silhouetted image of
        a young Zoey holding hands with her parents. Zoey wavers,
        clearly torn.

        Zoey closes her eyes. We FLASH to: Zion nuzzling her; Izzie
        hugging her; Cooper high-fiving her, Mateo huddling with her
        behind the painting; and finally, Logan leaping in front of
        her. She squares her shoulders and opens her eyes.

        With a SNAP of the manticore’s wings, we transition back to:


17      INT. CASTLE NOCTURNA - GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS               17

        The manticore gets in Zoey’s face. Menacing. Opens his mouth
        to flash his fangs. Zoey tenses, anticipating the worst...

159                         MANTICORE                               159
                  That. Was. AWESOME!!

        The manticore breaks into a HUGE GRIN. CLAPS his hands twice.
        Air horn blasts. An explosion of CONFETTI. Zoey’s jaw drops
        and she splutters as confetti rains down from the sky.

160                         ZOEY                                    160
                  W-w-what the heck?

        The manticore holds up his paw as if to say wait a sec. He
        pulls a small voice modulator DEVICE off his neck. Crushes
        it. Grins. Says in a much friendlier, higher-pitched voice:

161                         MANTICORE                               161

                  I have someone to talk to again!!

        The manticore envelopes Zoey in a hug! She stares, dumb-
        founded as KRAAAK! The crystal encasing Mateo, Logan, Oz, and
        Z Blob breaks apart. It’s their turn to stare, stunned.

        Zion shakes himself, sending crystals TWINKLING to the
        ground. Spotting the manticore, Zion growls and charges!

164                         ZOEY                                    164
                  Zion, wait! He’s okay!

        Zion slams to a stop. To everyone’s amazement, the manticore
        scratches Zion -- and he actually likes it! Zion flops onto
        his back for a belly rub.

        That unlikely sight greets Albert, Cooper, and Izzie, who
        race in, looking for a fight. Come up short at the scene.

        enthusiastically shaking hands.

        The manticore shakes Z Blob’s hand so exuberantly it sends Z

        fizzles without a spark. Oz claps him on the back.

        ANGLE ON Mateo. He clocks Zoey sneaking a glance at Logan
        standing off to the side. Mateo sidles over to have a quiet
        conversation with Zoey.

                  That’s not going to change if you

        Zoey and Mateo exchange a smile -- it’s not romance but it is
        friendship and for now, it’s good enough.

        beside him. She bumps his shoulder, playfully.

        OVER! It rotates to reveal...

        A beautiful, crystal DAIS decorated with STARS and MOONS.
        Atop the dais rests a gorgeous, grand THRONE. Befitting a
        ruler of the Dream World. Our team lets out a startled GASP.

        Oz picks up Luna’s Hourglass. Gestures to an HOURGLASS shaped
        INDENTATION in the throne.

                  Luna once told me about her
                  failsafe. All that’s left is to
                  slot her Hourglass in and bring the
                  castle back online.

        Oz holds the hourglass out to Mateo.

                  Care to do the honors?

        Mateo looks around at his friends. The fact they’ve gotten
        this far a testament to their strength as a team.

                  How ‘bout we all do the honors?

        Oz passes Mateo Luna’s Hourglass. The kids approach her
        throne. Mateo slots the hourglass in. Together, Mateo, Izzie,
        Cooper, Zoey, and Logan rotate the hourglass 180 degrees...

        As the sand starts to drain, a BEAM OF LIGHT shoots up from
        the top of the hourglass!! Our team stares in awe. CUT TO --


18      EXT. CASTLE NOCTURNA - DAY - CONTINUOUS                      18

        The beam of light blazes brightly penetrating the grey dream
        ether all around the castle. As the light hits the clouds,
        they dissipate until the sun shines brightly on Castle
        Nocturna slowly coming back to life!

        Vines recede, dirt disappears, the dingy walls regain their
        luster until...

        We finally get to see Castle Nocturna in all its glory. It’s
        a translucent, iridescent crystal fairy tale castle!

        The sound of CHEERS erupts as we CUT TO --


19      INT. CASTLE NOCTURNA - GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS               19

        The interior of the Great Hall is transformed. It glitters
        and glistens. Gold and white pristine banners hang from the
        ceiling. Our team gazes in wonder. The Dreamlings shake free
        from their crystal prisons.

        Phil ROARS his approval, letting loose a blast of FLAME that
        forces everyone to dive for cover!

                  Oopsies.

        As our team pick themselves up, the Dreamlings chitter
        excitedly and dog-pile Phil. Izzie excitedly joins the fray.

192                         IZZIE                                192
                  So, Phil? Any awesome snacks up in
                  heahhhh?

193                         MANTICORE                            193
                  Of course! Why I could tell you
                  about legions of incredible meals
                  served at that very banquet table.

194                         IZZIE                                194
                  Oooh, do tell.

        Izzie leans in, all ears. But Albert clears his throat and
        steps forward, serious.

195                         ALBERT                                 195
                  I hate to break up this cozy scene,
                  but we need to find Luna’s book.

196                         MR. OZ                                 196
                  Albert’s right. The sooner we
                  discover the key to defeating the
                  Nightmare King, the better.

        Izzie grins, excited to drop a bombshell.

197                         IZZIE                                  197
                  What if I told you the book isn’t
                  actually a book?

        Off her cryptic announcement, we PUSH IN on Logan’s HAT where
        -- unbeknownst to our team -- the Nightmare King’s EYE
        TRACKER blinks ominously.

                                                          CUT TO:


20      INT. SHADOWKEEP – GRIM REALM (DREAM WORLD) – CONTINUOUS     20

        As the DARK ARCHER looks on, the NIGHTMARE KING projects an
        image from his staff:

        Our team... gathered together in Castle Nocturna...

                  They’re closer than we thought.

199                         NIGHTMARE KING                         199
                  No matter. Tonight, we destroy
                  Castle Nocturna once and for all!!

        As the DARK ARMY lets out an unholy cheer, we CUT TO BLACK...
