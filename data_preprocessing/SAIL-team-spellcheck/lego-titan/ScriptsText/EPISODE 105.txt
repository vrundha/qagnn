      Logan looks over at Mateo, a newfound glimmer of respect          *

      He raises off the blocks, bolts off the line again, races for     *
      the hurdle and --                                                 *

      find Logan reaching down to help him up.                          *

      Mateo takes it cautiously and gets to his feet.                   *
