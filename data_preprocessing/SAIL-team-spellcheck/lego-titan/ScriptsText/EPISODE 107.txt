      Oz and Albert rejoin the team. The dreamers scattered around
      the lobby begin to wake in their individual swarms of dream
      ether, returning to the Waking World with smiles on their
      faces after having quite the epic cyber fight dream.

                Thank you, loyal Dream Chasers, for
                your heroic endeavors! I hope we
                never meet again!

                What the Guardian is trying to say
                is that if he returns, it’s because

                the realm is under attack, so he
                hopes it doesn’t come to that
                again.

                I’m really sorry that you’ll have
                to return to your post. Must get

                I am never alone. Dreamers return
                to the Cyber Realm every night, and

                I get to witness them overcome the
                most challenging obstacles. It’s
                quite rewarding.

                time to watch the compilations
                first. You kids get started while
                Albert and I finish some business
                of our own.

                Why don’t you start from 1988?

                Good idea, bearded ape companion!
                Start with the longest one.

      The kids wince as they gather around Burrzerker bringing up a
      holographic image of a crude 8bit fighter game, starring
      himself. And we FADE TO --

      As the enemy soldiers retreat, we see Lance land on the deck
      of Sharkface Airship. He transforms, revealing himself to be
      the Nightmare King again. Dark Archer kneels as the Nightmare
      King walks by him.
