              D1 9.15.21
    INT. SHADOWKEEP - THRONE ROOM - DAY
    The NIGHTMARE KING gazes through the headpiece of his
    staff... spying on LOGAN and the DREAM CHASERS through
    the hat as SNEAK, SNIVEL and SUSAN bicker in the
    background.
1                          NIGHTMARE KING                       1
              Quiet, you fools! I’m trying to hear what
              the Dream Chasers’ next move is...
    The Nightmare King peers closer. We ZOOM IN ON THE POV --

    INT. CITY MIDDLE - CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS
2                          MS. PUTNAM (O.S.)                    2
              Next!
    LOGAN takes the stage in the cafeteria. A banner
    decorated with Halloween imagery behind him reads - FALL
    CARNIVAL AUDITIONS.
    MS. PUTNAM, the LIBRARIAN, and COACH JEFFREYS stand
    expectantly with clipboards in hand. When Coach looks up
    to see Logan, he smirks.
3                          COACH JEFFREYS                       3
              Time out... you’re auditioning for the
              carnival main stage?!
4                          LOGAN                                4
              Can’t have a block party without some
              sick beats, Coach...
                     (plugs in his phone)
              Now, get ready to have your faces melted
              by the musical mastery of DJ LOGANATOR!
    Logan picks up the microphone. Hits play on his phone --
    CROSS CUT THE SHADOWKEEP -- Teeth-clenching EDM beats
    BOOM out of the Nightmare King’s staff! We hear Logan
    improvising lyrics and noises...
    The Nightmare King painfully grabs his ears! SNEAK,
    SNIVEL and SUSAN can't help but dance a little as we --

    INT. CITY MIDDLE - HALLWAY - DAY
    Logan’s “music” THUDS out from behind the closed
    cafeteria doors. WIDEN OUT TO REVEAL -- Mateo and Cooper
    exchanging skeptical looks as they wait in the hall.
5                          COOPER                               5
                     (shrugs)
              Hey man, everyone’s gotta have dreams...
                                                                 2.

     A LOCKER SLAM causes Mateo to glance over and see ZOEY
     hastily gathering her books.
6                           MATEO                                6
               You gonna audition?
7                           ZOEY                                 7
               Do I look like someone who auditions?
8                           IZZIE (O.S.)                         8
               You look like someone who--
     Zoey pivots to glare at Izzie as she comes bounding up.
9                           ZOEY                                 9
               Don’t.
     Izzie’s mouth hangs open. She WANTS to continue that
     thought. The look on Zoey’s face convinces her otherwise.
     Logan bursts out of the cafeteria door.
10                          LOGAN                                10
               Totally nailed it.
     Coach Jeffreys emerges right after. Still wincing and
     rubbing his ears.
11                          COACH JEFFREYS                       11
               I wouldn’t hold your breath, champ.
                      (looks to the others)
               Anybody else wanna audition?
     Mateo glares at Zoey. She shakes her head.
12                          ZOEY                                 12
               Look, just because some people want to
               share their dreams with the world,
               doesn’t mean everyone wants to. You of
               all people should know...
     As Mateo watches Zoey head out, he catches sight of his
     own comic artwork adorning the CARNIVAL POSTERS.
     Coach Jeffreys shrugs. Heads back inside the cafeteria.
13                          LOGAN                                13
               Don’t sweat it guys. I’ll practice my
               skills tonight. Show Coach I can DJ with
               the best of them.
14                          MR. OZ (O.S.)                        14
               No time for extracurricular shenanigans,
               gang...
     The kids turn to see Oz arrive in a bluster. Arms full of
     papers.
                                                                3.

15                          MR. OZ (CONT’D)                     15
               Tonight we’re finally tracking down the
               Sandman... Meet me at the Landing, and
               don’t be late! I’ll explain everything...
     As Oz shuffles off, the kids turn to each other. Logan
     looks bummed.
16                          LOGAN                               16
               You guys ever think about going back to
               having normal dreams? Like, just being a
               regular kid again?
17                          COOPER                              17
               What, and forget about being Dream
               Chasers?
18                          MATEO                               18
               Look, we just gotta fix the hourglass and
               put a stop to the Nightmare King. We’re
               so close! Now that Mr. Oz knows where the
               Sandman is, I bet it’s gonna be smooth
               sailing from here on out...
     Mateo smiles reassuringly as we SMASH CUT TO --

     INT. OZ’S SHIP (DREAM WORLD) - DAY
     ALARM BELLS WAIL! Sparks fly. OZ and ALBERT man the
     controls, blasting away at the --
     SHARKFACE AIRSHIP pursuing them as NIGHT TERRORS streak
     out towards the ship...
     IN THE CABIN -- MATEO, IZZIE, COOP, LOGAN and ZOEY brace
     themselves.
19                          IZZIE                               19
               Is this your idea of smooth sailing?!
20                          MATEO                               20
               How did they find us so quickly?!
     We see the HAT on Logan’s head. He YELPS as Albert
     punches the thrusters... Diving...
21                          ALBERT                              21
               Hang on!
22                          LOGAN                               22
               Bro, where the heck are we headed?!
23                          MR. OZ                              23
               The Murky Realm!
                                                                 4.

24                            ZOEY                               24
               The where?!
     The ship shudders as Oz blasts a few more Night Terrors.
25                          MR. OZ                               25
               With Zoey’s help, I was able to decipher
               the musical clue from our dearly departed
               friend Jim the Yeti. I realized it was a
               SIREN SONG... only sung by the fabled
               sirens of the Murky Realm. It must be the
               location of the Sandman’s Tower!
     AHEAD -- the kids see the vibrant edges of the Dream
     World disappear in a pea soup-like fog.
26                          ALBERT                               26
               Good god man! Stop yammering and keep
               shooting! We’re surrounded!
     BOOM! The control panel sparks! The ship lurches! The
     gang SCREAMS! Logan grabs Izzie's hand. Realizes what he
     did. Screams again!
27                          MR. OZ                               27
               Too late! Brace yourselves!
     Mateo trades a worried look with his friends as the ship
     plummets and we CUT TO --

     INT/EXT. SHARKFACE AIRSHIP - SAME
     The unruly crew of NIGHTLINGS scramble about under the
     watchful eye of the NIGHT HUNTER.
28                          NIGHT HUNTER                         28
               C’mon you pathetic excuses for bad
               dreams! We’ve almost got them now!
     ON THE MAIN DECK -- The NIGHTMARE KING grips the railing.
     Peers out... His expression darkening.
29                          NIGHTMARE KING                       29
               Stop...
                      (louder)
               STOP I said!
     Unruly CREW hesitates.
30                          NIGHT HUNTER                         30
               Well come on then! You heard his Royal
               Scariness! Full stop!
     The crew scrambles over themselves to stop the ship as
     the Hunter approaches the Nightmare King.
                                                                 5.

31                          NIGHT HUNTER (CONT’D)                31
               Why are we stopping?
     The Nightmare King points... we see the fog of the Murky
     Realm ahead...

     EXT. MURKY REALM - DAY
     Oz’s ship plows through the murky atmosphere. Little
     floating islands emerging out of the fog... the ship
     barely avoiding them... engine cutting out before finally
     sputtering to a rough landing atop a swampy little island
     amidst an endless expanse of opaque grey...

     INT. OZ’S SHIP - MOMENTS LATER
     Dazed and shaken, the kids peer fearfully out at the
     foggy ether surrounding the ship.
32                          MATEO                                32
               Everyone okay?
     A few uneasy nods.
33                          COOPER                               33
               What are we supposed to do now?
     Albert enters the cabin from the rear compartment,
     coughing, wafting smoke away, covered in oil.
34                          ALBERT                               34
               Engines are spent, wing has been torn to
               pieces... hate to break it to y’all but
               we’re not doing anything til those get
               repaired.
35                          LOGAN                                35
                      (sarcastic)
               Got any more bad news?
     Oz turns from the instrument panel to face the kids.
36                          MR. OZ                               36
               The Nightmare King didn’t follow us...
37                          ZOEY                                 37
               Uhhh, that sounds like good news. What am
               I missing here?
38                          ALBERT                               38
               Young lady, legend has it the Murky Realm
               is where everything is forgotten and
               dreams go to die. So...
                                                                 6.

39                          MATEO                                39
               If the Nightmare King didn’t follow us,
               the legends must be true.
40                          IZZIE                                40
                      (sarcastic)
               Awesome...
41                           MR. OZ                              41
                      (realizing)
               Being forgotten is the one thing he
               fears...
                      (then)
               It’s a perfect place to hide really.
               Look...
     Oz points out the cockpit window...
     IN THE DISTANCE: The Sandman's tower. A rocky island
     reefed in fog, dunes of Dream Sand cascade off. The tower
     sits atop. A shining beacon in the gloom.
42                          MR. OZ (CONT’D)                      42
               Our best bet is to fix the ship and get
               to the tower before the Murky Realm
               exacts its inevitable toll and we begin
               to forget the very things that make us
               who we are...
     Oz turns to the kids and puts on a smile.
43                          MR. OZ (CONT’D)                      43
               Now, who wants to get out there and help
               with the repairs?

     EXT. SHARKFACE AIRSHIP - DAY
     The Nightmare King turns from the railing of the ship as
     the Night Hunter approaches.
44                          NIGHTMARE KING                       44
               Do you know what lurks in there?
45                          NIGHT HUNTER                         45
               I’ve-- I’ve heard the stories, Your
               Ghastliness... what would you like to do?
     The Nightmare King struggles to contain a manic fit of
     laughter.
46                          NIGHTMARE KING                       46
               What would I like to-- I’d like to cross
               into the Waking World! But I can’t
               because the Boy and his Blob have
               disappeared into the Murky Realm!
                      (grows sinister)
                            (MORE)
                                                                 7.

                            NIGHTMARE KING (CONT'D)
               My plans are now in jeopardy... Unless
               you find the Blob and bring him to me.
               Understood?
     The Night Hunter gazes out at the Murky Realm...

     INT/EXT. OZ’S SHIP - MURKY REALM - LATER
     Cooper tinkers with the damaged control panel while Logan
     grooves nearby, phone in hand, music blaring out...
     Mr. Oz storms out of the rear compartment.
47                          MR. OZ                               47
               Logan!! I’m trying to work here...
     Logan sulks. Pulls out his headphones and puts them on.
     Silencing the annoying music.
     Oz turns to help Cooper with the panel. Oz pauses his
     work, cocks his head --
48                          MR. OZ (CONT’D)                      48
               Logan! I said turn off that--
     Oz glares at Logan... who still has his headphones on.
     Rocking out. Totally oblivious.
49                          MR. OZ (CONT’D)                      49
               --music...
     Cooper notices too. Strains to listen... we hear a
     BEWITCHING MELODY echo out and CUT TO --
     OUTSIDE ON THE WING -- Albert works on repairing the
     damaged wing. He looks up to see Mateo, Z Blob, Izzie and
     Zoey gathered on the edge, looking out at the fog
     beyond...
50                          IZZIE                                50
               It’s so... Murky.
51                          ALBERT                               51
               No telling what’s out there so watch
               where you step - I don’t have time to
               babysit.
52                          ZOEY                                 52
               Then what are we doing out here?
53                          ALBERT                               53
               You’re supposed to be helping. Mateo,
               give me a wrench.
     Mateo backs away from the edge. Turns to Albert.
                                                                 8.

54                          MATEO                                54
               I... don’t have one.
     Albert frowns.
55                          ALBERT                               55
               Son, you’re a dang dreamcrafter.
56                          MATEO                                56
                      (chuckles)
               Right...
     Mateo reaches for his hourglass. Hesitates. Smile fading.
57                          IZZIE                                57
               What’s up brosephus?
58                          MATEO                                58
               I-- I can’t remember how to dreamcraft...
     Albert looks up from his work. Sees Mateo gazing out into
     the foggy ether. Albert's expression grows dark...
59                          ALBERT                               59
               The effects of the Murky Realm are taking
               hold... We need to hurry!
60                          ZOEY                                 60
               Albert, relax man. Just listen...
     Albert shoots a worried look over to --
     ZOEY AND IZZIE... gazing out into the fog. A far away
     look in their eyes as they strain to listen and we --
     CUT TO THE COCKPIT -- Logan, totally clueless as he jams
     out. Doesn't see --
     Coop and Oz drift to the door of the ship, totally
     transfixed. As they converge at the door, we SEE OMINOUS
     SHAPES dart past in the fog outside...
61                          COOPER                               61
               What are they?
62                          MR. OZ                               62
               I read about this, but now I... I can’t
               remember...
     Cooper opens the door to the ship, revealing --
     A MERMAID-LIKE CREATURE “swimming” in the fog and
     beckoning for them to follow. This is a SIREN.
     CROSS CUT TO THE WING -- As Mateo and Z Blob drift closer
     to the edge of the wing, transfixed by the same serene
     melody...
                                                                 9.

     Albert springs up and bounds across, but gets his foot
     stuck in a hole in the wing! He yells in frustration.
63                          ALBERT                               63
               Mateo!
     BACK IN THE COCKPIT -- Logan finally looks up to see Oz
     and Coop about to follow the siren into the fog. He yanks
     off his headphones --
64                          LOGAN                                64
               Yo! Where do you think you’re--
     But the siren song reaches his ears. Instantly
     transfixing him too.
     Logan drifts towards the door... headphone wire going
     taught... finally unplugging from the phone on his seat
     and --
     ANNOYING EDM BLARES OUT!! Overpowering the siren song.
     Startling everyone back to their senses. Oz and Coop
     immediately halt.
     BACK ON THE WING -- The EDM beats echo out... shattering
     the serene vibes. Everyone snaps out of their daze. Izzie
     shoots a look to Mateo and Z Blob but --
     They are teetering on the edge, about to fall and...
     Mateo steadies himself! Looks down into the fog to see
     the beautiful siren... which suddenly --
     LEAPS UP out of the fog AND SNATCHES Z BLOB!
65                          MATEO                                65
               Zeeee!
     Mateo doesn’t hesitate. Leaps into the fog, disappearing
     in the murk.
66                          IZZIE                                66
               We gotta go after my brother!
     Izzie pulls out her Bunchu plushie. Prepares to
     dreamcraft. But the determined look on her face vanishes.
67                          ALBERT                               67
               You all are forgetting. Forgetting what
               makes you Dream Chasers...
     Zoey grumbles. Then pushes past a stunned Izzie and dives
     into the fog after Mateo as we CUT TO --
                                                                 10.

     EXT. MURKY REALM - FOG - DAY
     Mateo leaps from one rocky island to another, enveloped
     in a dense fog. Desperately scanning the scraggly trees
     that loom up out of the murk like ghosts.
68                          MATEO                                68
               Zeee?! Z BLOB WHERE ARE YOU?
     He hears a strange SUCKING sound. Teo rushes past a stand
     of swamp trees to find --
     A CLEARING... And as the fog parts, he discovers a SIREN
     hunched over Z Blob... IT’S FEEDING ON HIM...
69                          MATEO (CONT’D)                       69
               Hey! Get your hands off my--
     But when the siren turns to face him, Mateo sees it has
     transformed into a HIDEOUS MONSTER with fangs and claws.
     Gulp... Mateo hesitates... then sees several OTHER
     HIDEOUS SIRENS emerge from the fog... surrounding him.
     Mateo stands his ground. Fear etched across his face...
     The Sirens poised to attack and --
     TIME SLOWS... and begins to rewind as ZOEY streaks
     through the murk, grabbing Mateo and Z Blob...
     TIME RESUMES... the sirens about to pounce, but Mateo and
     Z Blob are standing safely with Zoey.
70                          MATEO (CONT’D)                       70
               What do we do now?
     The sirens hiss at the kids! And begin to dart forward!
71                          ZOEY                                 71
                      (unslings her bow)
               Fight...
     FFWIIP! FFWIIP! Arrows streak through the fog. Taking out
     a few Sirens. Zoey’s skill on full display. Making the
     Sirens think twice.
     But she quickly runs out of arrows... The Sirens begin to
     rally... their BEWITCHING SONG filling the air.
     Mateo reaches for his hourglass. Fights the effects of
     the song. A daze creeping over him....
72                          MATEO                                72
               We... we gotta do something to overpower
               the siren song... Zoey...
73                          ZOEY                                 73
               I can’t...
                                                                 11.

74                          MATEO                                74
               Now’s not the time to be shy about your
               music! You gotta play something loud!
75                          ZOEY                                 75
               No, I mean I can’t remember how!

     EXT. OZ’S SHIP - MURKY REALM
     Oz gathers the other kids with Albert at the wing as they
     survey the fog. Logan’s music echoes out from his phone.
76                          ALBERT                               76
               Do we have to listen to that infernal
               racket?!
77                          MR. OZ                               77
               That infernal racket might be the one
               thing dispelling the siren song.
78                          LOGAN                                78
               Oh snap! See, Mr. Oz knows a banger when
               he hears one.
79                          MR. OZ                               79
               Albert, can you repair the ship on your
               own?
     Albert glances down to see the SHIP IS SLOWLY SINKING
     INTO THE MURK...
80                          ALBERT                               80
               Logan’s music may be able to hold off the
               Sirens, but it won’t delay the effects of
               the Murky Realm. If we don’t get out of
               here, there may not be a ship to repair.
81                          IZZIE                                81
               Then what the heck are we waiting for?!
               Let’s go!
     Oz nods solemnly at Albert. The gang prepares to
     disperse. Logan hands Albert his phone.
82                          ALBERT                               82
               Young man, I couldn’t-- wouldn’t want to
               deprive you of your, ah, sick beats.
     Logan whips out an old school BOOMBOX covered in
     stickers.
83                          LOGAN                                83
               S’all good bro. I always bring back up.
               It’s a DJ’s sworn duty to make sure the
               party don’t stop.
                            (MORE)
                                                               12.

                            LOGAN (CONT'D)
               Now, while we’re gone, you can listen to
               my hottest new track - Infernal Racket!
     Logan hits play. Leaves Albert grimacing as the group
     heads out, music blasting out of the boombox.

     EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND - DAY
     Mateo, Z Blob and Zoey flee blindly through the fog,
     leaping to a mist-shrouded island dotted with strange
     trees.
     He glances at Zoey who has a look of panic on her face.
84                          MATEO                              84
               It’s gonna be okay, we’ll find Oz’s ship--
85                          ZOEY                               85
               Teo, I’ve forgotten how to play! I’ve
               forgotten the thing that makes me, me...
86                          MATEO                              86
               Look, I know how much music means to you
               but right now--
87                          ZOEY                               87
               It’s not just about the music! You don’t
               understand...
88                          MATEO                              88
               I’m trying! But you don’t share anything
               with anybody! You don’t let anyone get
               close enough to understand--
89                          OLD BLIND LADY (O.S.)              89
               I understand, child...
     Zoey and Mateo pivot to see a LITTLE OLD BLIND LADY
     waddle out of the mist, carrying a lantern and cane. A
     hooded cloak casts her features in shadow.
90                          MATEO                              90
               Stay back! Who are you?!
91                          OLD BLIND LADY                     91
               Someone who can help... Come, quickly
               before the sirens get you. Or worse...
     Mateo trades a look with Z Blob. He shakes his little
     blob body. Doesn’t like the look of this new arrival.
92                          MATEO                              92
               Uhhh, no thanks lady. I think we’ll be
               going--
                                                                13.

93                          OLD BLIND LADY                      93
               Suit yourselves. But when you forget all
               the little pieces of yourself, don’t come
               crying to me.
     She turns and waddles off into the mist. The glow of her
     lantern receding in the murk.
     Zoey trades a look with Mateo and turns to follow. Teo
     grabs her.
94                          MATEO                               94
               What are you doing? We’ve got to get back
               to the ship!
95                           ZOEY                               95
               The Hunter took the song my mom used to
               sing to me and twisted it. Just to taunt
               me. The only thing I have left of her now
               is a dream where she...
                      (beat)
               Teo, I can feel myself forgetting that
               dream. I’m forgetting how to play. I’m
               forgetting all the little pieces of me.
     She looks at the retreating form of the Old Lady.
96                          ZOEY (CONT’D)                       96
               I’m not gonna let that happen.
     She heads into the murk. Mateo grapples with a decision.
     Glances back to see the ghostly forms of the SIRENS
     beginning to close in... and then chases after Zoey.
     As the Sirens converge and continue their pursuit --
     FFWIIP! FFWIIP! They are cut down in a hail of crossbow
     bolts...
     THE NIGHT HUNTER swoops down from one of the trees. He
     walks forward, scanning the murk. Then pauses...
     ON THE GROUND - a ring of DREAM RUNES, carved into
     stones, borders the mysterious island...

     EXT. SHARKFACE AIRSHIP - DAY
     The Nightmare King gazes at the runes through his
     staff... Susan approaches.
97                          SUSAN                               97
               The Hunter hesitates...
98                          NIGHTMARE KING                      98
               He is being cautious...
                                                                 14.

99                           SUSAN                               99
                Because he is weak.
      He gazes through the staff again...
100                          NIGHTMARE KING                      100
                Because there’s something worse than
                forgetting your dreams: Getting trapped
                in them...
      We linger on the image of the Dream Runes as we FADE TO --

      EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND - LATER
      We’re CLOSE ON the dream runes... WIDEN OUT TO REVEAL --
      OZ and the others emerging from the murk to stand before
      runes. Coop bends down to examine them.
101                          COOPER                              101
                Is this a warning? To keep people out?
102                          MR. OZ                              102
                I think this is here to keep something
                in.
      Logan sets the boombox down. Wipes a glob of Z Blob goo
      from the ground.
103                          LOGAN                               103
                Yo, they definitely came this way...
      Izzie bravely steps forward.
104                          IZZIE                               104
                Then let’s get this show on the road.

      EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND - DAY
      Zoey chases after the bobbing light from the Old Woman’s
      lantern as it retreats through the mists.
105                           MATEO (O.S.)                       105
                Zoey! Wait!
      She glances around the murky landscape, lost in the fog.
      Just silhouettes of scraggly trees around her.
      Then she hears it... the faint sound of a GUITAR... Zoey
      strains to listen... eyes going wide with recognition!
      Zoey takes off in the direction of the music.
      MOMENTS LATER -- Mateo and Z stumble through. No sign of
      Zoey...
                                                                  15.

106                          MATEO (CONT’D)                      106
                       (to Z on his shoulder)
                What do you think bud, where’d she go?
      Z Blob gestures... Mateo catches a glimpse of a light
      bobbing through the distant fog.

      EXT. MURKY REALM - WITCH’S CAMP - DAY
      Mateo stumbles through the fog and scraggly trees,
      emerging into a clearing where he finds a small fire
      burning... an iron cooking pot bubbling...
      And built into the surrounding trees, shelves upon
      shelves crammed with GLASS JARS AND BAUBLES... each one
      radiating with misty energy.
107                          OLD BLIND LADY (O.S.)               107
                Glad you decided to join me...
      Mateo pivots to find the Old Lady standing near the fire.
      Her hood comes off. He can finally see that she is blind.
108                          OLD BLIND LADY (CONT’D)             108
                I’m stuck on this island because of my...
                condition. So I don’t see many visitors.
109                          MATEO                               109
                Wait... you’re blind...
110                          OLD BLIND LADY                      110
                I still have ways to see what I want...
111                          MATEO                               111
                What did you do with my friend? Where’s
                Zoey?
      Mateo’s eyes keep darting to the radiant jars in the
      shelves all over the camp.
112                          OLD BLIND LADY                      112
                Come, look for yourself...

      EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND - DAY
      Zoey follows the sound of the GUITAR echoing through the
      mist... emerging from the fog to find another small
      clearing. A dead end. Nothing here.
113                          ZOEY                                113
                Where is that music coming from...
      She turns to double back, only to see THE HUNTER emerge
      from the fog and into the clearing. Tracking her.
                                                                  16.

114                          NIGHT HUNTER                        114
                You and your music...
      Her eyes narrow... doesn’t say anything. Just howls with
      anger and charges forward... Fighting the Hunter...
      manipulating time... battle raging all over the clearing.
      Even without her arrows, Zoey’s a force to be reckoned
      with. But the Hunter is better...
      He finally gets the upper hand. Has her dead to rights,
      crossbow aimed...
115                          ZOEY                                115
                Go ahead... what else are you gonna take
                from me?
116                          NIGHT HUNTER                        116
                That’s the thing with your generation:
                Thinking everything’s always about you.
      He lowers his crossbow.
117                          NIGHT HUNTER (CONT’D)               117
                I got news for you kid, I’m not here for
                you...
      Hunter leaves Zoey on the ground. Retreats into the fog.
      She growls. Springs up and is about to chase after when
      the little clearing ALIGHTS WITH A STRANGE GLOW...
      The sound of GUITAR grows louder. Zoey spins to see the
      clearing take on the murky appearance of a --
      PARK -- A hazy scene materializes before her eyes: a
      YOUNG MOTHER sits in the grass, playing guitar to a
      CHILD... Zoey’s jaw drops...
118                             ZOEY                             118
                Mom?
      Zoey steps forward into the ghostly fog-shrouded dream...

      EXT. MURKY REALM - WITCH’S CAMP - SAME
      ... as the Old Woman plucks a JAR from a shelf and it
      ALIGHTS WITH ZOEY’S DREAM INSIDE... Mateo gawks at it.
      Fascinated. Hears the melody faintly echo out.
119                          MATEO                               119
                Is that... Where did this come from?
120                          OLD BLIND LADY                      120
                Oh, let’s just say forgotten dreams have
                a way of winding up here... Look --
                                                                  17.

      The fog around Mateo swirls, taking on the appearance of--
      MATEO’S LIVING ROOM -- Faint and hazy... but Mateo
      immediately becomes transfixed by the sight of an ART SET
      and EASEL with a birthday bow on top and a YOUNGER
      MATEO...
      A festive banner reads: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MIJO.
      Mateo steps forward into the dreamy scene, merging with
      the younger version of himself.
121                          MATEO                               121
                I remember this... this was my first art
                set. This was the first time I drew--
      We watch Mateo draw a crude little Z BLOB...
      The real Z Blob grunts. Trying to get Mateo’s attention.
      Mateo just smiles serenely. Lost in the experience.
122                          MATEO (CONT’D)                      122
                Why are you hoarding these dreams?
123                          OLD BLIND LADY                      123
                Hoarding them? Goodness no, I’m
                protecting them! I prevent them from
                being forgotten by making them nostalgic.
                Comforting, even. Now you can revisit
                these memory dreams, time and time
                again... You’ll see why...
      Z Blob grows worried as Mateo falls under the spell of
      nostalgia.

      EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND
      Izzie bounds through the fog. Catches sight of a fleeting
      light.
124                          IZZIE                               124
                       (calling out)
                Guys! I see something ahead--
      She jogs forward, only to see the swirling fog begin to
      transform into --
      MATEO AND IZZIE’S BEDROOM -- Just impressions really...
      Hazy and faint, but Izzie immediately recognizes it.
125                           IZZIE (CONT’D)                     125
                My room...?
      On her bed is a plushie with a bow on it and a note.
                                                                  18.

126                          IZZIE (CONT’D)                      126
                Mr. SharkyJaw!
      She rushes over to it. Picks up the note.
127                          IZZIE (CONT’D)                      127
                OHMIGAW, I remember this... my mom got me
                SharkyJaw before my first dentist
                appointment. Because she couldn’t go with
                me. Every time I lost a baby tooth I put
                it inside...
                       (realizing something)
                Guys. This is a memory dream...
      She turns around but Oz, Logan and Cooper are not behind
      her. Just more disorienting fog.
128                          IZZIE (CONT’D)                      128
                Guys?
      She turns back to her memory dream and her expression
      darkens... THERE’S A SHADOWY FIGURE IN THE CORNER.
129                          IZZIE (CONT’D)                      129
                Mom...
130                          MYSTERIOUS WOMAN (O.S.)             130
                Do you like your present, Izzie? I’m
                sorry I couldn’t be there...
      The figure comes forward... a young MYSTERIOUS WOMAN. But
      there’s something unsettling about her.
131                          MYSTERIOUS WOMAN (CONT’D)           131
                But you can revisit this moment whenever
                you like. I promise I’ll always be here
                now...
      Izzie is shocked in place. Trying to process...
132                          IZZIE                               132
                No... this isn’t right. You... you aren’t
                my mom. You don’t belong in this dream!
      The smile on the Mysterious Woman’s face melts... as does
      her disguise... revealing THE OLD BLIND LADY.
      Izzie screams! Drops SharkyJaw! The hazy dream scene
      around her immediately dissolving back into fog.
      Izzie glances around... realizes she’s in the foggy
      clearing all alone again. She turns to leave and
      discovers CREEPY VINES have tried to grow around her
      legs.
      She kicks them loose and flees the foggy clearing.
                                                                  19.

      EXT. MURKY REALM - WITCH’S CAMP - SAME
      Mateo still smiles serenely as he draws Z Blob. He looks
      up from his work to see the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN cloaked in
      shadow, standing in the corner of the room watching.
133                          MYSTERIOUS WOMAN                    133
                You see... You can come here every night.
                Draw whatever you want. This is just for
                you. And no one else. Isn’t this nice?
134                          MATEO                               134
                Yes... wait, no. This isn’t right.
135                          MYSTERIOUS WOMAN                    135
                What do you mean, sweetie?
136                          MATEO                               136
                My mom always encouraged me to show my
                drawings... I almost forgot... but she
                wanted me to share my art. Not keep it to
                myself.
      Mateo stops drawing. The hazy dream begins to waver. The
      Mysterious Woman begins to waver too... her disguise
      falling away to reveal the Old Blind Lady scowling.
137                          OLD BLIND LADY                      137
                Fine! Have it your way!
      And the dream scene is DISPELLED... falling away to
      reveal Mateo and Z Blob standing back in the Witch’s
      Camp. The Old Blind Lady standing near the bubbling pot,
      still scowling.
138                          OLD BLIND LADY (CONT’D)             138
                But you’ll change your mind next time.
                You’ll see.
139                          MATEO                               139
                Lady, there isn’t gonna be a next time,
                I’m never coming back here!
140                          OLD BLIND LADY                      140
                Dear, you’re never going to leave...
      Mateo tries to move. Realizes he’s ensnared in swampy
      vines that have grown up around his legs... He reaches
      for his hourglass at his side, only to realize it’s --
      Across the room. Sitting on a shelf amidst the Old Lady’s
      jars and baubles. Mateo glares at the woman.
141                          MATEO                               141
                Why are you doing this?!
                                                                  20.

142                          NIGHT HUNTER (O.S.)                 142
                Because she’s trapped here...
      Everyone turns to see the Hunter slowly enter the camp.
143                          NIGHT HUNTER (CONT’D)               143
                Putting herself in these dreams is the
                only way she won’t be forgotten.
      The Old Lady growls.
144                          OLD BLIND LADY                      144
                You... you’re not welcome here!
145                          NIGHT HUNTER                        145
                Who’s gonna make me leave? You?
      She suddenly chuckles.
146                          OLD BLIND LADY                      146
                A few things have changed since last time
                we saw each other.
147                          NIGHT HUNTER                        147
                Last time we saw each other, you could
                still see...
      Z Blob notices the cauldron begin to bubble and boil. He
      hops up and peeks in to see --
      A PAIR OF EYEBALLS bubble to the surface of the murky
      concoction in the pot...
      Z Blob scrambles away from the cauldron as the witch's
      FAMILIAR crawls out of it - a huge WOLF-LIKE CREATURE
      that grows to full size, the cauldron becoming its collar
      as it --
      Lunges towards the Hunter!

      EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND - FOG - SAME
      Izzie races back through the fog. Nearly colliding with
      Logan who drops his boombox.
      Izzie screams! Logan screams! Oz and Cooper race up out
      of the fog, alarmed!
148                          MR. OZ                              148
                What is it? What’s wrong?
149                          IZZIE                               149
                We gotta get outta here! If we stay any
                longer, she’ll trap us in the dreams of
                our past.
                                                                  21.

150                          COOPER                              150
                What are you talking about? Who is “she?”
151                          IZZIE                               151
                I’ll explain later! We gotta find my
                brother and Zoey and get out of here!
                C’mon!
      As the group follows Izzie out, Logan picks up the
      boombox. Realizes it’s broken.
152                          LOGAN                               152
                Bro... my beats!

      EXT. MURKY REALM - WITCH’S CAMP - SAME
      Mateo struggles to free himself from the vines as the
      Wolf and Hunter battle it out.
      The Old Lady cackles, her familiar getting the advantage
      on the Hunter as his crossbow is knocked from his grip.
      As the Hunter struggles, Z Blob uses the distraction to
      STRETCH his blobby form out, towards Teo’s hourglass...
153                          OLD BLIND LADY                      153
                You and your Master always underestimated
                me... never came to my aid when those
                meddlesome Night Bureau agents imprisoned
                me... but now you’ll finally see...
      The Wolf looms over the unarmed Hunter...
154                          OLD BLIND LADY (CONT’D)             154
                Everyone made a huge mistake trying to
                forget about me...
      Z snaps the hourglass to Teo! It alights with energy as
      he dreamcrafts Z Blob into KNIGHT MODE!
      The Old Lady shrieks! Sir Z hacks at the vines, freeing
      Mateo!
      He stumbles back, colliding with a shelf of jars that
      fall to the ground. Mateo is about to run, when he
      notices one jar in particular --
      The one swirling with Zoey’s memory dream... The Old Lady
      yells out! The Wolf pivots and charges towards Mateo! He
      quickly doubles back and scoops up Zoey’s dream as --
      Sir Z punches the Wolf! Sending it flying into the
      Hunter! Both going down in a heap!
      Sir Z scoops up Mateo and they flee the Witch’s Camp as
      the Old Lady HOWLS in frustration!
                                                                  22.

      EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND - DAY
      As Izzie leads Oz and the others through the fog, she
      hears Zoey’s voice SINGING/HUMMING...
      Izzie quickly hones in on Zoey’s voice, the others
      following, stumbling into the --
      PARK SCENE -- where they find Zoey entranced by her
      memory dream. Humming along with the melody her mother is
      playing on the guitar.
155                          IZZIE                               155
                Zoey?!
      But she doesn’t respond. Doesn’t even take note of their
      presence.
156                          COOPER                              156
                Whoa, what happened...
      They see the vines have nearly grown up to her waist.
      Rooting her in place.
157                          IZZIE                               157
                See! This is what I was talking about!
158                          LOGAN                               158
                Bro, we gotta get her outta here...
      They converge on Zoey and struggle to break her free. But
      she’s absorbed in the memory dream. And the vines keep
      growing...
159                          MR. OZ                              159
                Zoey, listen to me! You have to focus...
                this isn’t real...
      The vines snake up Zoey, nearly consuming her as --
      MATEO AND SIR Z burst into the foggy dream! Z grabbing
      hold of Zoey’s outstretched hand and yanking her free!
      The hazy dream scene wavers and begins to dissolve into
      the fog. Zoey loses sight of her mom.
160                          MR. OZ (CONT’D)                     160
                We have to go!
161                          ZOEY                                161
                       (struggling to get free of Z)
                Mom! Noooo!
      The gang flees the fog. Zoey cradled in Z’s huge arms.
                                                                  23.

      EXT. MURKY REALM - SANDMAN’S TOWER - DAY
      The gang emerges from the fog. Exhausted. Z setting a
      shell-shocked Zoey to the ground as he morphs back to
      blob form.
      They catch their breath, take in their new surroundings:
      In the distance, a massive sand dune, and the SANDMAN'S
      TOWER siting at the top, dominating the horizon.
162                          MR. OZ                              162
                The Tower... we made it.
163                            COOPER                            163
                Mr. Oz...
      They turn to see a PACK OF SIRENS slowly gathering...
      blocking the path to the Tower in the distance. Their
      bewitching song begins to seep in...
      Weary and spent, the gang prepares to face yet another
      threat. Until --
      LOGAN’S AWFUL MUSIC cascades in from above...
164                          IZZIE                               164
                Wait, is that...
165                          LOGAN                               165
                My sick beats!
      ALBERT swoops in on Oz’s ship, blasting Logan music. The
      Sirens scatter as Albert lands the ship and disembarks.
      He marches up to Logan and thrusts the phone in his hand.
166                          ALBERT                              166
                Young man, if I never have to listen to
                your infernal racket again, it’ll be too
                soon.
      Mateo turns to Zoey.
167                            MATEO                             167
                You okay?
      She can’t answer. Z Blob tries to comfort her, but she
      starts to walk away. Mateo catches up.
168                            MATEO (CONT’D)                    168
                Hey... Zoey!
      She can’t look him in the eye.
                                                                  24.

169                          ZOEY                               169
                I lost it. The dream of my mom and the
                song she sang. I...
      He reaches in his pack.
170                          MATEO                              170
                I get it. I understand now why you were
                so hesitant to share your music.
      He hands her something. She looks down -- IT’S THE JAR
      WITH HER DREAM IN IT...
171                          MATEO (CONT’D)                     171
                Sometimes when something is that special
                to you, you just want to protect it.
      Zoey realizes what Mateo has given her. Looks at him...
      her face a mess of emotions. She hugs him, fiercely.
      Albert pulls Oz aside.
172                          ALBERT                             172
                What the heck happened in there?
173                          MR. OZ                             173
                Albert my friend, let’s just say I’ve got
                some research to do.
174                          LOGAN                              174
                Yo, Mr. Oz - what’s your research say
                about that?
      The gang all turns to see --
      Something moving through the sand towards them, beginning
      to take shape... finally rising up and forming like a
      shimmering golem...
175                          MR. OZ                             175
                That, at long last, is the Sandman.

      EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND - DAY
      Back at the island’s edge, the Hunter emerges from the
      fog, out of breath, damaged, and casting a scared look
      behind him --
      As THE WITCH and her WOLF are hot on his heels, barreling
      forward... He’s in for a world of hurt but --
      They come to a sudden stop at the DREAM RUNES carved in
      the ground...
      The Hunter laughs...
                                                                  25.

176                          NIGHT HUNTER                     176
                You might stay alive by putting yourself
                in those dreams... but you'll still be
                stuck here forever. I won't be
                responsible for freeing you.
      He shoots her one last smirk. Then retreats into the
      fog... The Witch looks at her familiar and chuckles.
177                          OLD BLIND LADY                   177
                Oh you won't be the one responsible for
                freeing me, dear...

      EXT. MURKY REALM - SANDMAN’S TOWER - DAY
      Oz and the gang stand before the Sandman. He’s looking at
      the broken hourglass through a jeweler’s eyepiece. The
      Sandman speaks with a kindly old man’s voice. (Think
      Billy Crystal)
178                          SANDMAN                          178
                Ehhh, here’s your problem right here.
                This thing is cracked! Really diminishes
                the value...
179                          IZZIE                            179
                Umm... Mr. The Sandman, sir?
180                          SANDMAN                          180
                It’s pronounced “SAN-muhn.” Mr. SAN-muhn.
      The gang trades a confused look.
181                          MR. OZ                           181
                Thing is, Mr. Sandman... we aren’t trying
                to sell it. We’re ah, trying to fix it.
182                          SANDMAN                          182
                Oy vey... Well... That’ll cost ya. One
                dream.
183                          MATEO                            183
                What?!
184                          SANDMAN                          184
                Everything has a cost. I need a dream.
185                          COOPER                           185
                Wh-- Well why can’t you just, I dunno,
                use the MOUNTAIN OF DREAM SAND over
                there?!
186                          SANDMAN                          186
                Bubbalah, that is not how this works.
                Look, people have dreams... the forgotten
                ones wash up here...
                             (MORE)
                                                                  26.

                             SANDMAN (CONT'D)
                I recycle them into the ether and they
                become new dreams... The cycle continues.
                Those are the rules.
187                          COOPER                             187
                Well... those are dumb rules!
188                          SANDMAN                            188
                Dreams aren’t meant to be bottled up
                inside. They can only truly live on if
                you share them with others...
189                          LOGAN                              189
                Bro. How are we supposed to bring you a
                dream?
190                          ZOEY                               190
                I know...
      Mateo watches Zoey step forward. A realization slamming
      home.
191                          MATEO                              191
                Wait, no - Zoey don’t do this to
                yourself.
192                          ZOEY                               192
                It’s okay. Really. Besides... this isn’t
                about me.
      Z Blob grunts his affection. She musters up her
      courage... And hands over the jar with her dream in it.
      The Sandman looks at it. Looks to her. Smiles kindly.
193                          SANDMAN                            193
                Now... let’s see about fixing this
                hourglass.
      The gang all gathers around to watch as the Sandman opens
      the jar. The ethereal contents begin to drift out into
      the air and they all watch Zoey’s Dream...
      As she scans the faces of her friends watching her mom
      play the song, Zoey smiles.
      But if we didn’t know better, we’d swear we heard the Old
      Blind Lady’s laughter echo out...
      FADE TO BLACK...
