1   INT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA (DREAM WORLD) – CRYSTAL HALL – DAY      1

    DIRECT PICKUP FROM Episode 116 “The Worthy Dreamer.” OPEN ON
    IZZIE, animated.
1                       IZZIE                                     1
              Think about it. Luna wouldn’t hide
              the story of how to defeat the
              Nightmare King in a book! This is
              the Dream World, people.

    Our team -- MR. OZ, ALBERT, MATEO, Z BLOB, ZOEY, LOGAN,
    COOPER, PHIL, ZIAN, and the DREAMLINGS -- considers this.
2                       ALBERT                                    2
              Point taken, Isabel. But if the
              story isn’t in a book, where is it?
3                       IZZIE                                     3
              Right there.

    With a sweep of her arm, Izzie gestures upwards to the
    gorgeous, impressionistic STAINED-GLASS WINDOWS above them.
    Sunlight streams in, refracted through the colorful glass.
4                       LOGAN                                     4
              Um, what am I missing?
5                       COOPER                                    5
                  (shrugs)
              Beats me.

    ANGLE ON Mateo, staring at the windows, thoughtfully. From
    his POV, we see... each window is comprised of different-
    sized PANELS (like a MANGA COMIC). Mateo suddenly grins.
6                       MATEO                                     6
              It’s like Bunchu and the Attack of
              the Killer Goo!
7                       IZZIE                                     7
              Yep. Volume 23.
8                       MATEO                                     8
              Genius, sis!
9                       IZZIE                                     9
                  (with a cocky grin)
              I know.

    Mateo rolls his eyes but tousles his sister’s hair lovingly.
    The others look on, confused.

                 One of you gonna tell us what’s up?
11                         IZZIE                                   11
                 Our favorite Bunchu Bunny manga is
                 a flip book. When you turn the
                 pages, the images animate.
12                         ZOEY                                    12
                 And that’s relevant because...?
13                         MATEO                                   13
                 What if the windows are sorta the
                 same? We don’t need to read Luna’s
                 story, we need to watch it!

       Our team looks doubtful, but Mr. Oz and Albert perk up.
14                         MR. OZ                                  14
                 I could see Luna obscuring the true
                 nature of the story to protect it
                 from the Nightmare King...
15                         ALBERT                                  15
                 And tying it to Castle Nocturnia so
                 only a Dreamchaser could find it.
16                         COOPER                                  16
                 Cool. So, how do we decipher a
                 story set in some windows?
17                         MATEO                                   17
                     (shrugs)
                 No idea.

       Everyone groans, except Logan, puzzling over one window.
18                         LOGAN                                   18
                 Hey Mr. Oz. Who’s that?

       He points to the one decipherable image in the FIRST STAINED-
       GLASS WINDOW: It’s MIGO, a sweet and adorable DREAM CREATURE.
19                         MR. OZ                                  19
                 That is Luna’s best friend, Migo.
                 From the moment she dreamcrafted
                 Migo, the two were inseparable.

       Seeing the similarities between the Luna/Migo bond and their
       own friendship, Mateo and Z Blob exchange a glance.
20                         ALBERT                                  20
                 Sadly, when Luna disappeared, Migo
                 did too.

21                         MATEO                                    21
                 I bet they’re together.

       Z Blob solemnly jiggles in agreement. Suddenly--

       BOOM! Loud, ominous THUNDER echoes around the room. For a
       beat, everyone freezes in fear.
22                         COOPER                                   22
                     (afraid)
                 Please tell me that wasn’t...

       Zoey hops astride Zian and flaps into the air. She stares out
       of the stained-glass windows.

       REVERSE to reveal... a NIGHTMARE STORM! Black, billowing
       clouds fill the sky. Zian touches back down.
23                         ZOEY                                     23
                 Yeah, it’s a Nightmare Storm. And
                 it’s approaching fast.
24                         PHIL                                     24
                     (ashen-faced)
                 If it reaches us, it will corrupt
                 the Castle!

       Our team instinctively huddles closer together.
25                         ALBERT                                   25
                 We hid our tracks. How’d this
                 happen?

       Teo can’t help it, he sneaks a look at Logan.
26                         LOGAN                                    26
                 Hey, don’t blame me! I didn’t give
                 away our location!

       On cue, the EYE TRACKER on Logan’s HAT BLINKS. Everyone
       gapes. Logan slumps, deflated.
27                         LOGAN (CONT'D)                           27
                 I did, didn’t I?

       Everyone nods as the NIGHT HUNTER’S smug visage swirls into
       view within the eye shape on Logan’s hat.
28                         NIGHT HUNTER                             28
                 Very astute, Logan. Only a
                 brainless Dreamchaser would fall
                 for such an obvious ploy...

       The Night Hunter winks out.

29                         IZZIE                                 29
                 I guess you could say he’s had his
                 eye on you for quite some time...

       Logan rips the hat from his head angrily, unsure what to do
       with it. Z Blob grabs the hat and swallows it! [Note: It
       dissolves to GREEN GOO as it hits his belly.]
30                         MR. OZ                                30
                 Well, that’s one way to destroy a
                 bugged hat.

       Clocking the glum, frightened faces of our team, Mateo steps
       forward.
31                         MATEO                                 31
                 What’s everyone so upset about?
                 This can work to our advantage!
32                         COOPER                                32
                     (unsure)
                 I don’t know, Teo...
33                         MATEO                                 33
                 No, this is good. If you guys can
                 keep the Nightmare Storm at bay, I
                 can decode Luna’s story. Then we
                 can all defeat the Nightmare King
                 together.
34                         ZOEY                                  34
                     (eyes narrowed)
                 If the Nightmare King’s itching for
                 a fight, he came to the right
                 place.
35                         IZZIE                                 35
                     (impressed)
                 Dang Zoey, you’re scary when you’re
                 pissed.

       Phil clears his throat and steps forward.
36                         PHIL                                  36
                 I may be able to help as well. You
                 see, in 1577, Dream Keeper Shin not
                 only installed indoor plumbing, he
                 had the foresight to--

                 What would you say if I told you
                 Castle Nocturnia has a powerful
                 light cannon?

       Logan fist-pumps.

                 I’d say hells yeahhh!

                 Dreamlings, find a place to hide.
                 Cooper, you and I will assist
                 Mateo. Everyone else, with Phil.

       As the Dreamlings scurry off and Izzie, Albert, Zoey, Logan
       and Phil race away, CUT TO:

2      EXT. SHARKYFACE AIRSHIP - DAY                                   2

       Hidden within the Nightmare Storm, the MR. SHARKYFACE AIRSHIP
       flies towards the Castle. The NIGHTMARE KING stands eerily
       still as NIGHTLINGS, including SUSAN, SNEAK, and SNIVEL, race
       to and fro aboard the airship.

       The Night Hunter slinks up alongside the Nightmare King.
41                          NIGHT HUNTER                           41
                 We’re almost in range, your
                 Scariness.

       The Nightmare King smiles malevolently.
42                         NIGHTMARE KING                          42
                 Today we show the Dreamchasers what
                 the Dark Army can do.

       The Nightlings let out an unholy CHEER and race to take up
       positions. Some notch BOWS with ARROWS; others load CANNONS.
       Linger on Sneak looking less than gung-ho as we CUT TO:

3      EXT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA (DREAM WORLD) – RAMPART – DAY             3

       Phil, Izzie, Albert, Logan, Zoey, and Zian spill out onto the
       Castle’s rampart, and stare in horror at the truly terrifying
       sight of the encroaching Nightmare Storm.
43                         ALBERT                                  43
                 We have to stop the storm before it
                 can corrupt the castle.

                 Where’s that light cannon, big guy?

       With a flourish, Phil whips a sheet off the LIGHT CANNON.

       But when Phil pulls on the cannon’s lever to fire the
       cannon... it won’t budge!
46                         PHIL                                     46
                 It’s stuck!

       Our team stares at the Nightmare Storm, rolling closer.

                 We need to hurry!

       Albert joins Phil and together, they try to tug on the lever.
       But try as they might, it doesn’t move an inch.

                 Brace yourselves!

       Izzie pulls out her hourglass and dreamcrafts her HAMMER. She
       swings it over her head...

       BOOSH! She brings the hammer down on the lever, which slams
       down and fires the cannon!

       BAWOOSH! Everyone momentarily shields their eyes as a
       blinding BLAST OF LIGHT blazes forth!

       ANGLE ON our team as they watch the continuous beam of light
       streak through the sky...

                 C’mon, please work...

       FATHOOM! The light beam SLAMs into the Nightmare Storm,
       freezing it in place! Phil and Albert high-five.

                 Yes! / Direct hit! / Boo-yah!

       OFF our heroes celebrating this success, we CUT TO:

       forth.

       As the light streaming through the windows hits the tile, it
       reflects into Mateo’s eyes. He looks up, intrigued, but his
       attention is drawn by a frustrated SIGH from Cooper.
51                         COOPER                                   51

                 posted ‘em.
54                          MR. OZ                                  54
                 But surely you must trust your
                 instincts.
55                         COOPER                                   55
                     (doubling-down)
                 No seriously, Mr. Oz. They have
                 everything online.
56                         MR. OZ                                   56
                     (deadpan)
                 I’m not sure this would be there.
57                         COOPER                                   57
                     (with a groan)
                 Which is why it’s totally
                 impossible without instructions!

       Mr. Oz looks like he’s going to argue but Teo interjects.
58                          MATEO                                   58
                 C’mon, Coop. Nothing’s impossible.
                 As long as we do it together.
                     (off Coop’s dubious look)
                 We can do this. You did figure out
                 how to unlock Luna’s Hourglass,
                 after all.

       Cooper suddenly straightens, struck by a thought.
59                         COOPER                                   59
                 Wait! The Hourglass!

       Oz, Teo and Z Blob exchange a confused glance as Cooper bends
       down to examine the floor. He searches around until...
     LEGO 09/28/21       "Assault on Castle Nocturnia"          8.

60                         COOPER (CONT'D)                       60
                 A-ha! I knew there was a reason
                 that pattern felt familiar!

       Cooper picks up Luna’s Hourglass and holds it above a TILE
       decorated with the same designs: FULL MOON, SUN, CRESCENT
       MOON, etc. He presses down on the middle of the tile and --

       THWUNK! The tile FLIPS OVER to reveal... a beautiful, crystal
       PEDESTAL! Oz and Teo let out a startled GASP as Cooper picks
       slots Luna’s Hourglass into an HOURGLASS shaped INDENTATION
       on the pedestal. Nothing happens.
61                         COOPER (CONT'D)                       61
                 Luna’s Hourglass must be the key!
                 It’s unlocked the rest of the
                 Castle’s secrets so far.

       Mateo looks thoughtfully from the light pouring through the
       windows to the Hourglass atop the pedestal and back.
62                         MATEO                                 62
                 What if there were a way to direct
                 the light from the stained-glass
                 windows through the Hourglass?
63                         MR. OZ/COOPER                         63
                 Huh? / Whaddaya mean?
64                         MATEO                                 64
                 Show ‘em, Z.

       Z Blob races over to move the tile he was playing with
       earlier back and forth. As it moves, it reflects the light
       shining through the stained-glass windows in different
       directions. (Think bouncing light off reflective shields to
       light the tomb in The Mummy). Cooper grins.
65                         COOPER                                65
                 Who needs instructions when they’ve
                 got us?

       Coop and Mateo high-five; it feels like old times.
66                         MR. OZ                                66
                 Excellent thinking, you two! Let’s
                 get these tiles into position.

       Mateo, Z Blob, Cooper, and Oz race around positioning the
       crystal tiles so that the light flowing through the FIRST
       STAINED-GLASS WINDOW bounces off different tiles until... it
       pierces Luna’s Hourglass! Suddenly...
     LEGO 09/28/21       "Assault on Castle Nocturnia"          9.


       WHOOSH! A translucent PEGASUS materializes and gallops
       straight for Cooper! He flinches, frozen in place and WHOOSH!
       The Pegasus passes right through him!
67                          MATEO                                67
                     (awed)
                 It’s a hologram.

       (Note: The sunlight streaming through the stained-glass
       windows is reflected off the crystal tiles and through the
       Hourglass thus creating a HOLOGRAM style projection that
       could look real or have a sepia tone to give it an aged feel.
       As the hologram plays, Oz, Mateo, and Cooper will
       narrate/connect the dots for our audience.)

       Oz, Mateo, Z Blob, and Cooper watch transfixed as a
       translucent LUNA materializes. She looks lonely.
68                         MR. OZ                                68
                 Luna... She looks so lonely.

       In the hologram, Luna dreamcrafts MIGO. She envelopes the
       sweet DREAM CREATURE in a hug. Together, Luna and Migo are
       happy. They play on the swings, they visit Dream Realms, they
       read, they share an ICE CREAM SUNDAE.
69                         MATEO                                 69
                 I’m glad she dreamcrafted Migo.

       Mateo smiles down at Z Blob –- the parallels between the two
       relationships apparent.
70                         MR. OZ                                70
                     (thoughtful)
                 I wonder why Luna included this...

       As if in answer to his question, Oz, Mateo, Z Blob, and
       Cooper are suddenly surprised to see Migo gesticulate angrily
       at Luna when she tries to leave him. He wants her to stay.
71                         COOPER                                71
                 Why’s he so upset?

       In the hologram, Luna tries to placate Migo but he’s
       inconsolable. Her face fills with regret.
72                         MATEO                                 72
                 He wanted all of Luna’s attention.

       Luna hugs Migo goodbye and he immediately throws a tantrum,
       screaming and pounding the floor.

73                         MR. OZ                                  73
                 I think Migo grew resentful of
                 Luna’s responsibilities as Dream
                 Keeper and her ability to go to the
                 Waking World.
74                         COOPER                                  74
                 What a baby. She couldn’t help that
                 she had to leave for a little bit.

       The hologram changes again -- this time, Migo waits until
       Luna falls asleep. Then he picks up her Hourglass and tries
       to dreamcraft... but nothing happens.
75                         MATEO                                   75
                     (surprised)
                 He’s trying to dreamcraft...

       In the hologram, Migo is frustrated by his inability to
       dreamcraft. He throws plates and cups at the wall, SMASHING
       them. He ROARS, enraged!

       Z Blob grabs Mateo’s hand as if to say –- that wouldn’t
       happen to us.

       In the hologram, Luna catches Migo YELLING at Dreamlings,
       scaring them. Luna scolds Migo and he sulks petulantly.
76                         MR. OZ                                  76
                 His frustrations and fears are
                 corrupting him.

       DARK SMOKE swirls within the hologram, making it feel ominous
       and unsettling. When the smoke clears, Luna turns fitfully in
       her sleep. Oz, Mateo, Z Blob and Cooper watch horrified as
       Migo invades Luna’s dream as a nightmare!
77                          MR. OZ (CONT'D)                        77
                     (shocked)
                 W-w-whaa--

       Luna wakes up, frightened to see Migo elongate and transform
       into... the Nightmare King!

       Oz, Mateo, Z Blob, and Cooper gasp, thunderstruck.
78                         MATEO                                   78
                     (astonished)
                 Luna created the Nightmare King.

       The Nightmare King, his eyes narrowed in anger at the steady
       beam of light holding the Nightmare Storm at bay. The Night
       Hunter lowers his CROSSBOW, approaches warily.
79                         NIGHT HUNTER                             79
                 I’m sorry, your Ghastliness. That

                 We’ll see about that...

       The Nightmare King strides to the bow of the ship and
       WHISTLES LOUDLY. A beat. And then...

       TWO NIGHT TERRORS fly out of the fog to hover by the ship.

       The Night Terrors SHRIEK with glee and disappear into the
       billowing clouds of the Nightmare Storm.

                 Which one is that? They’re both

       Phil heads for the other Night Terror. He SNAPS his tail and
       fires a light beam but the Night Terror swoops past him,
       making a beeline for the cannon! Logan spots it.

       The Night Terror reaches out its claws for the cannon...
       Logan POPS into LO-LO and leaps forward to grab the Night
       Terror by the tail! The Night Terror roars and shakes Lo-Lo
       off... sends him skidding across the rampart. The Night
       Terror advances on Lo-Lo, teeth snapping.

       She HURLS her HAMMER at the Night Terror and... WHOMP! It
       SLAMS into it, knocking the beast off the rampart as the
       hammer returns to Izzie’s hand of its own accord (think
       Thor’s hammer in Avengers). Albert and Lo-Lo gape.

       position beneath the SECOND STAINED-GLASS WINDOW.

                 How is knowing that the Nightmare
                 King used to be Migo supposed to
                 help us defeat him?

                 I think we have to activate each
                 window to get the whole story.

       They rotate all the tiles to beam the light streaming from
       the second window through the Hourglass. And then...

       WHOOSH! A hologram of Luna and Migo, looking determined,
       appears. Oz, Mateo, Z Blob and Cooper watch as Luna patiently
       tries teaching Migo how to dreamcraft. But each time he
       fails, he gets angrier.
95                         MATEO (CONT'D)                           95
                 She tried to teach him, but his
                 failures just made him mad.

       Luna encourages Migo to keep trying but he SNARLS at her and
       stalks off. Luna bows her head, despondent.
96                         MR. OZ                                   96
                 What Migo failed to grasp is
                 failure is an important part of the
                 process. Only through practice can
                 one expect to create something new.

       The hologram changes to reveal the Nightmare King siphoning
       imagination from a group of unaware dreamers! He uses this
       dark dream energy to dreamcraft a NIGHTLING!
97                         COOPER                                   97
                     (bitter)
                 Why learn to dreamcraft when you
                 can just steal kids’ imaginations?!

       The hologram shifts again. Astride her Pegasus, Luna watches
       on horrified as the Nightmare King and his Dark Army corrupt
       an entire realm!
98                         MR. OZ                                   98
                 This must be the moment Luna
                 decided she had to imprison him.

       As the hologram ends, Coop turns to the others, excited.

        Mateo hugs Z Blob and whips out the DREAMIE-SCREAMIES (Dream
        World Walkie-Talkies).
100                         MATEO                                 100
                  How’s it going out there?

                                                            CUT TO:

8       EXT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA – RAMPART – DAY                          8

        ON Zoey atop Zian, staying one step ahead of a Night Terror.
        She hears the SQUAWK of her Dreamie-Screamie and picks up.
101                         ZOEY                                  101
                  Kinda busy here, Teo.

        In the BG, Izzie, Lo-Lo, and Phil are still wrangling with
        the other Night Terror as Albert guards the cannon.
102                         MATEO                                 102
                  We’re almost done! The last stained-
                  glass window holds the key to
                  defeating the Nightmare King!
103                          ZOEY                                 103
                  Then watch it already. We could use
                  some help!

        Zoey ends the transmission and tucks the Dreamie-Screamie
        away. Eyeing the beam of light shooting from the cannon, Zoey
        gets an idea. She whispers something to Zian, who nods and
        dives for the beam.
104                           ZOEY (CONT'D)                       104
                  Easy...

        Zian slows down, allowing the Night Terror to gain on them.
        It’s almost on top of them when...
105                           ZOEY (CONT'D)                       105
                  NOW!

        Zoey agiley flips OVER THE BEAM as Zian FLIES UNDER IT! The
        Night Terror tries to change course, but can’t! It careens
        into the light beam and dissolves into DREAM ETHER! Zoey
        lands back on Zian with a grim smile.
106                         ZOEY (CONT'D)                         106
                  Nice work, Zian.

        ANGLE ON Izzie hurling her hammer at the other Night Terror.
        The hammer THWICKS through the air.
      LEGO 09/28/21       "Assault on Castle Nocturnia"          15.


        But the Night Terror zips out of the way and the hammer
        accidentally SLAMS into Lo-Lo! Oof! He’s knocked off his feet
        as Izzie winces.
107                         LO-LO                                   107
                  Ack! Watch it! That thing stings.
108                         IZZIE                                   108
                  Oopsies. Sorry, Lo-Lo!

        Lo-Lo dizzily stands.
109                         LOGAN                                   109
                  I told you not to call me that!
110                         IZZIE                                   110
                      (catching her hammer)
                  Whatever you say, Lo-Lo!

        Just then, BOOSH! The Night Terror swoops in, knocking
        Izzie’s hammer away! Uh-oh! It advances on Izzie, snarling.
        Albert and Logan race for her but are too far away...

        RAAGH! With a roar, Phil shoots a light beam at the Night
        Terror and SHUNK! The Night Terror turns to crystal!
111                         ALBERT                                  111
                  Nice shot, Phil!

        Phil flashes Albert a thumbs-up as Izzie holds up her hand a
        la Thor waiting for his hammer.
112                         IZZIE                                   112
                  This is NOT a drill people.

        Her hammer WHOOSHES back into Izzie’s hand. She grins and
        whips it around to SMASH the Night Terror into DREAM ETHER!

        Logan, Izzie, Albert and Phil WHOOP with delight as Zoey and
        Zian alight atop the rampart alongside them, victorious.

                                                          SMASH TO:

9       EXT. SHARKYFACE AIRSHIP - DAY                                  9

        The Nightmare King, HOWLING. He angrily FIRES a SHADOW BOLT
        from his staff, forcing Susan, Snivel and Sneak to dive for
        cover. The Night Hunter grimaces.
113                         NIGHTMARE KING                          113
                  I won’t be thwarted by an old man,

                  Your Scariness, a small contingent
                  could get around the light cannon.
                  Let me go in and get the little
                  green blob for you.

        The Nightmare King composes himself. Sneers.
115                         NIGHTMARE KING                          115
                  No, you’ve had more than enough
                  chances. It’s time I take care of
                  these Dreamchasers myself.

        The Nightmare King leaps astride his NIGHT MARE, who takes to
        the skies. As they fly off, he calls over his shoulder:
116                         NIGHTMARE KING (CONT'D)                 116
                  Prepare to attack!

        The Night Hunter slumps, a little crestfallen. Catches Susan,
        Sneak, and Snivel looking at him and lashes out.
117                         NIGHT HUNTER                            117
                  You heard him! Man your stations!

        As the Nightlings jump and scurry into position, CUT TO:

10      EXT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA – RAMPART – DAY                        10

        Our team is in a celebratory mood. But then, Albert catches
        sight of something zoom out of the stormclouds... he squints.
118                         ALBERT                                  118
                  What’s that?

        Our team whips around to see... the Nightmare King on his
        Night Mare! BOOSH! He fires a barrage of SHADOW BOLTS,
        forcing our heroes to scramble and dive for cover. And
        then...

        FATHWOOM! A SHADOW BOLT SMASHES into the light cannon,
        obliterating it! As debris rains down, the beam of light
        sputters out and our team stares in horror at...

        The Sharkyface ship, appearing out of the Nightmare Storm!

        OFF our heroes facing the approaching onslaught, CUT TO:

        The light from the final hologram flickers over Oz, Mateo, Z
        Blob, and Cooper.

        They watch reverently as Luna materializes at a desk,
        surrounded by crumpled papers covered in calculations. She
        looks frazzled and frightened.
119                         MATEO                                   119
                  She’s so scared.
120                         MR. OZ                                  120
                  Trying to figure out how to
                  imprison the Nightmare King took a
                  terrible toll on Luna...

        In the hologram, Luna picks up a picture of her and Migo in
        happier times. Sets it aside with a mournful smile.
121                         MR. OZ (CONT'D)                         121
                  Deep down, she still felt like he
                  was her dear friend.

        The hologram changes and we see Luna meet up with three
        figures, partially hidden by shadows. All three hold
        HOURGLASSES by their sides.
122                         COOPER                                  122
                  She had help from other
                  Dreamchasers!
123                         MATEO                                   123
                  Maybe that’s how she did it...

        A loud BOOM within the hologram makes our team jump. Luna and
        the Dreamchasers looks over their shoulders, fearful.
124                         MATEO (CONT'D)                          124
                  This is it.

        Mateo clutches Z Blob’s hand... the moment of truth...

        Luna steps alongside the three DREAMCHASERS. As they hold
        aloft their HOURGLASSES, ready to face down the Nightmare
        King, reveal... one of the Dreamchasers is Oz!
125                         COOPER                                  125
                  What the--?

        Mateo, Z Blob, and Cooper look over at Oz, shocked. They are
        so focused they don’t see...

        The Nightmare King surreptitiously sneak into the room! He
        stops in his tracks, shocked by the sight of Luna. Thinking
        for a second that she’s real, he reaches out his hand...

                  Luna...

        As his hand PASSES THROUGH the hologram, he lets out a
        frustrated GROWL that draws our team’s attention. Startled,
        Cooper bumps into one of the crystal tiles, halting the
        hologram. Mateo stares at the Nightmare King, aghast.
127                         MATEO                                127
                  How could you, Migo?
128                         NIGHTMARE KING                       128
                      (with a snarl)
                  No one calls me that!

        He whips his staff around...

        BAWOOSH! He fires a DREAMBOLT at the last stained-glass
        window, which EXPLODES and shatters against the floor! Before
        anyone can react, the Nightmare King swings his staff around
        and knocks Cooper off his feet.

        Oz fires his TELESCOPE RIFLE but the Nightmare King dodges –-
        faster than the eye can see. Mateo’s hourglass alights with
        energy as he dreamcrafts Z Blob into KNIGHT MODE!

        Our team dives for cover as the Night Hunter gives a signal
        and Nightlings fire the ship’s cannons! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

        SHADOW BOLTS THUD into the castle, shaking the rampart. Zoey
        on Zian and Phil take to the skies as everyone else picks
        themselves up, a little shaky.

        POPS into Lo-Lo, rolls himself into a ball, and BARRELS

        On the ship, the Night Hunter has Albert dead to rights,

        him... no escape... she yanks Zian around... WINDS HER
        CLOCK...

        THUD! The Night Hunter stares in confusion at the crossbow
        bolt stuck in the side of the castle and Albert cradled

        obviously tiring. Mateo and Cooper dreamcraft ARROWS. FFWIIP!
        FFWIIP! The Nightmare King has no trouble FLICKING them away!

        ANGLE ON Oz. He’s got a bead on the NK. Fires his rifle...

                  I’m out!

        Seeing that Oz is momentarily distracted, the Nightmare King
        spins his staff around... WHACK! Oz falls to the floor,
        knocked out! ON Cooper, noticing his sand is running low.

                  Leave him alone!

        The Nightmare King CACKLES and SHOOTS out a swirl of PURPLE
        AND BLACK DREAM ETHER that snakes around Cooper and Mateo,
        immobilizing them! They grunt, trying to break free.

                  Whatever it takes, we’re going to
                  stop you and protect the Dream
                  World!
144                         NIGHTMARE KING                       144
                      (with a smug chuckle)
                  Oh, Mateo. Who said anything about
                  the Dream World?

        To Mateo’s horror, the Nightmare King scoops Z Blob up and
        heads for the door!
145                         MATEO                                145
                  Z! NOOOOOOOOOOO!
      LEGO 09/28/21       "Assault on Castle Nocturnia"         21.


        Z’s eyes widen as he’s whisked out of the Castle! Desperate,
        Mateo fights free of the inky, black dream ether restraining
        him and yanks Cooper free. They rush to Oz’s side...
146                         COOPER                               146
                  I’ve got him! GO!!

        As Mateo races away, Coop helps a woozy Oz to his feet. He
        throws Oz’s arm over his shoulder.
147                         COOPER (CONT'D)                      147
                  Mr. Oz, you were there! Why don’t
                  you know how Luna defeated the
                  Nightmare King?
148                         MR. OZ                               148
                  We don’t have time for this,
                  Cooper! We need to get Luna’s
                  Hourglass and get out of here!

        They turn towards the Hourglass but then... BOOM! A section
        of wall SHATTERS, sending crystal shards raining down! Coop
        yanks Oz out of harm’s way but the Hourglass is buried in the
        rubble.
149                         COOPER                               149
                  Leave it! We have to go!

        They stumble for the door as we CUT TO:

14      EXT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA – GARDEN - CONTINUOUS                  14

        Mateo dodging falling shards of crystal as he zig-zags after
        the Nightmare King... BOOM! BOOM! The NK keeps blasting
        SHADOWBOLTS at Castle Nocturnia’s walls! Mateo locks eyes
        with a frightened Z Blob...
150                         MATEO                                150
                  Z! HOLD ON!

        Mateo closes the distance between him and the Nightmare King
        until... an ungodly BOOOOOM!

        Dust and debris fill the air, as parts of the castle fly in
        every direction! The force throws Mateo off his feet...

        As the dust settles, he scrambles up to see the Nightmare
        King leap astride his Night Mare and take to the skies. Mateo
        whips out his hourglass – he has the tiniest amount of sand
        left – but then...
151                         LOGAN (O.S.)                         151

      LEGO 09/28/21       "Assault on Castle Nocturnia"            22.


        Teo whips his head around... spots Logan dangling dangerously
        from a part of the rampart! He won’t be able to hold on much
        longer!

        Mateo whips his head from Z Blob to Logan and back -– faced
        with an impossible choice.

15      EXT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA – RAMPART – SAME                       15

        ON Logan scrabbling for purchase on the CRYSTAL SHARD...
        fingers slipping... he SCREAMS as he loses his grip and
        falls...

        THUD! To his surprise, he lands unharmed on something hard.

        ON Zoey, astride Zian. As she watches in awe, the crystal
        shards COME TOGETHER and form a STAIRCASE leading down!

        ON Izzie as she rushes to lean over the rampart’s edge... her
        mouth falls open... she’s stunned to see...
152                         IZZIE                                   152
                  Holy guacamole! How is this
                  possible?

        Zoey swoops by and points.
153                         ZOEY                                    153
                  It’s your brother! Look!

        REVEAL Mateo, focusing his attention on wielding the last bit
        of sand in his hourglass to dreamcraft a crystal staircase
        and save Logan! OFF his unwavering focus, CUT TO:

16      EXT. SHARKYFACE SHIP – SAME                                  16

        The Nightmare King lands the Night Mare aboard the ship and
        hands Z Blob over to the Night Hunter.
154                         NIGHTMARE KING                          154
                  Watch the blob with your life.
155                         NIGHT HUNTER                            155
                  Yes, your Frightfulness.

        The Nightmare King gazes at Teo, appraisingly.
156                          NIGHTMARE KING                         156
                  That one is stronger than I
                  thought...

        As the Sharkyface ship zips away, DISSOLVE TO:

17      EXT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA – GARDEN – SAME                       17

        Our team slumps sadly around the garden. Beaten and defeated.
        The Dreamlings huddle around Phil, who sheds big tears. Mateo
        sits apart, staring into space, despondent. Our team exchange
        a worried look –- unsure how to approach him.

        Izzie slowly stands and walks over to her brother. Her heart
        breaking at the grief etched on his face.
157                         IZZIE                                   157
                  I’m so sorry, Mateo.
158                         MATEO                                   158
                  I just want him back...

        Izzie wraps her arms around her distraught brother.
159                         IZZIE                                   159
                  He knows you love him.
160                         MATEO                                   160
                  I left him!
161                         IZZIE                                   161
                  You didn’t have a choice. You saved
                  Logan. Z Blob’s strong. He knows
                  we’re coming for him.

        Hearing that, the rest of the team clusters around Mateo.
162                         LOGAN                                   162
                  We’ll help you get Z Blob back.
163                         ZOEY                                    163
                  And we won’t rest until we do.
164                         MATEO                                   164
                  Yeah? How are we gonna do that? We
                  have no idea how to defeat the
                  Nightmare King.
165                         COOPER                                  165
                  Not yet we don’t.

        Cooper plunks down a SHARD OF STAINED-GLASS WINDOW.
166                         MR. OZ                                  166
                      (startled)
                  Is that a piece of the stained-
                  glass window?
      LEGO 09/28/21        "Assault on Castle Nocturnia"          24.

167                         COOPER                                 167
                  Yep. I found it in the ruins of the
                  Crystal Hall. Figure it could come
                  in handy... if we can find the
                  other pieces.
168                         IZZIE                                  168
                  We can. We will.
169                         ALBERT                                 169
                  That’d be one heck of a puzzle.
170                         MATEO                                  170
                  Forget it! There’s too many pieces.
                  We’ll never figure it out!

        Cooper cocks his head, remembering what Teo said to him
        earlier.
171                         COOPER                                 171
                  Yanno, as someone wise said to me
                  not long ago... Nothing’s
                  impossible. As long as we do it
                  together.

        Mateo glances up sharply, recognizing his own words. He sees
        his friends nodding, solemnly.

        Heartened by the resolve in their eyes, Mateo slowly rises to
        his feet.
172                         MATEO                                  172
                  Right then. I guess we got some
                  work to do.

        Off our heroes’ determined faces, we...

        FADE TO BLACK...
