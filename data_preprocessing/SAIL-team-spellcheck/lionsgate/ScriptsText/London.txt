Use your imagination, everything isn’t as it seems.


WHEN WE FIND OURSELVES ON AN AIRPLANE.


INT. AIRPLANE, TRANSCONTINENTAL FLIGHT - EVENING

And we see a WOMAN in her late thirties, a modern woman in
all the right respects, including combed and tailored, topped
by a distinctive red beret, somebody seemingly sure of
herself settling into her business class seat. But don’t be
misled by her tailoring, her sense of being so put together,
she has all the not-so-subtle fidgeting and mannerisms of a
charismatic neurotic. Somebody who has embraced her neuroses
as to have them become affectations of something she wears as
a uniqueness about her, “an artist,” although when stripped
naked of her success she is just another neurotic desperate
for the peace of control over her universe. But much more
about her to come...At this moment she is busily settling
into her seat, doing the little things people do to make
their seat, like the show “Alone,” building their shelter
from the storm, making the seat her sanctuary; putting up the
invisible shell from any potential seat-mates, intruders. In
short, making it for these next seven hours her home.

And like any good Hitchcock, or Billy Wilder movie, the first
thing we really hear is a MAN’S VOICE. Sunny, innocent
enough, even a little bit fumbling like a Cary Grant, that
begins our journey simply with:

                    A MAN’S VOICE (OVER)
          I think this is my seat.

She blinks away the fantasy that she would have the seat to
herself. And we see a MAN in his early forties wearing an
overcoat putting his book bag on the aisle seat next to hers.
A handsome rough hewn man who doesn’t smile very often, but
when he does it is earned and makes us want to know him.
Putting his rolling bag up...

                     THE MAN
              (a rare smile)
          I always forget, is it wheels out or
          wheels in?

She thinly smiles but doesn’t say anything as if fair warning
she won’t be spending much time talking with him. A Flight
Attendant asks if she can take his coat:
                                                         2.


                    THE MAN (CONT’D)
              (realizing)
          I never remember I have it on.
              (charming)
          I’m so used to it I could climb into
          bed and get under the covers still
          wearing it and sleep like a baby...

He surprises us with an appreciative ironic laugh, giving her
the coat...He sits down, getting settled, and tells the Woman
beside him, unabashed...

                    THE MAN (CONT’D)
          I was involved with a woman once, a
          doctor, she was so immersed in
          thinking about her work she would put
          her blouse on backwards.
              (that rare smile)
          You couldn’t tell if she was coming or
          going...

Despite herself, the Woman smiles.

                    THE MAN (CONT’D)
              (introducing himself)
          I’m Mackensie.

It’s hard to know if it’s his first or last name.

                    THE WOMAN
              (finding herself engaged)
          Do people call you Mac?

                    MACKENSIE
          Actually, “Doc.” I’m crazy about the
          movie “Marathon Man.” I’ve watched it
          like a hundred times... I know it
          pretty much word for word. Dustin
          Hoffman’s brother, played by Roy
          Scheider, was CIA, everything was a
          secret...I was eleven when I first saw
          it and I loved secrets. Still do I
          suppose. He was named Doc, it stuck.
          The villain was an old Nazi portrayed
          by Sir Laurence Olivier...he asks him,
          “Well...can I trust you?” Doc says,
          ”You never could. You only had to.”
          The old Nazi says, “We’re talking
          about my safety.” Doc answers him,
          “May I be candid?” The old Nazi nods
          yes...and Doc says, “I couldn’t give a
          fuck about you...!”
                                                         3.


Which has Mackensie and her laughing. In spite of himself,
she is charmed by him.

                    THE WOMAN
          I’m Joanna. My father was in love with
          Audrey Hepburn who was Joanna Wallace
          in “Two for the Road.” I think he
          hoped it would give me a sunny
          disposition. I’m not sure it worked
          out altogether...

Mackensie reaches, sweetly...

                    MACKENSIE
          Good to meet you, “Sunny.”

She smiles and shakes his hand. She settles back, the plane
starting to make its way to the runway.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
              (looking around)
          We would have never imagined shaking
          hands a year ago.

                    JOANNA
          Or taking an airplane.

                    MACKENSIE
          Or breathing again...Where were you?

                    JOANNA
          I have a place in Woodstock. The only
          people I saw were Amazon drivers, my
          gardener, pool man and one of my two
          children, Iris, waiting to go back to
          college. Which never came that year.
          Her boyfriend and her did exhaust the
          marijuana supply. You?

                    MACKENSIE
          I took a trip. I bought an RV, an old
          Airstream, and traveled from one park
          to another for the first six months.
          Do you know they have park hosts?

                    JOANNA
          I don’t camp much. We went glamping in
          the Tetons one time, stayed in yurts
          when the kids were small... cots with
          pedic mattresses and Sundance
          blankets, that’s as close as I get to
          sleeping on the ground.
                                                         4.


                    MACKENSIE
          The hosts get to live for free and
          take care of the campground. They are
          a step above homeless. An old rusted
          trailer, a dented red ATV and chopped
          wood they sell to campers in their
          yard. But it’s I suppose as close as
          you can get, when penniless, to being
          free. I sat one night with the hostess
          and her female partner. They seemed as
          happy as they could be.
              (a beat, without affect)
          I read last month how the hostess had
          been found stabbed to death in their
          trailer.

                       JOANNA
          Oh my God!

                    MACKENSIE
          They found her partner, the bloody
          knife beside her, sitting next to her
          lover’s body...and she said to the
          Forest Ranger... “I wish it were ten
          minutes ago...”

                    JOANNA
              (looks at him)
          That’s chilling.

                     MACKENSIE
              (cold)
          People can be chilling.

She looks at him, there is something else about him, that has
her instincts sense caution, but she lets it go...

The AIRPLANE is poised at the end of the runway, the engines
picking up speed sending them hurtling down the runway. He
sees she is nervously clenching her fist. He kindly puts his
hand over hers to alleviate the anxiety...She grimaces a
smile of appreciation...He moves his hand as quickly as he
put it there not to appear forward...They safely take
off...She exhales...

                    JOANNA
          I never believe it will actually get
          into the air...and stay there...It
          takes a good deal of magical
          thinking...

                    MACKENSIE
          That’s a nice way to say it...We put
          our trust in fate.
                                                         5.


                    JOANNA
          Accident or design, the age old
          question. God or man?

                     MACKENSIE
          I don’t trust man, and I’m not so sure
          about God.

                    JOANNA
              (looks at him)
          That sounds very lonely.

She’s found some truth about him. He looks momentarily away.
His moment reflecting on this, too close to home, is short
lived...but what he does say...

                    MACKENSIE
              (by way of an answer)
          That woman, the doctor, I had known
          was a gerontologist, took care of old
          people. She told me about a woman who
          was a patient she had to tell had
          onset Alzheimer’s. The woman thought
          about it and asked her, “If I lose my
          memory, did I ever exist?”

It gives her pause for thought...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          I’ve thought about that long and hard
          and haven’t come up with an answer.
          It’s a mystery.

                    JOANNA
          Maybe there isn’t an answer. Maybe no
          answer is the right answer. Everything
          isn’t knowable.

                    MACKENSIE
              (that rare smile)
          We’re quite different, you and I. I
          need to have conclusion. I need to
          come to an end.

                    JOANNA
              (looks at him)
          That sounds ominous. What do you do,
          Mr. Mackensie?

                    MACKENSIE
          Nothing very extraordinary. I’m an
          adjustor.
                                                         6.


                    JOANNA
          A chiropractor?

                    MACKENSIE
              (laughs)
          God no. I’m not deft enough to crack a
          back...
              (a small smile)
          I would just break it...I’m a claim
          adjustor. I come quite a bit to
          London. Our main office is here.
              (after a beat)
          I make sure everything is taken care
          of, neat and tidy. That people get
          what they deserve. Nothing more.
          Nothing less. Just what they are
          entitled to.

                    JOANNA
          That sounds malevolent.

                    MACKENSIE
          I’m the mildest man you will ever
          meet. Some people say I am so
          nondescript they can’t remember me.
          Gray, you know, is a color.

                    JOANNA
          I don’t believe that. (and observant)
          You have, for instance, distinctly
          hazel eyes. Your fingernails are
          perfectly cut. You don’t miss a place
          shaving. Not a hair awry. I think for
          all you say you try to blend in, to be
          forgotten, you are quite
          distinctive...
              (sniffs)
          Even your cologne is a healthy musk.

She looks at him.

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          I think you are more than meets the
          eye.

He doesn’t say anything. A Flight Attendant asks them about
drinks. They both settle on Diet Cokes.

                     MACKENSIE
          You too?

                     JOANNA
          Me too?
                                                 7.


                    MACKENSIE
          I thought maybe you were in the
          program.

                    JOANNA
          I was...I am...You?

                    MACKENSIE
          Twenty plus years. Dry as a bone.

                    JOANNA
          Seven. Struggling still.

                    MACKENSIE
              (smiles)
          I’ll keep an eye on you.

                    JOANNA
              (smiles)
          I’ll keep an eye on you.

They lapse into quiet. After some moments:

                    MACKENSIE
          What kind of work do you do?

                    JOANNA
          I’m a mystery novelist.

                    MACKENSIE
              (impressed)
          A novelist. How do you come up with
          your ideas? From your life?

                    JOANNA
          Every character’s the writer in
          disguise.

                    MACKENSIE
          Have you written anything I would
          know?

                    JOANNA
          I write novels mostly about women in
          distress. My last was called “Girl
          Downstairs.”

                    MACKENSIE
          You wrote that? I read that in one
          sitting on a plane from Amsterdam to
          South Africa.

                    JOANNA
          What did you think?
                                         8.


          MACKENSIE
You surprised me. I wasn’t ready for
the daughter being her mother the
whole time.

           JOANNA
    (nods)
My books are full of surprises, I
hope. I can write about it, but I’m
not as good with surprises in my
everyday life.

          MACKENSIE
I try to eliminate all elements of
surprise. I can handle things
efficiently then.

          JOANNA
That was a fiction I borrowed from a
true crime story. It came from a
French woman, Jeanne Calment, who
claimed she was the oldest woman in
the world. She died at one hundred and
twenty-three years old. Everyone
hailed her. Imagine of all the
billions of people that lived and died
she was the very oldest ever known. It
turns out, like everything, it might
not have been true. It was discovered,
to avoid paying inheritance tax, they
said her daughter had died when it was
actually her. Her daughter continued
the charade for another 70 years.

          MACKENSIE
Not to be cynical, but I think larceny
is a small part of everyone’s soul.
Whether it’s a little bottle of
perfume you pocket at a department
store, or getting your kid into
college where they aren’t qualified,
or living your life under false
pretenses...And if you get away with
it...

          JOANNA
    (honestly)
I have done some things I wish I
hadn’t done.

          MACKENSIE
    (a smile)
I won’t ask.
                                                         9.


                    JOANNA
              (smiles)
          I wouldn’t answer.

                    MACKENSIE
          Before I mind my business. Are you
          writing anything new?

                    JOANNA
          I don’t know what I’m writing yet.
          Just thinking about it.

The Flight Attendant asks if they want refills.

                    MACKENSIE
              (asks Joanna)
          It’s just the “two” of us alone
          here...I won’t say a word if you
          wouldn’t...One small cocktail? Between
          friends?

                    JOANNA
              (smiles, tempted)
          You are bad.

She hesitates.

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          I guess I’ve got nothing to lose.

                    MACKENSIE
              (his smile)
          Maybe neither of us do.

                    JOANNA
              (to the Attendant)
          Gin and tonic with a slice of lime.

                    MACKENSIE
          Two.

The Flight Attendant leaves.

                    JOANNA
              (anticipating)
          It’s been so long I can already feel a
          tingling in my mouth of expectation in
          the back of my throat how good it
          tastes.
              (fairly blushes, hoarse)
          That didn’t sound right.

He laughs at the taste “entendre.” The Attendant returns with
their drinks. They both look at them.
                                                        10.


                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
              (reassessing, laughs)
          This is a really bad idea?

                    MACKENSIE
          Really bad.

                    JOANNA
          That’s why it’s so tempting.

She smiles, enjoying the temptation.

                    MACKENSIE
              (toasting)
          To forbidden fruit.

                    JOANNA
          Forbidden fruit.

She clinks his glass. They drink. Both of them cough, not
used to the taste anymore. Their eyes meet and hold. Joanna
looks away, obviously upset. She hesitates, then:

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          Can I tell you something personal?

He listens avidly. And she says, startling...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          I’m going to kill myself.

A beat, Mackensie looks at her, not sure if it’s a bad joke.

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          Well, I’m not going to kill myself.
          I’ve already done it.

                    MACKENSIE
              (confused)
          How do you mean?

                    JOANNA
          Well, it’s not me who’s killing
          myself, it’s them.

                    MACKENSIE
              (completely confused)
          Them?

                    JOANNA
              (literal)
          I signed an agreement... (looks at
          watch) four hours ago. Just before
          boarding the plane.
                                                   11.


                       MACKENSIE
          Agreement?

                    JOANNA
          With an agency. A place where they
          offer unique services, a place you can
          hire someone who in essence puts you
          out of your misery; quickly, quietly,
          and painlessly. It’s called “London.”

                    MACKENSIE
              (trying to make sense of
               it)
          You mean, like assisted suicide?

                    JOANNA
          Yes, only with more assistance. The
          difference is they kill you in such a
          way that it doesn’t really look like
          suicide.

He looks at her as if questioning her stability.

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          I know it sounds like I’m crazy.

                    MACKENSIE
              (wry)
          It’s not normal conversation between
          strangers on a plane.

And even she laughs.

                    JOANNA
              (intimate, whispers)
          This has to be just between us,
          because there is a confidentiality
          clause in the contract, so I’m not
          actually supposed to talk to anyone
          about it.

                    MACKENSIE
          Who would I tell?

                     JOANNA
          It’s just...so intolerably lonely. And
          like you said, you are a stranger
          after all.

                    MACKENSIE
              (despite his skepticism,
               willing to talk)
          Is this what you still want to do?
                                                          12.


                    JOANNA
              (quiet)
          I do. The contract is non-reversible.
          I’ll be killed within three weeks.

                    MACKENSIE
              (a smile, not taking it
               particularly seriously)
          Is that business days?

                     JOANNA
              (not smiling, deadly
               serious)
          Twenty one days. (looking at her
          watch) Actually twenty and a half now.
          I’m flying without a parachute.
              (beat)
          You’re sitting next to a corpse.

She laughs at the dark absurdity, raises her glass to toast
him.

                    MACKENSIE
              (trying to deflect, wry)
          I might be old fashioned but I thought
          murder was against the law.

After a moment of hesitation, despite his reluctance...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
              (toasts her)
          Between strangers. I’ll buy it.

She clinks his glass.


INT. AIRPLANE - LATER

They’re eating dinner now. One drink has become three.

                    MACKENSIE
          Do you know how it will happen?

                    JOANNA
          You’re not told. Only that there are
          countless ways, and that it will
          happen within three weeks of the
          contract being signed. We’re not given
          any examples either, because that way
          we would, consciously or not, avoid
          certain situations. All I was told is
          that it will be completely painless,
          and that I really won’t see it coming.
                                                           13.


                    MACKENSIE
          I see.

                    JOANNA
          Then why do you look as if you don’t
          see?

                    MACKENSIE
          I’m naturally skeptical and this is
          beyond comprehending. I guess I
          probably need an explanation for why
          you want to kill yourself.

                    JOANNA
              (a private beat, and she
               simply says...)
          Danny boy. (a deep remembrance) He was
          just over from Ireland. He came with a
          friend of mine to a reading I was
          doing at the Y. His voice was lilting.
          For three years he made me feel like I
          was the only person to exist. We went
          everywhere...

                    MACKENSIE
          What did he do?

                    JOANNA
          He was a playwright. Irish theatre. We
          would sit and write together in bed. I
          told him all of my ideas and he was
          always the best critic and the most
          ardent fan. My muse. We went and saw a
          play of his at the four hundred year
          old Abbey Theatre in Dublin. He stayed
          to say goodbye to the cast...the
          theatre by that time had closed...we
          were leaving...the stage was empty...
          He kissed me...we made love right
          there on the stage floor of the set of
          a Dublin pub...

And perhaps we see a glimpse of that, Joanna with a long
haired Irish playwright making love on the stage floor.

Her eyes are filled with tears...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          We stayed for two weeks in a house in
          the country in Derry...I had never
          been so happy...

                    MACKENSIE
          What changed?
                                                   14.


                    JOANNA
          I saw a text. The whole time he had
          another family...He went home and
          never came back...

                    MACKENSIE
          I’m sure that broke your heart. But it
          made you want to hurt yourself
          permanently?

                    JOANNA
              (she nods, quietly...)
          It did...it does...
              (after a beat)
          I was married twice before. As I said
          I’m no Audrey Hepburn, I’m not happy
          that easily. Things didn’t work out.
          As much for them as for me. I’m not a
          love addict. But I believe you can
          find somebody who is perfect for you.
          Only for you. He was mine. I have had
          a very difficult time without him. It
          felt like the end of something, a door
          closing, forever. That I would never
          find somebody I loved and nobody would
          love me that way ever again. It got to
          the point I was seeing my shrink
          daily. I literally couldn’t breathe.
          They say time heals all wounds. I gave
          it time. But my heart wouldn’t heal.
          It crushed me day and night. The most
          terrible deep ache. I thought more and
          more about doing something rash. I
          even stood on the Brooklyn Bridge. But
          I chickened out.

And she starts to cry.

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          It’s too much for me.

                    MACKENSIE
              (genuinely empathetic)
          I wish I could give you peace.

                     JOANNA
              (a wan smile)
          Got a gun?

                    MACKENSIE
              (his smile)
          I’m unarmed.

She looks at him, taken with him for a moment...
                                                        15.


                    JOANNA
          You seem like a kind man. Do you have
          anybody?

                    MACKENSIE
          I did. She passed away five years ago.
          April 12th. A Tuesday. She was
          complaining about a pain in her back
          for months...when they finally did a
          scan it turned out she had liver
          cancer...she died nine months later...

                    JOANNA
          I’m so sorry...

                    MACKENSIE
          She was my northern star. For a long
          time I had nothing to live for. I was
          so lost and alone I thought the
          unthinkable at every bridge and tall
          building and subway stop.

                    JOANNA
          What changed that?

                    MACKENSIE
          A friend of a friend recommended me
          for a job opportunity. I found my
          calling.

                    JOANNA
          What was that?

                    MACKENSIE
          As mundane as it might seem, bringing
          closure for people. It’s honest work.
          It’s given me purpose.

He’s quiet...she looks at him...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          Your playwright would probably call it
          a curtain call.

And there’s something deadly honest about the way he says
that.

                    JOANNA
          You are quite different. You seem to
          be one person and then another. I
          can’t pin down who you are. One side
          of you is charming. The other is
          unsettling.
                                                        16.


INT. AIRPLANE - LATER

The plane completely darkened, people sleeping. Joanna and
Mackensie sitting in the dark.

                    MACKENSIE
          So at most you have twenty-one days to
          live.

                     JOANNA
              (nods)
          Soon just twenty and a half.

                    MACKENSIE
          And what do you intend to do with
          them?

                    JOANNA
          Do what I’ve never done before. Talk
          and drink with strangers. Experience
          new things I would never have
          experienced.

She looks at him.

                      JOANNA (CONT’D)
          Be brave.

She empties her glass with a long swallow. They share a long
look.

                    MACKENSIE
          I guess if you don’t have anything
          left to lose, bravery would probably
          be a good place to start.

He looks at her.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          How do I know this isn’t all just an
          idea of yours for your book?

                     JOANNA
              (a private smile)
          You don’t.

Mackensie gets up from his seat.

                    MACKENSIE
          Excuse me...

She watches him, his strong figure, make his way up the dark
aisle to the restroom. She looks down the aisle after him.
                                                        17.


INT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM - NIGHT

Finished, he’s washing his hands. There’s a soft knock on the
door. He opens it...and Joanna is there. She slides inside,
closing and locking the door. She fervently pushes against
him. She hikes up her skirt, she fumbles to undo his belt. He
lets her at first, then pulls back, hesitant.

                    JOANNA
              (stopping)
          What is it? Are you afraid?

                    MACKENSIE
              (a beat, then, sheepishly)
          Yes. Women who take sexual initiative
          intimidate me.

Which makes Joanna metaphorically embarrassed. She
straightens herself...

                    JOANNA
          It isn’t really my style either.

She starts to leave.

                       JOANNA (CONT’D)
          I’m sorry.

He takes her shoulder and surprising her, tenderly kisses
her. And now there is a real intimacy in this closed bathroom
inside an airplane.

                    MACKENSIE
              (taken with her)
          Are you going on anywhere or are you
          staying in London?

                    JOANNA
          I don’t know why, but I was going to
          Reykjavik. It sounded adventurous.

                     MACKENSIE
              (without affect)
          It does...

She looks at him.

                    JOANNA
          Do you want me to go?

He doesn’t say anything.
                                                          18.


                    MACKENSIE
          What if we fall for each other? I’ve
          just met you and I would lose you.

They just look at each other when there’s a knock on the
door. They open the door and the Flight Attendant, seeing
both of them:

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          One at a time, please.


INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

The dark plane. Under blankets, they have   laid their seats
flat like a king sized bed...the arm rest   all that’s between
them...They lay in the darkness...she has   raised her shade...
The moon bathing them; its white light on   them through her
window...

                    JOANNA
          I rarely can sleep in the best of
          circumstances.

                    MACKENSIE
          We would make a miserable couple. I
          can sleep through anything.

                    JOANNA
          They say that’s a sign of somebody
          without a conscience.

He looks at her in the moonlight...He conjectures...

                    MACKENSIE
              (whispers)
          Isn’t there something we can do? Can’t
          we buy you out of this contract?

                    JOANNA
          It’s unbreakable.

                    MACKENSIE
          Do you still think you’ve made the
          right choice?

                    JOANNA
              (unsure)
          I don’t really know. I’m like Hamlet,
          a doubter. Maybe the kingdom of death
          is worse than the vale of tears.
                                                        19.


                    MACKENSIE
              (foolish)
          We can make a run for it.

                    JOANNA
          Running away...that sounds so
          enchanting...where would we go?

                    MACKENSIE
              (imagining)
          I would take you to Poets’ Corner at
          Westminster Abbey, where Yeats and
          Keats and Darwin lie...


INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT

Christopher Wren’s empty magical and elegant 10th Century
church, built through him by the hand of God. Mackensie and
Joanna stand looking at the names of the great poets and
artists...looking down at their feet metaphorically standing
on them...

                    JOANNA
          Yeats proposed to his lover, an
          actress Maude Gonne, five times in
          twenty-five years. She would never
          leave her husband. He bought a Norman
          tower and rebuilt it on his country
          house to her memory. He wrote...”When
          you are old and gray and full of
          sleep, and nodding by the fire, take
          down this book, and slowly read, and
          dream of the soft look your eyes had
          once, and of their shadows deep...”

                    MACKENSIE (OVER)
          We could take the Chunnel to Paris...


INT. THE CHUNNEL TRAIN - NIGHT

The lights going by as they sit together racing through the
tunnel under the sea...


INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

She has closed her eyes, drifting...imagining...

                    MACKENSIE
          We could take the Metro...
                                                           20.


INT. THE METRO - DAY

Riding the Metro.

                    MACKENSIE (OVER)
          Go down into the tunnels below
          Paris...


INT. THE PARIS TUNNELS - NIGHT

They walk through the tunnels...where people are living all
kinds of lives under the city in encampments...someone
singing...someone dancing...someone laughing...someone
crying...

                    MACKENSIE (OVER)
          The Paris opera...


INT. THE PARIS OPERA - NIGHT

They watch a heartbreaking ballet.

                    MACKENSIE (OVER)
          Watch the sunrise over Montmarte.


EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP, PARIS - DAYBREAK

Sitting on a hotel suite’s roof terrace eating bread and
cheese...


INT. HOTEL ROOM, PARIS - DAYBREAK

Making love in the first light on a bed in a hotel suite...


INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

He’s quiet, feeling foolish.

                    MACKENSIE
          I don’t know what got into me. I’m not
          usually so talkative. I grew up with a
          stutter...I was taught to swallow
          anything that I didn’t need to say...

                    JOANNA
          Don’t stop. It’s so wonderful. I’m
          falling asleep...

Joanna takes a pill box out of her purse...takes up a pill...
                                                        21.


                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          Ambien...mother’s little helper...

She swallows the pill without any water...She crawls further
under the blanket, burrowing...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
              (murmurs)
          Tell me what else we would do...?

                    MACKENSIE
              (after a beat)
          Maybe we’ll go to Marrakech...walk in
          the desert...


EXT. THE DESERT, MARRAKECH - DAY

We see that...


INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

                    MACKENSIE
          Or in a hotel on the Amalfi coast...


EXT. THE AMALFI COAST - DAY

We see that with its eternal light on the Mediterranean...


INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

And we see he has quieted...Upset, near tears...

                    MACKENSIE
          My wife and I stayed at the Santa
          Caterina...We found a piece of Roman
          glass...

We see a blue piece of Roman glass they have found among the
rocks on the Mediterranean shore...

He’s silent with his thoughts...

                    JOANNA
              (her eyes closed,
               imagining...)
          Please don’t stop...

Gathering his composure...
                                                        22.


                    MACKENSIE
          The fourteenth century moorish castle,
          Castel dos Mouros, in the town of
          Sintra in Portugal...


EXT. CASTEL DOS MOUROS, PORTUGAL - DAY

We see them on the narrow path precariously walking along the
ancient castle’s fortress wall...


INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

                    MACKENSIE
          Or off of Africa...the Isle of Lemu...


EXT. THE ISLE OF LEMU

We see them floating together in the coral turquoise African
sea...


IN THE DARK PLANE...

                    MACKENSIE
              (passionately)
          It wouldn’t matter where we went or
          what we did if we had each other...

He looks over at her...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          If I could give you a fantasy for
          three weeks I would.

                    JOANNA
          I would go for that.

And embracing that thought she gives him a small satisfied
smile...Closing her eyes...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
              (murmurs)
          Tell me more.

                    MACKENSIE
          Walking along a river in Vietnam...
          Seeing the tigers in India... Sleeping
          under the stars in the Himalayas...

Her eyes are shutting for good...
                                                        23.


                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          You’re the writer, I’m sure you could
          imagine it better than I ever could...

She looks at him once more as if being certain to remember
him...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          Sweet dreams...

And breathing regularly, she is peacefully asleep...He’s
quiet, lying in the dark, Joanna asleep beside him. We look
at her, head on the pillow, bathed in the darkness...

And we come TRACKING along the aisle of people in various
positions asleep...and we arrive at Mackensie laying side by
side with Joanna in the darkened plane...Joanna sleeping.
He’s still. He looks at her figure...her cheek out of the
cover...He lays quietly for some moments in the dark,
listening to her rhythmic breathing...He fingers a ring on
his hand...and opal...He looks at her, he hesitates, a long
moment’s indecision...But he has a job to do and he lightly
pushes the opal; it slides away...under it we see a small
amount of powder...He takes out a sewing needle from his
pocket...he licks it, hesitates again, and then judicious
like an expert chemist puts it into the powder...The powder
sticking to the needle’s wet end...He looks over at her still
figure...And ever so lightly he brings the needle to the
crevice in her neck behind her earlobe...He starts to stick
the needle into the crevice, just enough to draw a small
pearl of blood, and seems about to go deeper...when he stops.
And making a fateful decision, he withdraws the needle and
stows it away...and all that’s left is the smallest pearl
drop of BLOOD where the needle had been...as small as a
teardrop... And as he quickly dabs the blood away with his
little finger...Joanna left to sleep, having felt
nothing...As Roy Orbison sang: “In dreams...”


INT. AIRPLANE, LONDON - MORNING

Great activity; people getting their things to disembark. We
see Mackensie shaking Joanna, trying to wake her from a deep
sleep...She stirs, groggy...

                    MACKENSIE
              (quickly)
          Time to go.

She shakes herself, coming awake...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          What are you going to do?
                                                        24.


Her Apple type watch “BINGS”...She looks at it...

                    JOANNA
          Twenty days left...

It’s sobering, she comes fully awake...weighing her options,
confused...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
              (what she’s going to
               do...)
          I’m not sure...I don’t know...

                    MACKENSIE
          When you do...if you decide to...

He puts a slip of paper in her hand...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          I’ll leave you a key.

He rushes out of the airplane. She opens the paper: which
just says: “Connaught.”


INT. BAGGAGE HALL - DAY

An African DRIVER meeting him with a sign, simply: “London.”

                     THE DRIVER
          Hello, sir, welcome back. How was your
          trip over?

                    MACKENSIE
              (that smile)
          I got drunk and slept most of the way.

The Driver laughs. As they come outside:


EXT. HEATHROW - DAY

It’s pissing rain as only it can in London.

                    THE DRIVER
          I’m afraid we’ve had a bit of rain,
          over a week...

And as he holds up an umbrella for him, walking through the
rain toward a waiting car...

                     THE DRIVER (CONT’D)
          How long are you to stay in London
          this time?
                                                        25.


                    MACKENSIE
          It’ll be quick.

                    THE DRIVER
          Mind your step...

Opening the car door for him...

                    THE DRIVER (CONT’D)
          You’re staying at the usual I trust?

                    MACKENSIE
              (shakes “yes”)
          The usual, the Berkeley.

As the Driver lowers his umbrella and Mackensie gets into the
car...


INT. HEATHROW, LONDON - DAY

We see Joanna in the main hall looking at the giant departure
screens. She can see the flight to “Reykjavik” is leaving in
less than an hour. She looks at her watch, making a decision.
A Man bumps into her. She virtually jumps out of her skin. He
apologizes and moves off. She looks over at other people all
around her...any one of them could be her appointed killer.


EXT. THE BERKELEY HOTEL - DAY

Rain falling on the staid old hotel...We see Mackensie with
the help of the African driver exit the car. The Driver
carrying his bags walking him under his umbrella to the
hotel. They say goodbye, Mackensie taking his bags going
inside. The Driver coming back to the car. Taking up his
phone, calling someone...As he gets back into the car and
drives off...Some few moments...and we see Mackensie,
carrying his bags, coming right back out of the Hotel. He
gets into a waiting taxi.


INT. TAXI, LONDON - DAY

                    MACKENSIE
          The Connaught, please...


INT. HEATHROW, MAIN HALL - DAY

The main hall with the giant departure screens. We see that
the flight to “Reykjavik” is blinking, “Boarding.” We look
for Joanna and see she is gone.
                                                        26.


EXT. THE CONNAUGHT HOTEL, LONDON - DAY

The elegant Hotel in the rain.


INT. MACKENSIE’S ROOM, CONNAUGHT, SHOWER - AFTERNOON

We see Mackensie under a hot shower...the steam fogging the
glass...And the shower door suddenly opens and Joanna, naked,
having plainly made her decision, comes in with him. She
stops him from saying anything with a kiss...and as they
blindly throw themselves into each other, gratefully holding
onto each other as if a port in the storm...and as they
ardently make love in the hotel shower...


INT. MACKENSIE’S HOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Dressed in her red beret and coat, Joanna comes into the
living room. Mackensie, dressed again in his suit and his
overcoat, is sitting in an overstuffed easy chair. He leans
his hands on his thighs like a prizefighter, and he says,
forthright...

                    MACKENSIE
              (simply)
          I am an assassin.

She stops. He looks up.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          I had come to keep your “appointment.”
          It was arranged for me to sit next to
          you.

Before she can say anything...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          I have peacefully ended nine other
          people’s lives. Some of them were
          terminal...another had a child that
          had died...most had such grave
          depression...and now you...

He pauses, quiet...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          I pride myself on doing what I am
          paid to do and doing it better than
          anyone else...I always finish a
          job...I’ve never had that happen to me
          before...I’ve learned not to feel
          anything...they teach you that...
                    (MORE)
                                                   27.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          Your instinct as a human being is if
          you shoot somebody to reach to help
          them up...Unless you are a sociopath,
          you have to learn how to swallow your
          emotions...and shoot them again and
          again until they are dead...But I
          couldn’t...

                       JOANNA
          Why?

                    MACKENSIE
          I don’t know...something about you...I
          felt something I hadn’t felt in a long
          time. I can’t even describe it. It was
          just a feeling. I didn’t want to be
          apart from you. I wanted to follow our
          story... where do we go, how do we end
          up?

She’s still, unsure.

                    JOANNA
          You are very good at what you do. In
          the most lovely way you gave me the
          possibility of intimacy, connection,
          romance, and hope. It was what I
          needed. And with such skill, you are
          very seductive. “Call me Doc.” The
          self-conscious inarticulateness, the
          stutter. How “you hadn’t felt that way
          in a long time.” Your wife, your
          “northern star.” Did you even have a
          wife?

He doesn’t answer her.

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          So am I just a three week mercy fuck?

                    MACKENSIE
          Mercy would have been killing you on
          that plane.

                    JOANNA
          What if you don’t like me? What if you
          discover when we’ve run away to
          Barcelona or Cape Town or who knows
          where that I don’t match up to your
          expectations?

                    MACKENSIE
          Or I don’t match yours...
                                                        28.


                    JOANNA
          What if you regret you didn’t kill me?

                    MACKENSIE
              (being him)
          I could always kill you.

She’s quiet knowing that is just so. He gets up and goes to
the window...looking outside...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
              (concerned)
          The penalty for not finishing the job
          is they send somebody to complete what
          you had contracted for, and for me,
          now being a liability, end my career.

                    JOANNA
              (looking outside)
          How will they find us?

His phone RINGS. He looks down at his phone...it just says
“LONDON.”

                    MACKENSIE
          They already have.


INT. A LONDON TAXI - DAY

Rain running down the windows. Mackensie and Joanna in the
back of the hansom cab are embroiled in a heated discussion:

                    MACKENSIE
          -- They won’t allow that to happen!

                    JOANNA
              (adamant)
          I have to try...

And before he can object any further she jumps out of the
Taxi...


EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

Rain falling. And we see they are parked in front of a
nondescript brick building with a few windows and a single
name over the doorbell, “London.” She looks up very aware of
the security camera looking down on her. She buzzes. A moment
and the door sounds opening. She looks for a moment back at
the Taxi in the rain, Mackensie in the window...She hesitates
and goes inside...
                                                        29.


INT. THE LONDON AGENCY - NIGHT

She climbs up a staircase to a small reception area. Cameras
are visible everywhere. Nobody seems to be there, but most
immediately a door opens and a YOUNG MAN in an expensive
tailored suit answers. Before she can say anything:

                    THE TAILORED YOUNG MAN
          Ms. Dunlap. Please follow me.

He takes her behind the reception door inside. A hallway with
some few doors all of which are closed and always seem to be
closed. He takes her to a corner office, knocks once, a VOICE
is heard, and he shows her in. Where a tall Man in an
unremarkable suit, a man with very little affect, is standing
at his desk greeting her without a hint there is a person
inside him, metaphorically an invisible man...

                    THE INVISIBLE MAN
          So nice to meet you. I’ve read all
          your books. “Girl Up A Tree” was my
          favorite. The way she got her revenge
          with her husband was so deserved, and
          felt so real. The way you described
          the curved spike of the fire poker
          hitting him clean in the forehead...
          How you said it made such a little
          mark for the force that was applied
          and then seemed to open up his
          forehead like a puckered fruit.
          (marvels at the sound of...) “Puckered
          fruit.” You do have quite an
          imagination, quite a way with words,
          Ms. Dunlap. (without a pause) How can
          I help you? What seems to be the
          problem?

                    JOANNA
          I’ve had a change of heart. I want to
          cancel my contract.

He furrows his brow.

                    THE INVISIBLE MAN
          That is not usual for us. Not usual at
          all.

                    JOANNA
              (simply)
          I wasn’t thinking clearly when I
          signed the agreement...
                                                           30.


                    THE INVISIBLE MAN
          We understand how upsetting this all
          must be. The job wasn’t done well, not
          well at all. He was one of our very
          best. We can only think he forgot
          himself and became somehow personally
          involved. I’m afraid we can’t let that
          happen. He will have to be removed
          from the assignment of course, and we
          will fulfill our obligations. I
          understand we still have just short of
          three weeks...

                    JOANNA
          I don’t want it to happen anymore...

                    THE INVISIBLE MAN
              (frowning)
          I understand...I assume you are well
          aware of the terms of our
          contract...Of course once you signed
          it, it was may I say, “executed.”

                    JOANNA
          I completely understand what I agreed
          to...I’m not here about the money, I
          want the contract voided...there won’t
          be any need for it anymore...

The phone rings. He gets it. He listens. He says...

                       THE INVISIBLE MAN
          Excellent.

He hangs up.

                    THE INVISIBLE MAN (CONT’D)
          That was my manager. He said, despite
          our agreement, in this rare instance
          we can make the contract null and
          void. (personally) He is quite a fan
          of yours also and I think he selfishly
          wants to read more...
              (standing, ending...)
          I’m glad we could come to a satisfying
          conclusion. These things can become
          rather messy. It will be taken care
          of, removed from the books...thank you
          for coming...

But something, her story training pokes her intuition...
                                                        31.


                    JOANNA
              (skeptical)
          Just like that?

                    THE INVISIBLE MAN
          We don’t believe in unnecessarily
          prolonging things.

He opens the door, showing her out...

                    THE INVISIBLE MAN (CONT’D)
          I’ll be looking for your next book.

                    JOANNA
              (throws off)
          Maybe you’ll be in it...

And for the first and probably last time he smiles, a toothy
smile of someone who is sure of the eventuality of all
things...and he says something all too familiar to us in
another context, but here most chilling...

                     THE INVISIBLE MAN
              (his final words)
          Be safe...

His smile goes as quickly as it’s come. The door closing
after her. She moves back along the closed doors hallway,
starting for the stairs...when she sees a Security Guard has
come to stand by the front door waiting at the bottom of the
stairs with an open umbrella for her. He offers her an
accommodating hand, even that seeming malevolent...

                    SECURITY GUARD
          Mind your step on the stairs, they
          could be wet...

And as she goes past him out the door...


EXT. TAXI, ANOTHER STREET - DAY

The Taxi parked on another street in the rain, Joanna and
Mackensie in the back.


INT. TAXI - DAY

She looks at her watch...

                    JOANNA
              (looking)
          ...twenty days...
                                                           32.


They’re quiet, looking out at the rain.

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          Twenty more days. What happens if they
          haven’t killed me, they haven’t
          fulfilled the contract and I manage to
          live for the twenty-one days, the
          three weeks?

                    MACKENSIE
          That would make the contract null and
          void.

It gives her a moment’s satisfaction at the possibility.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
              (simply, spoiling that)
          It’s never happened.


EXT. A SUBURBAN LONDON ROW HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

We see a neighborhood of one after another of small old
traditional suburban faux brick English row houses...we
already know what each looks like inside; the carpet color,
the wallpaper, the linoleum floor in the kitchen, the clock
that looks like a cat with its wagging tail keeping time...

When we see an overweight fastidiously dressed MAN in his
early sixties carrying a large wrapped gift get out of a
chauffeured car. With his hat and finely tailored suit, that
despite his size fits like a well made glove, he looks like a
barrister or an MP, or a latter day version of Alec Guinness
in “The Ladykillers,” elegant, graceful, and deadly. We will
come to know him as MR. LIME.

He goes up the steps to the row house. The door is open,
welcoming...


INT. SUBURBAN ROW HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

He comes quietly inside...so quiet that women busy in the
kitchen don’t notice him...He goes out a patio door...


EXT. SUBURBAN ROW HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

...where various families are sitting around a small
backyard...children playing at a birthday party...He silently
stands apart holding his gift...when a little Boy comes
cautiously over to him...The Boy stops, intimidated by him...
                                                          33.


                    THE LITTLE BOY
              (shyly)
          Grandpa.

The Man takes the Boy’s little arm bringing him closer, but
not quite to him...as near as he gets to touching someone
much less hugging someone...He gives him the gift...The Boy
looks if it is alright to open it...

                    MR. LIME
          Yes, certainly, open it...

The Boy opens it...It’s a large stuffed horse...the Boy is
delighted...rubbing its mane...

                    THE LITTLE BOY
              (turning)
          Mummy, look what Grandfather brought
          me...

A harried Woman looks over...The Boy returns to his
Grandfather, but he’s already, like the end of the day,
disappearing as quietly as he came...

And we hear Mackensie’s VOICE, OVER.

                    MACKENSIE (OVER)
          You’re going to go to a quiet bar by
          the Thames known as the White Lion.


INT. MOVING TAXI - NIGHT

Mackensie and Joanna in the back of the hansom cab on their
way somewhere...

                    MACKENSIE (OVER)
          Have a drink by yourself...


INT. THE WHITE LION - NIGHT

And we see Joanna sitting virtually alone at the bar in a
quiet lonely pub having a drink...

                    MACKENSIE (OVER)
          When you pay, leave a note with your
          bill that you intend to kill yourself
          by jumping from a bridge. And leave
          right away.

Joanna writing a “suicide” note on a paper napkin, folding
it, leaving it with her bill and her payment under her empty
glass...Getting up and leaving the bar right away...
                                                        34.


                      MACKENSIE (OVER) (CONT’D)
            Go to the Vauxhall Bridge...


EXT. THE VAUXHALL BRIDGE, OVER THE THAMES - NIGHT

We see Joanna coming along the distinctive bridge over the
Thames, stopping, looking down at the water...

                      MACKENSIE (OVER)
            Wait until nobody else is in sight...

The Bridge road emptying, becoming quiet...Joanna on the dark
street looking down at the dark water, nobody else around...

                      MACKENSIE (OVER) (CONT’D)
            It is high enough to break your neck
            and if that doesn’t kill you the
            freezing water will...I disposed of a
            difficult subject there once...I had
            tried to kill him in the most
            painless, efficient of ways...

And WE SEE IN RAPID MACABRE SUCCESSION:


THE TUBE

MACKENSIE WALKING BY A MAN STANDING HOLDING ONTO A STRAP ON
THE TUBE, STUMBLING INTO HIM WHERE WE SEE HIM QUICKLY INJECT
HIM WITH THE SMALL BUT DEADLY SEWING NEEDLE IN THE HAND...

                      MACKENSIE (OVER)
            A small prick, a toxin much like I was
            going to give you...

AND AS THE MAN IS UNAWARE WHAT HAPPENED BUT A “BEE STING,”
AND RUBS THE SITE, WHILE MACKENSIE GETS OFF THE TRAIN...

                      MACKENSIE (OVER) (CONT’D)
            For whatever reason it didn’t work...


HYDE PARK

THE MAN TAKING IN THE SUN LAYING ASLEEP ON THE LAWN IN HYDE
PARK...MACKENSIE WALKING OVER...

                      MACKENSIE (OVER)
            You would be surprised what a common
            handkerchief can do...
                                                          35.


...BENDING DOWN AND COVERING HIS FACE WITH A HANDKERCHIEF,
COVERING HIS NOSE AND HIS MOUTH UNTIL HE STOPS BREATHING...
AND WALKING OFF...

                       MACKENSIE (OVER) (CONT’D)
             And for some reason that didn’t work
             either...


STARBUCKS

THE MAN IN   A STARBUCKS ENJOYING A CUP OF COFFEE AS HEAD DOWN
HE READS A   BOOK...WHEN WE SEE MACKENSIE WALKING BY AND DEFT,
WITHOUT AN   UNNECESSARY MOVEMENT, PUTS SOMETHING INTO HIS
COFFEE AND   WALKS ON...

                       MACKENSIE (OVER)
             I gave him enough to kill a horse but
             that didn’t do it either...I had run
             out of options...so that finally...


EXT. THE VAUXHALL BRIDGE - ANOTHER NIGHT

THE MAN STANDING ON THE BRIDGE LOOKING OUT AT THE WATER. WE
SEE A BIKE RIDER APPROACHING HIM. AS HE COMES CLOSER WE SEE
IT’S MACKENSIE. HE STOPS, GETS OFF HIS BIKE, GOES TO STAND
SOME SLIGHT DISTANCE FGROM THE MAN LOOKING OUT AT THE WATER.

                       MACKENSIE
             Lovely evening.

The Man nods...Mackensie comes closer...

                       MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
                 (motions across the way at
                  a building, his smile)
             That’s where James Bond has his
             office...Where his Majesty’s Secret
             Service, MI-6, is.

The Man looks over at the distinctive building.

                       MACKENSIE (OVER) (CONT’D)
             I’d had enough.

...and Mackensie, having had enough, picks the man up under
the arms and simply throws him over the railing...Mackensie
getting on his bike riding off accompanied by a resonant
sound somewhere between a splash and a splat.
                                                        36.


INT. (MOVING) HANSOM CAB - NIGHT

She looks at him remembering if she needed a reminder just
who he is.

                    MACKENSIE
              (his smile)
          I’m kidding!!

(Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t)...but she chooses as we do to
be on the side of the better part of angels and she laughs on
our behalf a hoarse laugh, appreciative...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
              (going on)
          What you will do...


EXT. THE VAUXHALL BRIDGE, LONDON - NIGHT

Joanna on the dark quiet Bridge over the Thames...

                    MACKENSIE (OVER)
          When there is no one else in sight,
          you will leave your shoes on the
          bridge...and walk away...

And we see Joanna, doing as planned, once the bridge is
empty, taking off her shoes and leaving them on the bridge by
the railing, and walking away...


INT. THE WHITE LION BAR BY THE THAMES - NIGHT

We see the Bartender reading the “suicide” note on the napkin
she had left...and going to the phone, dialing...


EXT. THE CONNAUGHT HOTEL - NIGHT

When we see Mr. Lime coming out of a taxi, putting on his
hat, going into the Hotel.


INT. THE CONNAUGHT - NIGHT

We see the elevator arrow coming to a stop on a particular
floor. We see Mr. Lime getting out. He crosses to a room. He
lightly knocks. Quiet. He knocks again. Nothing. Using a pass
key he goes inside.
                                                        37.


INT. MACKENSIE’S ROOM, CONNAUGHT - NIGHT

He looks around the room. He goes into the bedroom...the made
bed...into the bathroom...the discarded towels...Strands of
Joanna’s hair in the sink...He goes into the living room. He
looks at the slightly sunken form on the overstuffed chair
cushion where Mackensie had sat. He meticulously fluffs the
pillow bringing it back to shape. He sits down on the couch
content to wait. He takes up the phone.

                    MR. LIME
          Room service.


EXT. THE THAMES - NIGHT, LATER

When we see Joanna’s shoes she left on the bridge circled
with chalk and protected by crime scene tape. And now we see
Police are collected on the bridge over the Thames, a
HELICOPTER circling, a Police craft in the water, where two
divers are in the water searching...

WHEN WE SEE A PAIR OF WOMAN’S BOOTS COMING ALONG A STREET.


EXT. A LONDON STREET - NIGHT

Where we see Joanna, wearing boots now, carrying her
suitcase, Mackensie beside her, carrying his, hurrying along
a London street...


INT. CONNAUGHT, MACKENSIE’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

We see Mr. Lime sitting at a room service table, wearing a
bib and consuming a lobster. His phone rings. He answers
without saying anything. He listens. He hangs up. He gets up,
taking off his bib, straightening himself. He takes a last
roll, buttering it...puts his hat on and goes out.


INT. CORRIDOR, CONNAUGHT - NIGHT

He patiently waits for the elevator. It arrives. He goes into
the elevator. As he stands with his hat on, finishes the
buttered bread in one bite, the elevator door closes and he
is gone.


EXT. THE THAMES - NIGHT

The Police scene on the bridge and in the water.
                                                        38.


And we see Mr. Lime with his distinctive hat coming out of
the dark, crossing the bridge arriving at the scene...He says
something to a plainclothes officer...they seem to know each
other... The Detective shows him the “suicide note,”
protected in an evidence baggie...He motions at their feet on
the bridge... And Mr. Lime, spreading a handkerchief on the
pavement and kneeling on it so as not to get his pants dirty,
kneels to look at Joanna’s shoes left there...He comes to his
feet, retrieves his handkerchief, folds it neatly back up and
puts it inside his coat pocket. He looks at the activity on
the water...And as he turns and looks off down the street
into the night not believing for an instance anybody has
killed themselves there this evening...


INT. TAXI, LONDON - NIGHT

A Taxi moving quickly with Mackensie and Joanna through
London...they’re both quiet, their lives upended...and Joanna
sees the magnificent edifice of Westminster Abbey.

                    JOANNA
          You said we’d go to Poets’ Corner.

                    MACKENSIE
              (beat, to Driver)
          Stay here...

He pulls over...Mackensie helps Joanna out...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          Hurry.

They rush to the towering church’s doors...It’s closed...Two
machine gun wielding Guards.

                    JOANNA
          It’s closed.

Mackensie goes to the door talking to a Guard...taking out
his wallet showing something to him...The Guard opens the
gates...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
              (hurries to Mackensie)
          How did you?

He opens his wallet showing her a small pin with a
distinctive letter “L” for “London,” and an angel figure for
either an “angel of death” or an “angel of mercy.”

                    MACKENSIE
          It can open or (chilling)...close
          doors.
                                                        39.


INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT

They come inside...it’s empty, dead quiet...She looks at the
roof, awestruck by the majesty...their feet echoing...on the
ancient stone floor...

                    JOANNA
              (in a reverential whisper)
          Kings and Queens have been coronated
          here since 1066...

She looks at the timeless “Coronation Chair.”

                    MACKENSIE
          I promised you...

She turns and he’s come to “Poets’ Corner...” The gravestones
of the people who talked to God.

                    JOANNA
          Imagine being buried here for eternity
          with the greatest writers of the
          written word...

                    MACKENSIE
              (his smile)
          I can arrange it...

She manages a smile...but she is still in the glory of the
eternal church...the poets’ graves at their feet...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          My father said sometimes you have to
          stand on someone else’s shoulders to
          be tall enough to see the sky.

She’s touched...and for letting her experience this...Looking
at him, this man she chose to put her life in his hands...
near tears...she says simply...

                    JOANNA
          Thank you...


EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT

The Taxi driving off, Mackensie and Joanna, luggage in hand,
running down the street to a TRAIN STATION.


INT. ST. PANCRAS TRAIN STATION, LONDON - NIGHT

Mackensie and Joanna, with their luggage, running through the
terminal and along a waiting train. Getting on board.
                                                           40.


INT. THE CHUNNEL TRAIN - NIGHT

They find their seats as the train pulls out of the station.

                    A MAN’S VOICE (OVER)
          Next stop, Paris.

                       JOANNA
          Why Paris?

                    MACKENSIE
          You haven’t lived if you haven’t
          shared Paris with someone you... (he
          hesitates) care about...

                    JOANNA
          You sure know how to melt a heart...

(But) she isn’t convinced...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          How am I to trust you?

He doesn’t say anything...they ride in silence...and her
watch makes its familiar distinctive “BING.”

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          Nineteen days.

...And choosing to believe in him she puts her head on his
shoulder...He puts his arm around her...And as they race in
the dark under the sea...


INT. PARIS GARE DU NORD STATION - MORNING

The train having reached its berth. People streaming off.
Mackensie and Joanna carrying their luggage moving with the
crowd going into the terminal. A WOMAN stops Joanna, causing
her to start...

                    THE WOMAN
              (in French)
          I’m so sorry. Could you tell me where
          you got these boots? They are quite
          attractive.

                    JOANNA
              (in fluent French)
          Thank you. (she looks at the boot
          label) I got them at Barney’s in New
          York...

The Woman thanks her and moves along...
                                                          41.


                    MACKENSIE
              (cautioning her...)
          Don’t stop for anyone whatever the
          reason...

She nods properly chastised...as they move with the people...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          You speak French fluently?

                    JOANNA
          My mother taught French in high
          school. We always spoke at home. She
          tried me at ballet. It wasn’t
          pretty...I had three left feet...

He smiles, moving her quickly along with the crowd...

And we see from ON HIGH, all of the people pouring out of the
station. When somebody catches our eye. And we see Mr. Lime
in his distinctive hat is standing on a balcony overlooking
the crowd of people as they go out. He looks at his cell
phone where a Security Camera surveillance video is playing
with a time stamp of Joanna and Mackensie getting on the
train in London...Mr. Lime standing on the balcony
overlooking the station looking for Joanna and Mackensie. As
the people go by below him...Mackensie and Joanna move among
the crowd approaching the main terminal...Mr. Lime above them
up ahead...When Mackensie suddenly stops, kneeling as if to
tie a shoe...Joanna waiting...but this isn’t an accident...he
waits until the crowd has all but disappeared...and standing,
taking her arm:

                    MACKENSIE
          I wasn’t thinking...crowds are
          deadly...

And he leads her to an Emergency Exit and despite the warning
“ALARM WILL SOUND,” he quickly takes her out the door...The
ALARM sounding after them...While Mr. Lime, from his grand
perch, watches what is left of the people coming off the
train leaving the terminal. The terminal emptying. And as he
stands on the balcony the terminal emptied and all that’s
left is the sound of the Emergency Exit ALARM going off...He
looks across the empty station at the Emergency Exit door
that hasn’t fully closed after them, a shaft of daylight
streaming in where they had gone out.


EXT. PERE LACHAISE CEMETERY, PARIS - DAY

We see Joanna and Mackensie coming through the timeless
cemetery...going past “Moliere’s” gravestone, “Chopin,”
“Abelard and Heloise,” “Oscar Wilde...”
                                                        42.


                    JOANNA
              (mentioning)
          Wilde said, “We are all in the gutter,
          but some of us are looking at the
          stars...”

And “Proust...”

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          “The real voyage of discovery consists
          not in seeking new lands but seeing
          with new eyes.”

                    MACKENSIE
              (taken with her)
          You make everything an adventure.

She doesn’t say anything...He comes by “Jim Morrison’s” grave
with an array of bouquets.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          He said, (his smile) (and he sings)
          “Love me two times, love me two times
          baby...One for tomorrow and once for
          today...”

She laughs, forgetting for a moment their situation, enjoying
him...As they move through the cemetery...

                    JOANNA
              (despite everything)
          Why are we here?

He turns to another row and comes to stand over a small
gravemarker. She comes alongside him. The gravemarker says,
“Nora Weathers,” “1977-2017,” “She sleeps in the laps of the
Gods.”

                    MACKENSIE
          She wanted to be buried here. We came
          to Paris for the last month of her
          life. There wasn’t a moment we wasted.

Joanna is quiet.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          Nora, this is Joanna. I wanted you to
          meet her.

Joanna is moved by that...

                    JOANNA
          I’m sorry I didn’t ever know you,
          Nora.
                                                           43.


                    MACKENSIE
          She knew you in a sense. She liked
          your books. I can still see her curled
          like a cat on a window seat with your
          book in her hand, her brow furrowed
          with concern for the story, reading...

                    JOANNA
              (as if reassuring her)
          He still loves you.

And after a moment...remains jaundiced...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          How do I know any of this is true,
          this isn’t some random grave?

He doesn’t say anything...

                    MACKENSIE
              (pure him)
          Does it matter?

She’s quiet. And wanting to believe him she takes his arm...

                    JOANNA
          I’ve never been to the Eiffel Tower.


EXT. EIFFEL TOWER - NIGHT

Mackensie once again, the Tower being closed, talking to some
guards, showing them his pin.


INT. EIFFEL TOWER ELEVATOR - NIGHT

The two of them in the glass elevator going up the glorious
steel structure.


EXT. EIFFEL TOWER, OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT

Standing on the observation deck looking at the world at
their feet...

                     MACKENSIE
          You are a lot like Audrey Hepburn. But
          I think more in Breakfast at
          Tiffany’s.
              (and more talks than
               sings...as romantic as
               you can get)
          “Moon river...

                                                        44.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT'D)
          Two drifters, off to see the world,
          There's such a lot of world to see
          We're after the same rainbow's end,
          waitin' 'round the bend, My
          huckleberry friend, moon river, and
          me.”

She looks at him, taken with him, and says...

                    JOANNA
          You bastard.

A breeze threatens Joanna’s beret to blow away...Mackensie
stops it, his hand gently on her head...She looks up at
him...and again, moved, simply says for everything...

                       JOANNA (CONT’D)
          Thank you.


INT. FOUR STAR FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

We see Mr. Lime alone eating a many course Michelin meal at
an elegant French restaurant. His phone buzzes. He looks and
sees he’s been sent a Security Camera PHOTOGRAPH of Mackensie
and Joanna going into a French hotel. As he frowns at his
meal being interrupted and wipes his mouth with his napkin...


INT. FRENCH HOTEL, BEDROOM - NIGHT

Joanna and Mackensie asleep together in bed. He awakens to
the sound of a VOICE outside speaking French. He wakes
Joanna.

                    MACKENSIE
          How do you say in French, “I won’t be
          long?”

                    JOANNA
              (waking)
          Je ne serai pas longue...

                    MACKENSIE
          He used the wrong word and said, “Je
          ne serai pas ‘bientot’...” “I won’t be
          ‘shortly’...”

There’s the sound of the Man’s VOICE again, saying something
else...

                    JOANNA
          French isn’t his natural language.
                                                          45.


He hurries to the window...and he sees Mr. Lime in his
distinctive hat coming into the Hotel.

                    MACKENSIE
          They sent somebody... (pulling her up)
          Throw on your clothes...we have to
          go...

They both throw their clothes on...she grabs up her book
bag...while still putting on their clothes he hurries her out
of the room...


INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

They see the elevator ARROW coming   to their floor. He hurries
her to the stairs where he can see   two flights below them Mr.
Lime in his distinctive hat coming   up the stairs...He pulls
her to where a cart is in the door   of a room being serviced.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The Housekeeper starts with a fright. He motions her to be
quiet. She’s terrified. He takes her cell phone from her
pocket...he moves her into the bathroom...he breaks apart the
bathroom phone, motions her to be quiet again...and closes
the door on her. He goes to the door looking out the EYEHOLE.
He can see through the EYEHOLE Mr. Lime moving along the
corridor to their room.

                    MACKENSIE
          That would be Mr. Lime. He is the last
          person you will want to see; because
          he will be the last person you will
          see...

Mr. Lime puts on some kid gloves. He takes off his shoes. He
uses a card key silently opening their room door. As he goes
without a sound inside...


INT. NEARBY ROOM - NIGHT

                    MACKENSIE
              (at EYEHOLE quickly)
          We have to disappear...

And as he takes her out of the room...
                                                        46.


INT. MACKENSIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

The dark room. Mr. Lime, for some reason takes out a pen,
silently clicking it at his side while in his stocking feet
he pads silently across the carpet into the dark BEDROOM. He
raises the innocuous looking pen and in a motion folds it at
an angle to reveal a tiny trigger, turning it into a
miniature .22 pistol with the smallest of silencers called a
“Stinger Pen,” it defines small but deadly...as deadly as the
cattle truncheon the killer, Javier Bardem, carried in “No
Country for Old Men.” And without a moment’s hesitation he
fires into the bed...the dwarf pistol spitting bullets...the
bed, the mattress, in spasms of fire, literally smoldering...
But coming closer he sees it’s empty, the vicious tiny and
efficient pen gun in hand, standing in the dark room over
their empty bed. He hears a car door closing. He goes to the
window looking outside. He sees Joanna and Mackensie getting
into a Taxi and being driven away. He says to himself the
license number...he takes up his phone...texts the taxi
number to someone...pushes send...He goes into the living
room. He turns the pistol back into a pen putting it neatly
back where it belongs in his pocket. He takes up the Hotel
phone. And as his dinner was interrupted:

                    MR. LIME
          Room service.

They answer.

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          To start, onion soup, with extra
          cheese...

WHEN SUDDENLY THERE IS A BURST OF SUNLIGHT.


EXT. A FRENCH COUNTRY ROAD ON THE WAY TO CHANTILLY - MORNING

And we see a modern rental PEUGEOT (what else) coming along a
French country road.


INT. PEUGEOT - MORNING

Joanna is driving, she looks in the rear view mirror where
she sees Mackensie is seemingly asleep laying across the back
seat. She looks at him for some moments thinking how she got
herself into this situation. She looks away, still in the
thought, driving. When we see Mackensie isn’t as asleep as he
seems. And he suddenly sits up, putting his hands around her
throat...and silently and swiftly breaks her neck...the car
rolling to a stop...
                                                        47.


When we see she is still driving, looking again in the rear
view at him asleep in the back seat, his murderous hands on
her neck all in her head. And she sees he’s come awake
looking in the rear view at her.

                    JOANNA
          I imagined you weren’t really asleep.
          That you strangled me...

                    MACKENSIE
          You’ve written too many books.

He climbs into the front seat.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          Why would I want to hurt you?

                    JOANNA
          You seem to have made a way of life of
          it.

                    MACKENSIE
              (trying to reassure her)
          In my other life.

She doesn’t say anything. And as she drives with an assassin
as her companion, running away...


EXT. FRENCH FARMHOUSE ROAD, CHANTILLY - DAY

They drive up an overgrown road to an old two story French
farmhouse. The house in disrepair from disuse...a barn...
fields fallow...They get out...

                    MACKENSIE
          It belongs to my sister from her
          divorce...she hasn’t been here in
          years. It’s a bad memory for her...

They stand looking at the old forgotten house...


INT. FRENCH FARMHOUSE, CHANTILLY - DAY

They come inside. It is as unused and in as much disrepair as
the exterior...as if somebody had just up and left all their
things and never returned...They walk through the house...the
various dusty and unused rooms...suddenly three CATS living
there as startled by them as they are go racing by them out a
broken window...
                                                        48.


                    JOANNA
              (shivers)
          (says the French word) “Chattes.” Cats
          frighten me.

                    MACKENSIE
          Didn’t you have a cat on the cover of
          one of your books?

                    JOANNA
          Very good. “Girl Up A Tree” had a cat
          stuck up a tree, representing a woman
          in trouble on the cover.

It leaves an unsettling feeling as they continue through the
empty house...


EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

They’ve come back outside, looking at the grounds...an empty
swimming pool, forlorn rusted chaises with rotted cushions...
They go into the BARN...where there is still a vintage late
60s wine colored CITROEN CONVERTIBLE...the key right where it
was left...he starts it...after some tries it kicks over...he
shows her how its front compression humorously raises and
lowers its front end...

                    MACKENSIE
          Do you want to try driving it?

                    JOANNA
          I don’t know how to drive a manual
          shift.


EXT. FRENCH FARMHOUSE, CHANTILLY - DAY

Joanna behind the wheel of the Citroen, Mackensie beside
her...Joanna fitting and starting, killing the motor, jerking
and braking, trying to learn using the clutch how to drive
the stick. As she lurches through an overgrown field the car
nearly disappearing in the tall grass...and in a final
paroxysm the car coming to a sudden quit as if it had given
up...They laugh at the absurdity of it. They look at each
other, the circumstances, this choice they’ve made. He
hungrily kisses her. And as they fuck in the old wine colored
convertible Citroen in the middle of the overgrown field...


EXT. FARMHOUSE, CHANTILLY - NIGHT

The farmhouse lit against the dark countryside. There’s the
sound of a TYPEWRITER.
                                                        49.


INT. THE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

A bottle of wine is on a table...and Joanna having found an
old typewriter is typing on a piece of paper...some few pages
she’s already done in a beginning pile...

                    JOANNA
          The “e” and the “t” is broken.

                    MACKENSIE (OVER)
          Try to write without using them.

She smiles at the impossibility of that.

                    JOANNA
              (enthusiastic)
          I have a book idea in mind...I haven’t
          had that in quite awhile.

Enjoying the classic nature of the typewriter...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
              (as she types)
          It makes me feel like a real writer...

A CAT comes in the window walking across her typewriter. She
starts, chasing it away. The cat racing back out. She settles
going back to writing. There’s a sound of him on the stairs.

                    MACKENSIE (OVER)
              (suddenly)
          Don’t move!

She turns and sees he has found an old but deadly looking
shotgun. And he’s leveling it at her...

                    JOANNA
          Please don’t point that at me...

He raises it, to demonstrate...

                    MACKENSIE
          Don’t worry, it’s empty...

He pulls the trigger and the gun EXPLODES with a deafening
roar blowing a hole in the ceiling.


EXT./INT. CENTRE GEORGES POMPIDOU MUSEUM RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The distinctive Centre building. We see Mr. Lime through a
window, sitting at a window, in their most elegant of
restaurants, eating steak fritte, surrounded by the great art
in the Pompidou Centre. His phone sounds. He opens a text.
                                                           50.


There’s a SECURITY PHOTOGRAPH OF MACKENSIE WITH JOANNA
DRIVING THE PEUGEOT OUT OF A RENTAL AGENCY. He shuts his
phone, and getting up...


INT. FRENCH FARMHOUSE, CHANTILLY - LATE AT NIGHT

Mackensie asleep in bed. He senses Joanna isn’t there. He
comes down the stairs.

                    JOANNA
          I couldn’t sleep...it’s too quiet...
              (after a beat)
          Do you think they’ll find us here?

He doesn’t say anything which is her answer. When ABRUPTLY
the farmhouse DOOR BURSTS OPEN. They virtually jump up. And
they see two armed GENDARMES have come bursting through the
door. They motion them not to move.

                    GENDARME
              (French)
          What are you doing here?! The
          neighbors are saying the house is
          supposed to be empty.

                    JOANNA
          He wants to know what we are doing
          here?

                    MACKENSIE
              (calmly)
          Tell them it’s my sister’s house...
          Carol Watson...

She tells them. The Gendarmes confer...One goes outside...He
returns...confirms...

                    GENDARME
              (French)
          It is owned by the Watsons...How long
          do you plan to stay?

He glances to Joanna...

                    MACKENSIE
              (in French)
          Not long.

They accept that, leaving...They’re quiet, well aware they
are on borrowed time. And if they needed a reminder her watch
“DINGS.”
                                                           51.


                    JOANNA
          Eighteen days.


EXT. CHANTILLY - DAY

We see the Peugeot parked on a street in the beautiful and
timeless Chantilly. Joanna getting out of the car, her hair
stuffed up under a broad brimmed farm sun hat as best as
possible hiding her face. She crosses into a Boulangerie.


INT. BAKERY, CHANTILLY - DAY

It’s empty. A young woman baker in an apron who is very, what
is the best word, fetching? (In French seduisante, enticing),
different than attractive, someone by her secretive demeanor
makes you want to know much more about her. In her late
twenties with a number of curious tattoos that on her pale
skin make you drawn to want to touch them; who has a constant
enigmatic smile as if waiting to be surprised, is taking some
bread out of the oven. Seeing Joanna, and there is an
immediate glint she is attracted to her...

                    THE WOMAN
              (in French, subtitles)
          There is nothing like the taste of
          fresh bread the moment it comes out of
          the oven.

And without being asked she tears off a piece, literally
putting it into Joanna’s mouth.

                    JOANNA
              (fending with, in French,
               subtitles)
          It’s hot...

And they will exclusively speak in French with subtitles:

                    THE WOMAN
              (a laugh)
          Of course, you know just what you are
          getting. It is supposed to awaken your
          senses.

                    JOANNA
              (laughs)
          It did that.

They smile at one another.

                       THE WOMAN
          I’m Lilou.
                                                         52.


                    JOANNA
              (English)
          A lily.

Lilou shows her a tattoo of just that on her shoulder.

                    LILOU
          My birth name was Charlotte...they
          wanted a boy to name Charles. I picked
          Lilou when I was five. It stayed.

                    JOANNA
          I’m Joanna.

Lilou shakes her hand.

                    LILOU
          Are you here just visiting or staying
          for awhile?

                    JOANNA
          Staying for a short while.

                    LILOU
              (smart)
          Are you the couple staying at the
          Watsons’?

Joanna nods...

                    JOANNA
              (protective)
          We don’t want --

                    LILOU
          I understand...He must be special.
              (smiles)
          I can be trusted.

Joanna doesn’t say anything.

                    LILOU (CONT’D)
          That was such a sad story.

                       JOANNA
          Sad story?

                    LILOU
          The Watsons. Her husband’s cancer. And
          ending like that so... (searches for
          the word) “softly.” They were quite in
          love. He told me he didn’t want her to
          have to suffer through his death so he
          went away for the end...
                                                        53.


                    JOANNA
              (shaken)
          Yes, it’s just terrible.

                    LILOU
          The house has been empty for such a
          long time. She loved sunflowers, she
          had a beautiful field of sunflowers.
          What do you folks do?

                    JOANNA
          I work for an interior design
          magazine. My friend sells
          international real estate.

                    LILOU
              (knowingly)
          New Yorkers.

                    JOANNA
              (her smile)
          We’re easy to spot.

                       LILOU
          Excuse me.

She buttons an open button on Joanna’s blouse.

                    LILOU (CONT’D)
              (smiles)
          You came undone.

She smooths her blouse down for her. Joanna isn’t used to
women touching her, but doesn’t dislike how it feels.

                    JOANNA
              (remembering her purpose)
          I would like a loaf of bread...and
          where can I get some small groceries?

Putting it in a bag Lilou gives her the fresh loaf of bread.

                    LILOU
              (her smile)
          This I made for you.

                    JOANNA
          I couldn’t,

                    LILOU
              (her way, a seductive
               smile)
          You have no choice.
                                                        54.


INT. A FRENCH RESTAURANT, PARIS - DAY

Mr. Lime eating a fancy omelet in a famous French breakfast
restaurant with a chicken motif, chicken figurines, chicken
drawings and paintings...chickens everywhere...His phone
“Dings.” He looks at a text where there is a SECURITY CAMERA
PHOTOGRAPH of Joanna getting out of the Peugeot on the
Chantilly Street. He expands it to see it says “Chantilly,”
on a store behind her. As he finishes his omelet among all
the chickens:


INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Joanna coming into the farmhouse with the bread and a couple
of bags of groceries. He comes to help her...

                    MACKENSIE
          How did you do? Was anybody interested
          who you were?

                    JOANNA
              (turns on him, furious)
          Do you even have a sister?!

He doesn’t say anything.

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
              (livid at his lying)
          The people who own this...you killed
          her husband!

He doesn’t say anything again...she slaps him...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          Don’t fucking lie to me anymore...!

He grabs her, holding her arms...

                    MACKENSIE
          She is in St. Louis...I knew she would
          never return here...

                    JOANNA
              (needs to know)
          How did you kill him?

                    MACKENSIE
          In the immortal Sagrada Familia church
          in Barcelona. He went to visit the
          Church designed by God through his
          architect Gaudi, for a last time. His
          wife was taking a tour of the church.
          He was alone. He was crying.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT'D)
          I offered him compassion. I hugged him
          and held him.


INT. THE SAGRADA FAMILIA, BARCELONA - DAY

We see Mackensie compassionately hugging a dying man in a pew
in the immortal church.

                    MACKENSIE (OVER)
          I gave him a nasal spray that is
          painless and immediate...

AND WE SEE HIM QUICKLY SEND A SPRAY UP THE MAN’S NOSE...THE
MAN FOLDING OVER...MACKENSIE, DESPITE THE THRONGS OF PEOPLE
UNAWARE OF THE UNFOLDING STORY, LYING HIM PEACEFULLY ON THE
CHURCH BENCH, SILENTLY LEAVING...THE SACRED UMBER LIGHT
COMING THROUGH THE STAINED GLASS ONTO THE MAN LYING ON THE
BENCH AMONG ALL THE TOURISTS ALONE WITH HIS GOD.


INT. FARMHOUSE, CHANTILLY - DAY

She looks at him...A man apart...in many ways quicksilver,
unattainable...and her watch “BINGS”...

                    JOANNA
              (ominous)
          Seventeen days.

And despite how unattainable he is...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          There is fresh bread.


EXT. A ROAD IN FRANCE - NIGHT

We see Mr. Lime sitting in an immaculate most modern Mercedes
in a Crepes Restaurant parking lot, eating a strawberry
crepe.


EXT. THE FARMHOUSE, CHANTILLY - NIGHT

The lights on in the old Farmhouse. The sound of Joanna
TYPING.


INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Joanna busy writing. Mackensie making a fire.
                                                        56.


                    MACKENSIE
          What’s it about?

                    JOANNA
          A woman in distress.

                    MACKENSIE
          Your books are always about women in
          distress.

                    JOANNA
          Either you write what you know or what
          scares you. This is both.

                    MACKENSIE
          Is it about our situation, about us?

She doesn’t say anything.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          How does it end?

Before she can answer him there’s a startling KNOCK on the
door. They both go still. Mackensie takes up the poker, goes
to the door. He hesitates and poker ready answers the door.
And LILOU, hands full with a fresh loaf of bread, a bottle of
wine, a small bag of groceries, and a bouquet of sunflowers
is standing there.

                    LILOU
              (in French, subtitles)
          I’m Lilou. I met Joanna today. I
          wanted to welcome you.

                    MACKENSIE
          My French is very poor.

                    JOANNA
          She wanted to welcome us.

There’s an awkward moment...while he helps her in.

                    MACKENSIE
              (to Joanna, a hint of
               anger)
          You didn’t mention you met someone?

                    JOANNA
          She owns the bakery.

Mackensie nods but is far from fine with it...
                                                        57.


                    LILOU
          My English is not so very good... How
          do you say it, I am always one word
          before the other...?

But as all French women who don’t speak English it is
delightful...

                    MACKENSIE
              (charmed)
          You say the wrong word...

                    LILOU
          That is it...Can I put this
          somewhere...?

Joanna comes to help her put her things down...

                    LILOU (CONT’D)
              (in French, subtitles)
          I’m sorry not to have called but there
          is no more a phone here. I thought
          maybe you wouldn’t mind some company.

                    JOANNA
              (in French, subtitles)
          It’s nice to have you.

Mackensie understanding the tone and enough French.

                    MACKENSIE
              (despite everything)
          Make yourself at home.

                    LILOU
          What is this, “Make yourself at home?”

                    JOANNA
              (smiles, in French,
               subtitles)
          Our home is your home...

Lilou smiles her fetching smile.

                    LILOU
              (in French, subtitles)
          Have you eaten? I have some special
          moules.

As he looks at Joanna.
                                                          58.


EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD IN FRANCE - NIGHT

The Mercedes going by.


INT. MR. LIME’S MERCEDES - NIGHT

Mr. Lime listening to oddly blues music driving along a
French country road...a sign saying “Chantilly, 10 km.”


INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

A radio is playing music. Lilou and Joanna drinking wine,
making dinner...the two of them enjoying cooking together...
Lilou seductively puts an appetizer to taste in Joanna’s
mouth...They laugh...When a stray CAT jumps in the window
onto the counter eating an appetizer...Joanna starts...

                    JOANNA
              (French, subtitles)
          Cats terrify me...

Lilou latches onto her, holding her, comforting her...

                    LILOU
              (French, subtitles)
          They terrify me too...

Mackensie chases the cat...The women laugh at their fears...
they go back to making the dinner enjoying each other’s
company...Mackensie, forgotten, standing drinking some wine,
looks closer at Lilou as she and Joanna happily cook
together, something about her catches him...he “puts” it
away...and trying to be helpful, he cuts the bread. He slices
his finger...his finger bleeding onto the bread, his blood
seeping into the bread turning it a malevolent doughy red...

                    JOANNA
          That’s not good...

Lilou says something in French...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          She said you are jealous...

Joanna laughs at the insanity of it all. As she takes his
hand, putting his finger under the faucet, blood running on
the white porcelain sink...Something is rotten in the state
of Denmark children...
                                                        59.


INT. FRENCH FARMHOUSE, CHANTILLY - NIGHT

They’re eating bowls of moules...the mussels...seeped in
butter and garlic...Lilou sopping up the sauce in some
bread...putting it seductively into Joanna’s mouth...Joanna
does the same with her...Lilou gets up to bring them some
more wine...

                    MACKENSIE
              (to Joanna, well aware)
          Is this what you want?

                    JOANNA
          Want?

                    MACKENSIE
          Don’t play naive. She is a lesbian and
          very interested in you.

                    JOANNA
          I like her. I’m not a lesbian.

                     MACKENSIE
              (nods)
          Would it interest you?

                    JOANNA
              (a beat)
          I’ve never done it before. I told you,
          if this is it, I want to try
          everything. You agreed to that.

He nods, he did.

                    MACKENSIE
          I still have feelings.

                    JOANNA
          I’m sorry. It isn’t about your
          feelings.

They look at each other. Lilou comes back filling their wine
glasses, and feeling she’s interrupted something...

                    LILOU
              (not understanding)
          Is something (meaning wrong) right?

                    JOANNA
          No. It’s just right.
                                                        60.


EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Mackensie standing just off the porch watching two cats drink
from a bowl of milk he has brought them; the sky blanketed
with stars in the unknowable night. And we hear the soft
sounds of the women from an upstairs window...As he walks
off, dealing with his feelings...


INT. THE FARMHOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Mackensie alone in bed in their dark room...and we see Joanna
climbing into bed with him...There’s the SOUND of the
farmhouse door closing, Lilou leaving. Mackensie and Joanna
in bed laying back to back.

                     JOANNA
          You are not allowed to ask. This was
          just mine.

He nods. They’re quiet. After some moments:

                    MACKENSIE
          There is something about her I don’t
          trust. (what he saw) Did you notice
          for someone who is afraid of cats she
          has a tattoo of one.

                    JOANNA
              (dismisses it, smiles)
          You are jealous.

His silence gives him away, he is jealous, and how much he
has grown to care about her.

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
              (and sensitive to him)
          Would you like to make love?

                       MACKENSIE
                 (without us seeing, but we
                  can imagine his smile...)
          Oui.


EXT. CHANTILLY - LATE NIGHT

We can see Lilou getting out of her car coming home. She goes
into her boulangerie.
                                                          61.


INT. LILOU’S BOULANGERIE - LATE NIGHT

She goes upstairs to her apartment over the bakery. She
unlocks the door, goes inside.


INT. LILOU’S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

She stops. And Mr. Lime, sitting in a living room chair, his
deadly pen in his hand, but being used as a pen now, is
writing something in a tiny notebook he keeps, waiting for
her.

                     LILOU
              (calmly but forceful, and
               without fear...)
          Excuse me?

                    MR. LIME
              (busy writing)
          I’m Mr. Lime. I understand we will be
          working together.

He finishes what he is writing and puts his tiny notebook
back inside his coat pocket and capping the pen puts it into
his shirt pocket. And a cat of hers jumps onto his lap. He
quietly strokes it. If we had any doubts about her we don’t
have any, anymore.

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          I don’t usually work with anyone else.

He sees some folders, even a copy of Joanna’s book, “Girl Up
A Tree,” with the cat stuck up the tree on the cover.

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          You’ve done your homework.

She doesn’t say anything. He stands out of the chair, the cat
running off. He barely looks at Lilou. Buttons his coat.

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          This should be over rather quickly.

Finishing the buttons...

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          Is there anything open late that might
          have something worth eating?
                                                        62.


INT. LILOU’S APARTMENT - LATE AT NIGHT

Lilou stands at the window looking outside, watching Mr. Lime
in his distinctive hat crossing the street in the misty night
air and walking off along the block.


EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - MORNING

Mackensie is standing by the Peugeot as Joanna prepares to
drive off.

                    MACKENSIE
          I don’t think you are being very
          smart.

                    JOANNA
          I’m just getting some bread...

He gives her a look...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
              (truthful)
          She captured something of me...

He nods, trying to accept that...

                    MACKENSIE
              (his last admonition)
          If something goes wrong, get to
          Chantilly...

And concerned, he watches her drive away.


EXT. THE BAKERY, CHANTILLY - MORNING

Joanna, unsuspecting, buoyant, taken with her, hurries into
the street to see her.


INT. LILOU’S BOULANGERIE - MORNING

Some people are getting their daily bread, a large old hearth
type bread oven cooking racks of bread...Lilou sees Joanna,
gives her a secret smile. She hurries through the customers.
The moment the shop is empty she turns the sign to Closed,
“Fermee.” And the two of them alone fall into each other’s
arms, kissing. Lilou takes her by the hand, going out of the
shop and holding hands up the stairs.
                                                        63.


INT. LILOU'S APARTMENT - MORNING

They lay onto the bed passionately kissing. Lilou turns her
over onto her stomach, kissing Joanna’s neck, her back...
Joanna in the throes of passion when she sees a cat’s dish of
milk under a nearby table. And everything seems terribly
wrong. She stiffens.

                    LILOU
              (kissing her, French,
               subtitles)
          Do I do something wrong?

                    JOANNA
              (French, subtitles)
          No. I need to use the water closet.

She goes into the bathroom.


INT. BATHROOM, LILOU’S - MORNING

She looks around her...She tries to open the window, it’s
stuck.

                    LILOU (OVER)
              (French, subtitles)
          Is everything alright?

                    JOANNA
          Oui.

She sees a razor. She takes the blade out...secrets in her
hand...She comes out of the bathroom.

                    LILOU
          Would you want to take a shower?

                    JOANNA
          I’m not feeling very well...I need to
          go back and lay down...I’m sure I’ll
          be better later...I’ll come back...

Lilou nods. Joanna starts out the door...when Lilou sees the
cat’s milk bowl and realizes her “cover” is blown...And as
Joanna is on her way out...Lilou suddenly grabs her around
the neck, pulling her back inside, closing the door...Joanna
fingers the razor blade slicing at her arms...Lilou grabs up
a hammer...and despite being cut up hits Joanna with the
hammer in the chest, knocking her down...and straddling her
is about to crush her skull when the door bursts open and
Mackensie is there...he pulls Lilou off of her...Lilou
hitting him with the hammer knocking him backwards...Joanna
scrambles to her feet...
                                                          64.


                    MACKENSIE
              (trying to fend Lilou off;
               to Joanna, says again)
          Go to Chantilly...! You’ll be safe
          there...

Joanna hesitates but listening to him scrambles out the door
running down the stairs...Lilou and Mackensie wrestling for
the hammer, literally bursting out the door...Lilou far
tougher than one would imagine, hammering at him, the two
going over, Mackensie trying to fend her off as they roll
down the stairs...She manages to get to her feet, running
into the bakery shop. He comes after her...she grabs up a
deadly bread knife...she literally sinks it into his upper
chest by his shoulder...he manages to keep his balance, her
hand on the knife trying to bury it deeper into him, him
trying to fight her off...when he manages to gather the last
bit of his strength and rushing her literally pushes her into
the bread oven...slamming the hearth’s metal door...I don’t
want to sicken you by the obvious sounds she makes but assume
whatever she yells is in French. He extricates the knife.

He stumbles out of the shop leaving a trail of blood...


EXT. CHANTILLY TOWN - DAY

He moves as best he can along the street, the trail of blood
following him...people afraid giving him wide shrift...as he
stumbles to the Citroen...starts the car and races away...


INT. THE CITROEN, ON THE ROAD - DAY

Driving with his one good arm...a pool of blood on the floor
at his feet...


EXT. THE FRENCH ROAD - DAY

The wine colored car racing along the road.


INT. THE CITROEN - DAY

Up ahead he sees a particular sign that says “Chantilly.” He
pulls into a parking lot crowded with cars. He gets out.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

There is the muffled sound of something being announced. He
makes his way toward the entrance.
                                                         65.


And as he gets closer we realize that this is, the stables
built in 1720 in the reign of Louis XV, and the racecourse
from the 1850s, THE ELEGANT AND BEAUTIFUL GRANDSTAND AND
CHANTILLY RACETRACK.


EXT. CHANTILLY RACETRACK - DAY

He comes outside onto the apron of the crowded racetrack. A
race is running. He takes an escalator upstairs. He looks
from the second deck down on the track looking for
Joanna...As he moves along the stands looking for her...


EXT. CHANTILLY RACETRACK - DAY

We see Mr. Lime approaching the entrance. And we see on his
phone is a Security Camera photograph of Joanna going into
the track.


EXT. CHANTILLY RACETRACK - DAY

When we see Joanna, down on the apron among the crowd,
looking everywhere for Mackensie.


EXT. GRANDSTAND, RACETRACK - DAY

Mackensie, drops of blood at his feet, looking for Joanna.


EXT. THIRD LEVEL, GRANDSTAND, RACETRACK - DAY

Mr. Lime, looking through small but powerful binoculars down
at the people. WE SEE what he sees, moving across the
people’s faces, looking for Joanna. And then, we see her
through his binoculars. He stops. He takes his eye away.
Joanna down below him on the apron in the middle of the
crowd. He gets on an escalator going down.


EXT. RACETRACK - DAY

Joanna looking all around...


EXT. THE RACETRACK - DAY

And Mackensie sees her...he moves as quickly as he can to the
escalator...he looks around him...and he sees just behind him
on the escalator above him is Mr. Lime. He pushes past people
hurrying down the escalator. Mr. Lime sees him.
                                                        66.


He pushes past people on his own...Mackensie reaches the
apron...he goes running for Joanna...Mr. Lime, taking out his
pen, reconfiguring the pen into its deadly pistol, coming
steadily after them...Mackensie makes it to her and without a
moment’s hesitation grabs her...moving her through the
crowd...Another RACE has begun...the crowd caught up in the
race...while they hurry through the crowd, Mr. Lime just
after them...He stops, fingering the lethal trigger, aiming
it...he has them clear in his sights running from him...He
fires...the pistol’s retort a deadly sneeze in the sound of
the crowd...He’s come up just short, the bullets ricocheting
off the concrete after them...They look back...He aims to
fire again...When Mackensie suddenly ducks with her under a
railing...and they literally run onto the TRACK...


EXT. THE TRACK, CHANTILLY - DAY

The horses thundering down toward the finish line...They run
across the track...Mackensie pulling her right into the path
of the oncoming horses, causing chaos, jockeys fighting to
avoid them...While they just make it through the equine
gauntlet...Mr. Lime watching them get to the other
side...Where we are running with them into a large open grass
field...and as they just keep on running, and running, and
running away...

WHEN WE SEE A SMALL COMMUTER PLANE SUDDENLY LANDING.


EXT. A PLANE LANDING IN CORSICA - DAY

A small plane landing at FIGARI, SUD CORSE, the small bump of
an Airfield on the Mediterranean Island.


EXT. FIGARI, SUD CORSE AIRFIELD, CORSICA - DAY

The plane taxiing to a stop. Some fourteen people, Joanna and
Mackensie among them, coming down the stairs of a small
plane, going into the tired terminal.


INT. THE TERMINAL, FIGARI AIRPORT, CORSICA - DAY

Nothing much more than a gate with a small waiting area and
one large customs room. Mackensie is well aware of the
Security Cameras as they go into the customs hall. They come
through customs.

                    CUSTOMS OFFICIAL

                       MACKENSIE
          Two weeks.

She looks at him as if to say, “We are?” As he stamps their
passports:


EXT. BONIFACIO, CORSICA - DAY

They carry their luggage up a hill of the small town
overlooking the sea.


INT. A SMALL CORSICAN HOTEL - DAY

They check into a small hotel.


INT. SMALL HOTEL, THEIR ROOM - DAY

Mackensie, his shirt off, his shoulder heavily bandaged, is
standing on their small patio looking out at the sea. She
comes outside beside him.

                    MACKENSIE
          If we can disappear for two and a half
          weeks it will be over. The two things
          they do are either enforce their
          contracts, or honor them...

                    JOANNA
          How many people who have changed their
          minds have -- ?

He doesn’t answer her which is the answer...And as if on cue
her watch “BINGS.”

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
              (ominous)
          Sixteen days.
              (after a beat)
                    (MORE)
                                                          68.

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          Disappear for two weeks? How do we do
          that?


EXT. BONIFACIO, HARBOR, CORSICA - DAY

The busy harbor. Signs advertising: “Boats For Charter,
Daily, Weekly...” And we see Mackensie with Joanna on the
deck of a solid SAILBOAT...Mackensie talking to a Captain...
they shake hands...the Captain going into the wheelhouse...

                    MACKENSIE
          You know how to sail?

                    JOANNA
          I wrote about it once.

As she shakes “no”:

                    MACKENSIE
          That makes two of us.

She hesitates...and as he smiles his smile he is playing with
her...


EXT. THE MEDITERRANEAN, CORSICA - DAY

And we see that once the SAILBOAT is out of the   harbor,
Mackensie, an adept sailor, is busy setting the   sails...the
boat taking on wind picking up speed, going out   to sea.
Joanna watching him, graceful, athletic, moving   around the
boat, maneuvering the ropes, the sails, between   handling the
wheel, keeping their course...

She looks over at Mackensie at the wheel...

                    JOANNA
          Where’d you learn to sail?

                    MACKENSIE
          After my wife died I spent six months
          alone on the sea.

She looks at him...

                    JOANNA
          How do I know that’s true?

                    MACKENSIE
          Does it really matter? As long as I
          can get us from here to there...
                                                        69.


She continues to wonder just who she has signed on with...a
loving husband or an assassin or both?

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
              (throwing her a rope)
          Hold onto this until I yell...

She holds the rope as he raises another sail...

                       MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          Let it go!

She lets the rope go and as a large sail unfurls, the
sailboat cutting through the water; Joanna breathing the air,
wind blowing across her...She embraces herself, no matter the
circumstances, feeling for the first time in quite a long
time, alive...


EXT. A COVE, CORSICA - DAY

The sailboat anchored in a secluded island cove...Joanna and
Mackensie bobbing in the deep blue Mediterranean...She swims
over to him. As he pushes back her wet hair and they hold
onto each other in the water, knowing all they have is each
other...hungrily, almost fearfully, kissing...


EXT. THE MEDITERRANEAN - DAY

We see from a distance Mackensie rowing Joanna in a wooden
dinghy to a small island...


EXT. AN ISLAND OFF CORSICA - DAY

They walk along a goat path on an abandoned island...

                    JOANNA
          ...It was said Cleopatra secretly met
          with Mark Antony here...

She motions...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          Their boats were on either side of the
          island...She came up one way...he came
          the other...

And from Joanna as an author’s point of view WE SEE:
                                                           70.


CLEOPATRA IN ALL HER GLORY, BUT JUST A WOMAN HERE, AND MARK
ANTONY, THE RELUCTANT WARRIOR, HAVING COME UP SEPARATE PATHS
ONTO THE ISLAND, THE STAR CROSSED LOVERS SEEING EACH OTHER,
COMING TOGETHER...WALKING A GOAT TRAIL, TALKING... DESPITE
THE WORLD ON THEIR SHOULDERS JUST MORTALS ON THIS COIL...

TIME LAPSE to Joanna and Mackensie tracing their steps coming
to the aged remaining foundation of a wall...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          This is a fort Alexander the Great
          built three thousand years ago...

She sits down her back against the remains of a wall...
Mackensie sits beside her...A breeze, like time calling,
blows across them...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
              (taken, like a spell)
          Just imagine they may have sat right
          here...touched these stones...It’s
          hard to fathom but it wasn’t a story,
          they were real, flesh and
          blood...Maybe they laughed about
          something...maybe they talked about
          whatever their dreams were...He gave
          her as a wedding gift what is now the
          entire Middle East.

He smiles at the enormity of that. She’s quiet...The timeless
breeze ruffles their clothing...

                    MACKENSIE
          What are your dreams?

                    JOANNA
          I thought I had run out...I didn’t
          think anything was possible anymore...
              (she looks at him, for
               better or worse)
          Then I met you.

They’re still...He doesn’t look at her but he says...

                    MACKENSIE
          I love you.

She turns on him.

                    JOANNA
          Don’t say that! I don’t believe you. I
          don’t believe you about anything. You
          don’t know me.
                                                        71.


And the impact of Lilou and her death, the tenuous
circumstances they are in, under the gun, she starts to cry,
releasing her emotions...She hangs her head...He puts his arm
around her, comforting...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          As a writer you’re supposed to be able
          to live in someone else’s shoes...
          (ironic) I’m just another of my
          characters, a woman in distress...

                    MACKENSIE
          You’re far more real than that...

And as they sit where Cleopatra and Mark Antony once did, a
different kind of world on their shoulders...in this movie
called “London.”


EXT. FIGARI, SUD CORSE, AIRPORT, CORSICA - DAY

We see a plane disembarking. People coming down the commuter
plane’s mobile stairs. And among them, wearing a white linen
suit and a Mediterranean style straw hat, is the ineffable
ever-present shadow of Mr. Lime.


EXT. THE SAILBOAT IN THE COVE - NIGHT

The sky an incredible array of stars. Joanna and Mackensie
sitting on the deck, Mackensie showing her a map book.

                    MACKENSIE
          We’re here...

Charting their course...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          There are at least twelve stops we can
          make in coves like this, around the
          island, away from people, and not be
          found for the remaining time...

                    JOANNA
          I know nobody has...but...What if we
          actually run out the clock...we
          somehow make it...? What happens when
          we don’t need to escape?

                    MACKENSIE
          I try to stay with what’s in front of
          me. I haven’t made long range plans
          for a very long time.
                                                        72.


She’s quiet.

                    JOANNA
          Can you see us together?

                    MACKENSIE
          We are together.

                    JOANNA
          I mean after this?

                    MACKENSIE
              (a small smile)
          I’ll leave it to you to write the
          ending.

                    JOANNA
          Sometimes you just don’t know until
          the end.

They look at each other, neither sure of what is going to
be...And as if God wanted them to consider other things, it
starts to rain...a sudden downpour...they are completely
soaked...and as they laugh, running inside for cover...

THERE IS A MAN SINGING OPERA.


INT. A SMALL RESTAURANT, BONIFACIO, CORSICA - NIGHT

A small restaurant known for its pasta and clams. Mr. Lime
alone at a table having vongole and pasta, a bottle of wine,
bon appetit! And a waiter, another thing the restaurant is
known for, its singing waiters, is singing OPERA. There is a
small crowded bar. A group of young people in their late
twenties, crew from various boats, in their shorts and t-
shirts and sandals, talking too loud, drinking and laughing.
Amongst them, but separate, a particularly handsome couple, a
very fit and handsome man, reminiscent and as good looking as
say Tom Cruise, and an equally fit and attractive woman, come
there for the sea, are having drinks, eating octopus. There
is a burst of noise from the young people. Mr. Lime, his
meal, his peace interrupted, unhappily looks over. His eyes
meet Tom Cruise and the young woman’s...it’s brief, the young
people, along with Mr. Lime, looking away. As he returns to
his clams and pasta with the opera:


EXT. THE SAILBOAT - NIGHT

The boat in the cove in the rain squall.
                                                        73.


INT. THE SAILBOAT, BERTH - NIGHT

And Joanna and Mackensie, the rain sounding on the portholes,
making love on their boat. There is the familiar “BING”
stopping them.

                    JOANNA
          Fifteen days.

And as they go back to where they left off with, if possible,
even more urgency:


INT. LIME’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Mr. Lime in his linen suit having some fresh strawberries.
There’s a light knock on the door. He doesn’t bother to get
up but just makes a sound that it’s open. An African Woman,
an obvious professional, comes in. When we see some money has
already been left on a nearby table. Without further
conversation, or ado, he unbuttons his fly. She starts to
undress. He shakes no. She kneels to him. As he bites into a
strawberry, and I hate to do this but I have no choice not
to, and some of the strawberry’s juice runs down his chin...

WHEN WE SEE THEIR SAILBOAT CUTTING THROUGH THE WATER.


EXT. THEIR SAILBOAT ON THE MEDITERRANEAN - DAY

A pristine day. The boat moving through the water...He’s got
Joanna handling the wheel, enjoying the adventure, while
Mackensie is up a mast, swaying under his weight, releasing a
rope to free a smaller jib...He suddenly stops, seeing
something on the water...He comes scampering down the
mast...Coming to her...He motions...she looks where he is
pointing...There is a sailboat on its side, swamped...heads
bobbing in the water...He grabs the wheel making their way to
them...Getting there he sees a sailboat is capsized, and
sinking...a Man and a Woman, neither of them in life vests,
in the water...Hurrying, taking off his shirt...

                    MACKENSIE
              (telling her)
          Hold its course to make a circle...

                    JOANNA
          I can’t -- !

                    MACKENSIE
          You can...!

And he jumps with his trousers on into the water...
                                                          74.


EXT. THE MEDITERRANEAN - DAY

...as he swims to the people in the water, in distress, by
the capsized boat...We now see they are the YOUNG COUPLE FROM
THE BAR. The Tom Cruise and his partner. She is seemingly
unconscious, a nasty gash on her forehead, bleeding...He is
struggling to keep her head above water...trying to keep her
from going under...Mackensie, reaching them, grabs her from
further going under, keeping her afloat...And holding onto
her, the young man swimming alongside him, he swims her to
their boat...

                    MACKENSIE
              (yells to Joanna)
          Drop that sail...

Joanna manages to   figure out how to untie the sail...the sail
coming down...the   boat gone dead in the water...She reaches
to help the young   Man onto the boat...Mackensie struggling to
get the woman out   of the water...onto the boat...


EXT. SAILBOAT, THE SEA - DAY

Once the young woman’s safely aboard...she’s motionless...
Mackensie bends, giving her mouth to mouth...she begins
coughing, gasping for air...he sits back, catching his
breath, exhausted...The Young Man comforts his partner...
Joanna comes with a blanket for her, wrapping her in it while
she sits on the desk regaining her composure...

                    CODY
              (finding his breath)
          We don’t have much experience...I
          never sailed before...Millie sailed
          when she was younger...We decided to
          try to take a sailboat, take an
          adventure...what do you call it,
          bareboating? We tried to make a turn
          and then sail took in too much wind
          and the boat suddenly
          capsized...Millie cracked her head
          open on what are those things...those
          things you put ropes around...?

                       MACKENSIE
          A cleat...

                    CODY
              (somewhat hysterical,
               talking a mile a minute)
                    (MORE)
                                                        75.

                       CODY (CONT'D)
             ...and we were thrown into the
             water...Millie was stone-cold out...I
             did everything I could to keep her
             head out of the water...If you hadn’t
             shown up I couldn’t have held her much
             longer...she would have drowned...

And as if to emphasize things, they can see their CAPSIZED
SAILBOAT taking on water and going, with a finality, dead
under.

                       CODY (CONT’D)
             I didn’t take the insurance...

                       MACKENSIE
                 (pure Mackensie)
             That’s not good...

                       JOANNA
                 (kneeling by Millie)
             Are you alright?

She nods.

                       MILLIE
             Scared the fuck out of me...I’m eating
             breakfast and next thing I know I’m in
             the water...

                       JOANNA
             Come lay down...

She helps Millie up and taking her down below...

                       CODY
             Jesus, I’m so glad you came
             along...this coast...I guess you can
             go a long time without seeing anybody
             else...

Mackensie doesn’t say anything.

                       CODY (CONT’D)
                 (rueful)
             We should have never done this...

He sees...

                       CODY (CONT’D)
             I don’t know why, I managed to grab my
             backpack...
                 (calming)
             Americans too?
                                                        76.


                     MACKENSIE
              (nods)
          We’re on a holiday...

                    CODY
          I’m sorry we got in the way...

Mackensie nods...there’s something that isn’t sitting well
with him...some instinct...

                    CODY (CONT’D)
              (after a beat)
          The next village is just about five
          miles from here...if you didn’t mind
          us spending the night...and drop us
          off tomorrow?

                    MACKENSIE
          Of course...

                    CODY
              (gets up...grabs his
               backpack)
          I should check on her...I’m Cody...

                    MACKENSIE
              (a beat)
          Russel, Cook...

                    CODY
          What’s her name?

                    MACKENSIE
          April.

Cody starts to the stairs to go down below...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
              (off hand)
          Hey, could you lower the halyard...?

Without a moment’s thought Cody lowers the halyard and goes
below...


EXT. THE SAILBOAT - NIGHT

Cody and Millie are sitting with Joanna at the table on the
deck having some wine...When Mackensie comes up from below...

                    MACKENSIE
          You comfortable down there...I left
          some towels.
                                                        77.


                    CODY
          I can’t thank you enough, you both are
          so generous...

                    MACKENSIE
          I didn’t know if you needed this?

He gives him his backpack...Cody thanks him...Mackensie sits
down with them...pours himself a glass of wine...

                    MILLIE
          You take things for granted and it can
          be swept away in an instance...It’s so
          good to be alive...!

They reach in toasting that...When suddenly Mackensie
literally HANDCUFFS Cody and Millie’s wrists together! Joanna
starts...

                    MACKENSIE
          They were in their backpack...Along
          with this...

He shows her a familiar STINGER PISTOL PEN.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          He said he didn’t know how to sail but
          he knew right away how to lower a
          halyard! They’re “London.”
              (to the Girl)
          You’re good at “drowning.”

Neither of them say anything.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          When we were sleeping they would have
          handcuffed us...taken us up on the
          deck...

AND WE SEE JUST THAT, CODY POINTING THE PISTOL, JOANNA AND
MACKENSIE, EACH WITH THEIR HANDS CUFFED BEHIND THEM, BEING
TAKEN UP ONTO THE DECK...AND WITHOUT A MOMENT’S HESITATION
CODY AND MILLIE KICK THEM IN THE BACKS, SHOVING THEM BOTH
OVER THE RAIL AND INTO THE WATER...


INT./EXT. THE WATER - NIGHT

THEY HIT THE WATER...GOING IMMEDIATELY UNDER...HANDS
HANDCUFFED BEHIND THEM, FRANTICALLY STRUGGLING, UNABLE TO
STAY AFLOAT...DROWNING AND FLOATING DOWN INTO THE DARK SEA...
                                                        78.


THE LAST THING WE SEE IS FROM UNDER THE WATER CODY AND
MILLIE’S FACES LOOKING DOWN FROM THE BOAT INTO THEIR WATERY
GRAVE...AND RAISING THE SAILS AND EXPERTLY SAILING THE
SAILBOAT AWAY...


EXT. THE SAILBOAT - NIGHT

Cody, despite being handcuffed, and despite his boyish
handsomeness, the monster in him comes roaring out, he
suddenly violently lurches, trying to get at Mackensie...
Mackensie taking the wine bottle and without a moment’s
hesitation, hits Cory across the head...knocking him
senseless...


INT. THE SAILBOAT - NIGHT

As we see Mackensie putting Cody and Millie, handcuffed
separately now, into a boat closet...Cody, coming around...
but before he can say anything Mackensie closes and latches
the door on them...

                    MACKENSIE
              (pure him)
          Sleep well...


EXT. THE SAILBOAT - NIGHT

Mackensie comes back up onto the deck...Joanna, upset, arms
protectively folded across her chest, pacing, pacing...
Mackensie holds her, comforting her...

                    MACKENSIE
              (and knowing)
          We’re going to have company...

He hasn’t finished his thought when there’s suddenly the
blinding LIGHT from a very bright torch shone on them...so
bright they have to block the light with their hands and
can’t see who’s shining the light...There’s an all too
familiar VOICE...

                    A MAN’S VOICE (OVER)
          I should have known they wouldn’t be
          smart enough...these young people
          London sends are fairly useless...

And now we see it’s Mr. Lime on a Zodiac raft, with a
crewman, in a ship’s uniform, driving the raft...And we can
see in the moonlight a sizable BOAT, its running lights on,
is bobbing in the mouth of the cove.
                                                        79.


                    MR. LIME
              (his smile, showing his
               hands, he is unarmed)
          Permission to come aboard, Captain.

                    MACKENSIE
              (unsmiling)
          Help yourself.

Mr. Lime reaches out for a hand...Mackensie hesitates but
oddly respectful gives him his hand helping him onto the
sailboat.

                    MR. LIME
          Where have you put them?

                    MACKENSIE
          They’re resting.

Mr. Lime smiles.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          Good to see you again, Archie.

                    MR. LIME
          And you dear boy. Doc, where are your
          manners?

                    MACKENSIE
          Joanna, Archie Lime.

                    MR. LIME
          Good to meet you Ms. Dunlap. I
          particularly liked “Girl, Alone.”

                    JOANNA
              (instinctive)
          That was my first.

                    MR. LIME
          The funeral scene when they are
          burying her in the bronze casket but
          we know she is quite alive.

Joanna’s quiet.

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          I certainly knew what it felt like not
          to be able to breathe...

They’re quiet. At loggerheads.

                    MACKENSIE
          What do you intend to do, Archie?
                                                         80.


                    MR. LIME
          I remember all too well when the shoe
          was on the other foot...when I had
          that particular problem with Mrs.
          Cunningham...When I forgot
          myself...let myself get wobbly and
          soft...

Mackensie is quiet...

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          How you gave me a day of grace...a
          head start...it was very sporting of
          you, Doc...you could have ended things
          but you let time elapse for both of
          us...

                    MACKENSIE
          You couldn’t have foreseen the weather
          making the road impassible...and you
          seemed to be enjoying your meal with
          her so...

                    MR. LIME
          She was particularly charming...

                    MACKENSIE
          Whatever happened to her, given the
          second chance she had?

                    MR. LIME
              (a beat)
          I’m afraid Mrs. Cunningham met an
          unfortunate accident...she somehow
          left a train while it was moving...

Joanna’s chilled, still...

                     MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          I’m sure we see things quite
          similarly, Doc...we have committed to
          doing what we do best...and no matter,
          what may come, finishing what we
          started...

Joanna looks at Mackensie...He doesn’t say anything...

                     MR. LIME (CONT’D)
              (gracious)
          Before this gets ugly, please, make
          your way...You have a day ahead of
          me...use it well...Then, we will be...
          (and even it sounds malevolent) “Even
          Steven...”
                                                         81.


EXT. THE SAILBOAT - NIGHT

Mackensie and Joanna are in the DINGHY, pushing off...

                    MR. LIME
          The next village is just two coves
          away...You should be there in no
          time...

Mackensie looks at him, and starts to row them away...

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          I understand there is a lovely little
          restaurant there that serves freshly
          grown artichokes in a wine and garlic
          butter...

Mackensie rowing them away from the boat...And Joanna’s watch
“Bings.”

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
              (well aware...)
          Two weeks, exactly fourteen days...

And Mackensie rows them further away...Mr. Lime standing on
their sailboat deck watching them go...calling out to them...

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          Bon Voyage!


EXT. THE SEA - NIGHT

Their dinghy at a distance now...Mackensie rowing...they can
see Mr. Lime climbing back onto the Zodiac...the raft
motoring back toward the large Boat at the mouth of the
cove...when suddenly the sailboat bursts into flame, the
sailboat on fire...Mr. Lime having started the boat ablaze...
and we can either be macabre and see the Young Man and his
partner trapped in the closet and see the horrible fate that
awaits them...or we can just as well watch from Mackensie’s
and Joanna’s point of view the sailboat in the dark on the
water engulfed by the conflagration and leave to the
imagination what awaits them...Mr. Lime on the Zodiac on his
way back to the waiting boat...and Mackensie rowing them
further and further away in the light of a Mediterranean
moon. And as if it’s an old movie from the twenties, nineteen
twenties that is, we CLOSE THE CAMERA IRIS the way they did
to show the end of a particular chapter...our iris closing on
their rowboat, the sailboat on fire, and the moon.
                                                           82.


THE CAMERA’S IRIS OPENS AS WE SEE A YOUNG BOY, NO MORE THAN
NINE, RUNNING UP A STEEP NARROW COBBLED STREET THAT’S FLANKED
BY ANCIENT STONE BUILDINGS...AS HE RUNS UP THE OLD STREET...
RUNNING FOR ALL HIS MIGHT...JOANNA’S WATCH “BINGS...”

                    JOANNA’S VOICE (OVER)
          Thirteen days left... (and “Bings”
          again) Twelve days... (and again)
          Eleven days (and finally, “Bing,”) Ten
          days left...

When the little Boy comes to a gate at a forlorn looking old
stone house with a rocky front yard...HE RINGS A BELL...

Some moments and a Woman in a full hijab, a black burka, and
a niqab covering all but her eyes comes to open the gate. The
Boy follows her into the old stone house. And we stop to see
just where we are from the top of the hill...Overlooking the
Mount of Olives, the Dome of the Rock with its Golden Dome,
the Tower of David, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre...It
could only be...

“Jerusalem.”


INT. OLD STONE HOUSE, EAST JERUSALEM - DAY

The Woman says something to the Boy in Arabic along with
giving him a list...

                    THE WOMAN
              (Arabic, subtitles)
          Don’t forget the eggs this time...

He nods yes and immediately goes running back out...A moment
and Mackensie comes down the stairs...the Woman in the full
burka pulls back her head covering...and we see it’s Joanna.

Looking around we see they have been here for some time
without leaving...dirty dishes in the sink and the most
recent ones still on the table...the trash all but filled...
everything we can see is well lived in...her computer on a
table in the living room open to a new chapter in her book
she is writing...As she looks out the window watching the Boy
running back down the narrow street:


EXT. A LONDON SUBURB - NIGHT

A neighborhood of small well-kept “Victorian” style cottages
one after the other the very same.
                                                        83.


INT. A SUBURBAN COTTAGE - NIGHT

A WOMAN in her late sixties trying to stay younger than she
is, but despite her imagined blonde hair, a rouge or three,
she is fighting a losing battle and she knows it, and
fighting the fight is drinking her third daily wine...And now
we see Mr. Lime, some years younger than her, still quite in
love with her, busy cooking an elaborate meal featuring
veal...

                    MR. LIME
          What temperature would you like it,
          (and he calls her, always has...)
          Mommy? They say just into well done
          but still in its juice has the most
          taste.

                    MR. LIME’S WIFE
          I’ll trust you Daddy.

When the doorbell RINGS.

                    MR. LIME
          Stay put, sweetheart.

He goes to see who it is. Opening the door, a very plain man
trying to look comfortable in outdoor wear is there...A car
idling at the curb with a Woman and a Boy and Girl inside...

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          Oh look, it’s Henry dear.

                    HENRY
          Hello, Celia...

                    CELIA
              (any excuse)
          Do you have time for a wine? We can
          start a fresh bottle.

                    HENRY
          We’re on our way to Potato’s cello
          recital.

                    CELIA
          How lovely.

                    HENRY
              (to Mr. Lime, his purpose,
               sotto voce...)
          Those friends seemed to have gone and
          disappeared...not a sight of them
          neither hide nor hare...
                    (MORE)
                                                          84.

                    HENRY (CONT'D)
          they seem to have learned how to avoid
          the many eyes...they were last seen on
          a ferry to Cyprus...

                    MR. LIME
              (nods, not worried, sure)
          They’ll turn up in due time...

                    HENRY
          What is it, ten days left...?

                    MR. LIME
              (looking)
          Almost nine to be precise...
              (unconcerned)
          Give little Potato my best
          wishes...and tell her when playing
          doubles to remember to play
          ponticello...

                    HENRY
          I will...Have a good evening...

And he turns going back down the path to his car...Mr. Lime
going back inside...

                    MR. LIME
          How would music suit, darling?

                    CELIA
          That would be lovely.

He turns on the radio, something forgettable...and as he goes
back to his cooking a doting husband and kindly family man, a
killer by any other name...


EXT. THEIR HOUSE ON THE HILL OVERLOOKING JERUSALEM -
NIGHTFALL

The old stone house...And minarets around Jerusalem start
calling the faithful to evening prayer.


INT. THEIR JERUSALEM HOUSE - NIGHTFALL

Joanna busy writing on her computer...Mackensie looking
outside...

                    MACKENSIE
          You want to get some air?

She nods, getting up. Fixing her hijab they go outside.
                                                        85.


EXT. JERUSALEM HOUSE - NIGHTFALL

The sounds of the muezzins calling...They cross the rocky
yard to an old stone minaret that’s on their property...


INT. MINARET - NIGHTFALL

They climb the narrow stairs to the top...coming out onto a
platform...they stop to look out over Jerusalem. The Muezzins
talking to one another...She studies him...

                    JOANNA
              (knowing)
          Even if we can beat the clock...get
          away...you are still going to finish
          your job, aren’t you?

                    MACKENSIE
          Why do you say that?

                    JOANNA
          He threw the woman off a train, rather
          than change his life.

                    MACKENSIE
          What else can I do to show you how I
          love you? I can’t imagine what it
          would be like without you.

She looks at him, unable to give herself completely to him...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          Why can’t you take me for who I am?

                    JOANNA
          Because I don’t know who you are. I
          can only take you for who you appear
          to be.

                    MACKENSIE
          There is nothing I can do to convince
          you.

                    JOANNA
              (simply)
          Time will tell.

And chilled by the coming of the night air she cradles her
arms across her chest. When their Muezzin sounds playing from
a loudspeaker above them on the Minaret, answering the other
calls to prayer...The sound among all the unseen others
echoing across Jerusalem. And they hear VOICES from a yard of
a house a half block away from them.
                                                        86.


And when the Muezzin’s calls have stopped they can see an
Arab wedding ceremony is beginning in the yard of the nearby
house. They watch the unheard ceremony.

                       JOANNA (CONT’D)
                 (ruminating)
             Each of the times I got married I
             thought it was forever.

                       MACKENSIE
             You’re supposed to feel that way. Why
             get married otherwise?

                       JOANNA
             You were so devoted to her? I only
             felt devotion the one time to the
             wrong man. It’s a hard price to pay.

                       MACKENSIE
             She was always there for me.

                       JOANNA
             Were you always there for her?

He shakes “no.”

                       MACKENSIE
             I was always trying to find myself.

He starts to say something, but stops...

                        JOANNA
                  (intuitive)
             You found yourself doing this, didn’t
             you?

                       MACKENSIE
                 (honest)
             It gave me a purpose.

He shrugs.

                       MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
             I could be anyone I wanted to be... a
             surgeon or a pilot or a gambler or a
             boxer...but I always knew who I was.

                       JOANNA
             That isn’t exactly encouraging...

He looks at her...
                                                        87.


                    MACKENSIE
          Maybe other things are becoming more
          important...?

                    JOANNA
              (quiet)
          I would like to believe that...

When there is the sudden sound of MUSIC...a band is playing
at the wedding...people enjoying dancing...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
              (smiles...)
          I never danced at a wedding...even my
          own...I was always the girl with two
          left feet...

They watch the people down in the yard of the house dancing a
traditional dance...He purposefully starts down the steps of
the minaret...without looking back, expecting her to follow:

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          Where are we going?


EXT. THE EAST JERUSALEM STREET - NIGHTFALL

And we see Mackensie, despite her protestations, hidden in
her burka, hurrying Joanna along the street...They come to
the wedding house...people overflowing standing around
outside the house in the street drinking and celebrating...
people coming and going...and without letting her have a
moment to flee he takes her into the house...


INT. EAST JERUSALEM ARAB HOME - NIGHTFALL

It’s filled with people, nobody paying any attention to them,
just more guests...He takes her outside to the back of the
house...


EXT. THE EAST JERUSALEM ARAB HOME - NIGHTFALL

Lights have come on...the people pressed together happily
dancing to the band...And Mackensie takes her by the arm
laughing, dancing with her like the others in some wild
abandonment...she resists at first but throwing caution to
the wind joins in, kicking up her legs like the rest of
them...both of them laughing and dancing, cathartic...when
the music takes a turn, and it becomes a sweet reverie...
modern music...people dancing together...And her watch, if
they have forgotten, “Bing...”
                                                        88.


                    JOANNA
          Nine days...

Mackensie and Joanna look at each other and familiarly, even
intimately smile all they have shared...and coming together,
Mackensie holds her...dancing with her to the Beatles in
Arabic, “The Long and Winding Road...” And they kiss...as
best as I can tell you how much they truly care about each
other...if even only for now...WHEN SUDDENLY A DRUNK MAN
COMES CAREENING INTO THEM, KNOCKING THEM OVER...JOANNA GOING
DOWN HARD...MACKENSIE UNABLE TO BREAK HER FALL...HER ARM
TAKING THE BRUNT OF THE FORCE...Joanna, in great pain...He
immediately grabs her up...He runs her back through the
house...out onto the street...He sees a waiting taxi...runs
her to the cab...putting her inside...getting in with her...
and as they race off...


INT. AN ARAB HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Mackensie in the waiting room of a busy hospital waiting for
word on Joanna. While a WOMAN in her forties, well kept, but
not rich, waiting for someone, sits some chairs across from
him...Mackensie’s aware she has been looking at him,
carefully...

                    THE WOMAN
          I know you from somewhere?

                       MACKENSIE
          I’m sorry?

                    THE WOMAN
          I recognize you. I can’t put my finger
          on where I know you from?

                    MACKENSIE
          I don’t think so. I have one of those
          familiar faces.

He turns to disengage.

                     THE WOMAN
              (realizes)
          The church. At the Sagrada Familia in
          Barcelona.

                       MACKENSIE
          Excuse me?

                    THE WOMAN
          You were sitting by my husband in a
          pew in the church. You must have been
          the last person to see him alive.
                                                        89.


He computes this very quickly and his response is...

                    MACKENSIE
          I was there...There was a man I spoke
          to briefly...Something happened to
          him?

                    THE WOMAN
          He was resting from our tour. He was
          dying of cancer. Unfortunately his
          heart gave out there.

                    MACKENSIE
          How dreadful. I’m so sorry.

                    THE WOMAN
          It was quick they say and peaceful.
              (needing the connection)
          Do you remember what you talked about?
          You were his last conversation.

                    MACKENSIE
          We didn’t talk much...I remember he
          looked up and told me...

THE MAN SITTING WITH MACKENSIE IN THE CHURCH...

                    THE MAN
          The church will never be
          finished...They will always keep
          building until it reaches God.

As they look up at the ceiling building its way to heaven...


INT. THE HOSPITAL, ISRAEL - NIGHT

                    MACKENSIE
          I’m sorry about his dying. He seemed
          like a gentle man.

                    THE WOMAN
          I’m Carol Watson, I’m from
          Buffalo...My close friend Andy is
          being seen to, we’re on a Holy Land
          tour...He is a homicide detective
          there. He’s a diabetic. He forgot to
          bring enough insulin.

                    MACKENSIE
          I hope things get better.
              (a beat, and generously,
               fictionally)
                    (MORE)
                                                        90.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT'D)
          I forgot...but he did say he was
          married and what a lucky man he was to
          have you.

She’s terribly moved by that. And having told her that, and
not wanting it to go any further, he nods and goes to find
another seat.

And just then Joanna...in a wheel chair, wearing her burka,
is being wheeled out with her arm in a sling and a cast...

                    JOANNA
          I broke my arm...I told you, never
          dance with me, I have two left feet...

He looks at her sympathetically...

                    MACKENSIE
              (very aware, quietly)
          We’re too public...

He wheels her out of the hospital...


EXT. THE HOSPITAL, ISRAEL - NIGHT

They wait for a Cab. When suddenly the Woman comes hurrying
out, taking his PICTURE on her phone. He moves away but too
late...

                    CAROL WATSON
              (to Joanna)
          I’m sorry to trouble you...you seem to
          have enough troubles. Your friend...

                    JOANNA
              (smart)
          My brother...

                    CAROL WATSON
          He was the last person my husband
          saw... (to Mackensie, meaning the
          photograph) I want to remember
          you...You’re my only connection left
          to him...Could I see you again?

                    MACKENSIE
              (thinking quickly)
          I’m leaving tomorrow...My sister
          teaches at an Arab school here...

And a husky Man in his late forties, uncomfortable in casual
clothing, comes beside her...showing her he’s gotten his
insulin supplies...
                                                         91.


                    CAROL WATSON
          This is my friend Andy. This man was
          with Gregory at the very end.

                    ANDY
          Good to meet you.

Mackensie nods. A Taxi arrives...He helps Joanna inside...

                     MACKENSIE
              (to Carol, meaning her
               life)
          Good luck with everything...


INT. THE TAXI - DAY

Driving away...

                    MACKENSIE
          She was a client’s wife...I gave her
          husband some peace in the church in
          Barcelona...

Joanna is quiet, and as she looks back at the woman...

                    JOANNA
              (quietly says,
               questioning, always
               questioning)
          Peace?

...Wondering what “peace” looks like...

WHEN WE SEE A FACEBOOK PAGE...”IN MEMORY.” A PAGE DEVOTED TO
GREGORY WATSON, THE MAN WHO MET HIS MAKER AT THE CHURCH.
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIS FULL LIFE...FAMILY,
WORK AND LOVE...AND A NEWLY TAKEN PHOTOGRAPH OF MACKENSIE,
CAPTIONED, “JERUSALEM,” and...”The last person to talk with
Gregory on his way to heaven.”


INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

And WE SEE Mr. Lime is looking at Carol’s FACEBOOK PAGE with
Mackensie’s photograph on an IPAD. And we see he’s in First
Class on a crowded plane, a number of men wearing yarmulkes,
on its way to Israel. As a Flight Attendant brings him a
meal...

                    THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          You ordered the special meal...
                                                           92.


He nods...and as he puts a napkin on his lap, settling into
what he enjoys most, to eat...


INT. THEIR STONE HOUSE IN JERUSALEM - DAY

Joanna, in some pain, is sitting on a couch. Mackensie
quietly looking out the window.

                    MACKENSIE
              (urgent)
          We need to leave. That woman, that
          photograph, worries me.

And as if to add to their dilemma...her watch, “Bing...”

                    JOANNA
              (concerned)
          Eight days...

And just then the BELL sounds from the gate. Mackensie
motions her to stay there...he looks outside...the little
Arab Boy at the gate...


EXT. THE WAILING WALL, THE OLD CITY, JERUSALEM - DAY

Carol and Andy along with her tour group at the Wailing
Wall...people praying leaving their most heartfelt prayers in
notes they put into the chinks in the ancient temple wall...

                    A MAN’S VOICE (OVER)
          Mrs. Watson.

She turns...and we see Mr. Lime, wearing a yarmulke, coming
to her. He shows her an alleged identification in his wallet.

                    MR. LIME
          Alan Franklin, American Embassy...
          Security...

And he’s flattened his accent to sound completely American.

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          Can I have a word...? It won’t be a
          moment...

                    ANDY
          What’s this all about?

                    MR. LIME
          Embassy business.
                                                        93.


                    ANDY
              (showing his badge)
          I’m a policeman.

                    MR. LIME
              (nods...)
          I’m afraid we’re not in Buffalo.
              (it isn’t a question)
          Please excuse us.

He walks Carol some feet away.

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          I’m sorry to disturb you. Did you take
          this photograph?

He showers her Mackensie’s photograph from her Facebook Page.

                    CAROL WATSON
          Yes.

                    MR. LIME
          Where was that?

                    CAROL WATSON
          A hospital in East Jerusalem. His
          sister had broken her arm. My
          friend... (motioning, meaning Andy)
          needed additional insulin. I
          recognized him from the Church where
          my husband died.

                    MR. LIME
              (most interested)
          Did he say where he was staying?

                    CAROL WATSON
          No, just that he was leaving...He was
          very kind to my late husband.
              (realizing)
          I don’t even know his name.

                    MR. LIME
          He calls himself Mackensie. He is
          wanted for murder.

                    CAROL WATSON
              (blanches...)
          Murder?
                                                        94.


EXT. AN ARAB COFFEE AND HOOKAH SHOP, OLD CITY - DAY

Mr. Lime having some bitter coffee sitting with Carol at a
small round table among a number of tables on a narrow street
in the Old City. Andy, ever present for her, sits nearby...
Mr. Lime is telling her...

                    MR. LIME
          He works for an organization that
          gives people an opportunity to end
          their lives painfully and peacefully.

                    CAROL WATSON
              (struck)
          Something like that exists?

                    MR. LIME
          Yes, it most certainly exists. I think
          anything you want badly enough and can
          afford nowadays, exists.

                    CAROL WATSON
              (digesting it, upset)
          My husband promised me he wouldn’t
          suffer...Now I know what he meant...

                    MR. LIME
          Mackensie is, despite the appearance
          of being a merciful man, a stone
          killer. We got a notice from Interpol
          he was seen here and to bring him in.
          You have no idea where he or his
          “sister” might be?

She shakes no. He nods. He’s gotten all she has to give...

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
              (finishes coffee, getting
               up)
          You’ve been very helpful. (and pure
          Lime, morose) Enjoy your stay.

And with that, and without looking back, he leaves...


INT. THEIR STONE HOUSE, EAST JERUSALEM - DAY

Mackensie is hanging up the phone.

                    MACKENSIE
          The next flight is 8:00...

He looks at his watch...
                                                           95.


                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          We should leave at five...just enough
          time to be last on the plane...


INT. A TAXI COMPANY OFFICE, EAST JERUSALEM - DAY

We see Mr. Lime is in a cluttered office looking at taxi
logs...A Palestinian Man who has been going over the logs in
Arabic with him...

                    PALESTINIAN MAN
              (reads...)
          ...9:49 P.M., two passengers...a man
          and an injured women to Makassed
          Hospital on Mount of Olives.


INT. THEIR STONE HOUSE, EAST JERUSALEM - LATE IN THE DAY

Mackensie and Joanna finishing packing, getting ready to
go...When the Muezzin starts its call echoing through
Jerusalem...


EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE WEDDING HOUSE, EAST JERUSALEM -
LATE IN THE DAY

The eternal muezzin calling out across Jerusalem...And we see
Mr. Lime, along with a thin Man in a yarmulke, coming outside
of the wedding house...

                    THE MAN
          She said someone got hurt
          dancing...they didn’t know them...

Mr. Lime, as the muezzin calls, stops to stand in the street
looking at the houses around them, sensing they’re near...


INT. THEIR STONE HOUSE, EAST JERUSALEM - LATE IN THE DAY

Mackensie hanging up the phone.

                    MACKENSIE
          It’s on the way...

And if Mackensie had bothered to look up we can just see Mr.
Lime standing on the street outside of the wedding house a
few houses away below them...
                                                        96.


EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE WEDDING HOUSE, EAST JERUSALEM -
LATE IN THE DAY

The muezzin still calling...Mr. Lime is about to leave,
starting to go back to a car the Israeli Man is getting in to
drive them...When he sees THE LITTLE BOY with their bag of
groceries running up the street...Lime, quickly reasoning...

                    MR. LIME
              (to the Israeli man,
               motioning...)
          Stop him!

The Israeli Man goes running after the Boy...and before he
can reach their stone house, just a bit further up the hill,
the Israeli Man pulls him up. Mr. Lime comes to meet them.

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          Ask him who the groceries are for,
          where is he going...?

The Israeli Man asks the Boy in Arabic. The Boy, fearful,
answers him.

                    THE ISRAELI MAN
          He said a couple in that house...

He motions at their house.

                    MR. LIME
              (a beat)
          Tell him not to say anything...or you
          will kill his father.

The Israeli Man tells him what he was told and the Boy runs
off with the groceries to bring to them. Mr. Lime looks
around him. The muezzin still SOUNDING. And we see a Taxi
coming by them, going to their house.


INT. THEIR STONE HOUSE - LATE IN THE DAY

The sound of the BELL, Mackensie seeing the little Boy
leaving the grocery bag at the door and racing back off...And
seeing the Taxi has arrived...

                    MACKENSIE
          It’s here...

He takes up their bags...and with Joanna in her burka, start
out of the house, met by the blast of the urgent SOUND of the
muezzin calling.
                                                        97.


EXT. A MINARET, EAST JERUSALEM - LATE IN THE DAY

Where we see Mr. Lime and the Israeli Man have come out onto
the balcony of a nearby Minaret. The Israeli Man is busy
sighting a SNIPER RIFLE, looking down at the yard of their
house. We see them come out the door.


EXT. THEIR STONE HOUSE, OVERLOOKING JERUSALEM - END OF DAY

The Taxi waiting...Joanna and Mackensie coming across the
yard...


EXT. THE MINARET - END OF THE DAY

He has Joanna in his sights...Mackensie right beside her...He
starts to squeeze the trigger to put an end to all of this...


EXT. THEIR YARD, EAST JERUSALEM - END OF DAY

Joanna and Mackensie a moment from their fate...when the
MUEZZIN, FINISHED WITH ITS CALL, goes DEAD SILENT...Mackensie
instinctively looks toward the Minaret and sees the Israeli
Man with the rifle...Mackensie immediately tackles Joanna
down just as the bullet intended for her screams by...He
drags her instantly behind the heavy gate...bullets riddling
the gate...Mackensie manages to open the gate and pulls her,
bullets skipping in the street, into the back of the Taxi...


EXT./INT. TAXI, STREET, EAST JERUSALEM - END OF DAY

The Taxi driver has fled, the Taxi idling...Mackensie pushes
Joanna down onto the floor, and crawls into the front seat...
sitting below the window he throws the car into gear and
pushes the accelerator with his hand...the Cab racing blindly
forward...bullets blowing out the windows...the Taxi running
over a curb, scraping across a wall...and racing down the
hill while bullets chase them...Mackensie scrambles to sit
up, and taking the wheel, driving, careens down the street...


EXT. THE MINARET, EAST JERUSALEM - END OF DAY

The Israeli Man comes running out, getting into his car...Mr.
Lime coming out shortly behind him...the car reaching him...
Mr. Lime getting in...and as they pursue the wayward Taxi...
                                                           98.


EXT. THE WALLS OF THE OLD CITY OF JERUSALEM - END OF DAY

The sun in its last gasps umber on the Holy City. They reach
the walls of the thousands of years Old City...the entrances
barricaded against cars...He abruptly stops the car...
reaching to help her out...He helps her to run toward the Old
City...running by some Israeli Soldiers down the way
patrolling with their Uzis...Running with her through a gate
into the Old Holy City. When we see not far behind them the
Israeli Man and Mr. Lime quickly getting out of their car...
The Israeli Man hurrying over to hurriedly talk,
gesticulating, to the ISRAELI SOLDIERS...Who, quick to react,
along with the Israeli Man, go running into the Old City
after them...Mr. Lime, not one to run, it isn’t dignified,
and knowing the race goes not to the swift but the steady...
goes methodically through the gate after them...


INT. THE OLD CITY, JERUSALEM - END OF DAY

The last of the light burnishes the narrow cobbled streets
and the stone walls. Mackensie and Joanna running through the
crowded souks, and bazaars, the Arab and Israeli markets,
some in ancient tunnels, others on the narrow stone streets.
Mackensie holding her good arm, moving her through the chaos
of the ancient city. Running through the incongruous ancient
markets, our assassin and his unlikely soulmate trying to
dash for freedom. The Soldiers, along with the Israeli Man
gaining on them...racing after them through the endless
marketplace. And some distance behind them, Mr. Lime,
steadily making his way...

Mackensie and Joanna reach another gate, running back out of
the city...The Soldiers and the Israeli Man now shortly
behind them...He blindly runs Joanna up some stairs crowded
with Arabs going somewhere...The Israeli Police and the
Israeli Man just behind them...


EXT. DOME OF THE ROCK - LAST OF THE DAY

They come out onto an open stone plaza as large as three
football fields spread out before the eternal golden dome of
the Arab MOSQUE, the Dome of the Rock. And as far as the eye
can see are the prone figures of fervent Muslims, maybe five
thousand people in neat rows, all on their hands and knees in
supplication, bowing and raising their heads on prayer mats,
in prayer. The Soldiers and the Israeli Man nearly upon them;
Mackensie takes Joanna, moving her into the mass of the
endless penitents...The Soldiers must stop, not allowed to go
into this holy place...And when we look again we’ve lost
sight of them, Mackensie and Joanna having disappeared
somewhere amongst the ardent followers...Mr. Lime arrives. He
stops looking out at the sea of thousands in prayer;
                                                        99.


and among them, I would say infidels, but more appropriately
strangers, welcome in this place of God. And as the sun, if
on cue, goes down for the day, the last gasp of its light...

WHEN WE SEE FROM HIGH ABOVE, FROM A CEILING’S VANTAGE POINT,
MACKENSIE AND JOANNA GOING THROUGH A CROWDED SECURITY LINE AT
AN AIRPORT.


INT. BEN GURION AIRPORT, TEL AVIV - NIGHT

Mackensie and Joanna making their way in the SECURITY
LINE...When we see the familiar appearance of the indomitable
Mr. Lime coming into the line not far behind them...Mackensie
instinctively turns and sees him...Mr. Lime, without any
concern for others in line, making his way toward them...
Mackensie and Joanna moving quickly through the metal
detectors...Mackensie is stopped, made to go back...Mr. Lime
coming for them...going into his pocket, taking out his
pen...Mackensie goes back through the metal detector...
stopped again...this time taken aside to be patted and
frisked...All the while Mr. Lime, his pen in hand, is almost
to them...when Joanna, needing to stop him, suddenly starts
to scream...

                    JOANNA
              (pointing at Mr. Lime)
          He’s got a gun...!!

And it becomes complete chaos, many ducking for cover, others
running...Soldiers plowing into the fray...to encircle Mr.
Lime...while Mackensie and Joanna in the chaos, run through
security and up an escalator...

                     MR. LIME
              (holding it up, showing
               them)
          It’s just a pen...

He clicks it to show it is harmless...And if they need more
proof, he writes on his notepad, tearing it off...showing
them, it’s only a pen, having written, smartly, “Shalom.”
(Peace.)


INT. TERMINAL, BEN GURION AIRPORT - NIGHT

Mackensie and Joanna running through the terminal to the
gate...the plane has all but boarded...they show their
boarding passes and run down the ramp for the plane...Mr.
Lime, nearing the gate, steadily coming after them...They go
onto the plane...Mr. Lime reaches the gate just as the door
to the plane is being closed after them...He goes down the
ramp...
                                                       100.


                    A GATE AGENT
          I’m afraid the door’s closed...

He shows her a boarding pass...

                    A GATE AGENT (CONT’D)
          Once it’s closed, it’s closed.

He’s still...


INT. THE AIRPLANE - NIGHT

Mackensie and Joanna settled into their seats. Mackensie
looks out the window. The Plane starting to taxi away. He can
see standing at the terminal window looking out at the plane
is Mr. Lime.


INT. TERMINAL, BEN GURION - NIGHT

Mr. Lime looking out the window at the airplane at Mackensie
in the plane’s window.


INT. THE AIRPLANE - NIGHT

Mackensie, as the plane moves away, looking at Mr. Lime in
the terminal window. And Mr. Lime, never one to be daunted,
does just what Mr. Lime would do, waves a small, almost dear,
“goodbye,” as in “not for long.” When we hear the familiar,
“Bing.”

                    JOANNA
          One week. Seven days.

WHEN WE SEE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PEACEFUL STREAMS RUNNING
THROUGH GREEN HILLSIDES. AND WE SEE A CAR COMING ALONG A
COUNTRY ROAD.

“County Donegal.” “Ireland.”


INT. THE CAR - DAY

Mackensie driving. Joanna sitting up front with him.

                    JOANNA
          Why won’t you tell me where we are
          going and why? I never wanted to come
          to Ireland ever again. I hired you to
          kill me so I wouldn’t have to even
          think about it. This is cruel.
                                                       101.


                    MACKENSIE
          You will thank me.

She’s quiet. They turn off onto a smaller country road, that
goes into the hills. Sheep become plentiful. Small sheep
farms, and traditional Irish cottages.

                    JOANNA
              (remembering)
          He spoke Gaelic.

She says something in Gaelic.

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          “I love you, not for never, but
          forever.”

She starts to cry.

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          Why didn’t you do what you were paid
          to do? You have made it all come back.
          I can’t bear it. I can’t live with it.

He doesn’t say anything. They come to a dirt road that goes
down onto a sheep farm. He parks the car on a hillside above
the farm. He gets out. She hesitates and gets out.


EXT. IRISH COUNTRYSIDE, SHEEP FARM - DAY

Sheep fill the top of the hill...dogs barking and a shepherd
tending them. There’s the sound of VOICES down at the small
farmhouse. And they can see a WOMAN, buttoning a coat, coming
out...and after a moment a MAN in his late thirties wearing a
peacoat and a flat Irish cap comes out behind her. He looks
like what he is, a playwright.

                    JOANNA
              (stops)
          It’s him. Danny boy. Why did you do
          this to me?

He’s quiet. They watch the Irish Playwright walking up the
road with his wife. They stop at where their road turns off
from the country road, standing talking. Some moments and
there’s the sound of a Bus. And coming around the bend,
stopping at the farmhouse road, is a small school bus. Two
children, two Girls, jump out. The Bus driving off. Danny and
his wife and his children, very happy to see each other...
they go back down the road to their farmhouse, a particularly
close knit family, the girls chattering away...then running
the rest of the way to the house...
                                                       102.


Danny and his wife wearing their good feelings about the way
things are like clothing, going back to the house...he stops
for a moment to kiss her and they follow the girls inside...
And they are gone just like that, the only sounds the sheep
and the dogs as the shepherd walks the flock further up the
hill. Joanna’s still. She looks at him. And she says, truly
grateful...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          Thank you...I wouldn’t want him not to
          have that happiness... (and as hard as
          it is to say...) He did the right
          thing.

She looks at him. An Irish breeze ruffles at their clothing.

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
              (and she says from the
               bottom of her heart)
          I love you.

                    MACKENSIE
              (smiles)
          Don’t say that.

                    JOANNA
              (her smile)
          I did.

She looks at him.

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          You keep your promises. Mean it or
          not. You make me glad to be alive.

And unsaid is, “what else could anybody want?” And as they
stand on the green hillside in “County Donegal.”


INT. IRISH HOTEL, GALWAY - NIGHT

We see them at the desk checking into a small hotel in the
coastal town of Galway. Turning from the desk, starting for
the stairs, he stops at a small gift shop.

                    MACKENSIE
          I need some toothpaste...

He goes inside...He gets a toothpaste going to the counter
when he sees a rack of paperbacks and a particular book
catches his attention. A copy of “Girl, Alone.” Joanna’s
first book, which has on the cover a casket in a grave.
                                                          103.


INT. THEIR HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

We PAN across the book on a nightstand to Joanna and
Mackensie making love in the small top floor room where the
ceiling angles to meet the floor; and one can see out the
window the River Corrib meeting the Atlantic Ocean.

When they’ve finished, laying in the dark, Joanna holding
him...

                    JOANNA
          Where do we go from here?

And his silence in the dark tells us he doesn’t know...


INT. THEIR SMALL ROOM, NIGHT - LATER

Joanna is asleep...Mackensie unable to sleep is reading her
book...There’s the startling RING of the phone...Joanna
awakened...Mackensie grabs it...

                    A WOMAN’S VOICE (OVER)
          A Mr. Lime is calling from London.

                    MACKENSIE
          Tell him I’m not answering.

He hangs up.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
              (the obvious)
          He found us.

She’s quiet, trying to go back to sleep. He goes back to her
book, the casket in the grave on the cover. He puts it down,
thinking...Something substantial crosses his mind. He takes
up the phone.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          I’d like to make a plane reservation.

WHEN SUDDENLY WE SEE A PLANE LANDING.


INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - EVENING

We see them getting off of a plane. Where we see a sign on
the wall, “WELCOME TO BUFFALO.”

                    JOANNA
          You still haven’t said yet why we’re
          coming here?
                                                        104.


And he still doesn’t. And as they get on the escalator on
their way down the street...


EXT. A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, BUFFALO, NEW YORK - NIGHT

We see a Taxi coming through a neat leafy neighborhood with
small but comfortable houses. It comes to a stop in front of
a house. They get out...They go to the door...RINGING the
BELL. A moment and the door opens. And the widow CAROL
WATSON, answers the door, startled to see him and her there.
We can see inside the solid looking man ANDY, the Homicide
Detective, is sitting at the kitchen table, the two of them
having dinner.


INT. CAROL WATSON’S HOME - NIGHT

We see a portrait photograph of Carol and her late husband
Gregory over a mantle. Carol and Andy with Mackensie and
Joanna sitting in a plain simply decorated living room.
Mackensie is telling them:

                    MACKENSIE
          She needs to be kept safe for six
          days.

Carol and Andy are both quiet, having heard their story, not
knowing what to think.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          I’m done with this. I’d like to turn
          myself in. I thought of you.

Andy is quiet.

                    ANDY
          I can’t arrest you without someone
          making a charge, without
          evidence...It’s more like a book, a
          murder mystery, a thriller, than
          having any actuality.

                    MACKENSIE
          It must seem that way, but it is
          deadly real. I am sure Mr. Lime is on
          his way to Buffalo right now. Nobody
          has ever escaped their contract.

Carol looks at the portrait of her and her husband.
                                                       105.


                    CAROL WATSON
          I wouldn’t press charges...you gave
          him what he wanted...a peaceful
          ending. I wouldn’t think anybody
          would...a person’s last wish is
          sacred...

And giving them her answer...getting up...

                    CAROL WATSON (CONT’D)
          I’ll make up your room...


INT. GUEST ROOM, THE HOUSE IN BUFFALO - NIGHT

Joanna, having come from the bathroom, in a nightgown Carol
had loaned her, comes back into the room. Mackensie is still
dressed...and putting on his coat...he tells her...

                    MACKENSIE
          I’m going...

                    JOANNA
          What do you mean, you’re going?

                    MACKENSIE
          I’ve done all I can for you. You will
          be safe here for the time that’s left.
          You aren’t safe with me.

She moves to stop him...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          When the time, the remaining days have
          come and gone, go somewhere nobody can
          find you. (and still the hint of
          menace...) Not even men.

He takes her shoulders.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          Start over. Be whoever you want to be.
          What do writers call it, create a
          pseudonym for yourself, another you
          who has a rich and full life of
          romance and adventure. I’m sure you
          will meet someone who will be good to
          you. You deserve somebody who is.

And with that he turns to go...

                    JOANNA
          Mackensie...
                                                          106.


And she holds him...

                    MACKENSIE
              (like Bogart)
          You never know, kid, maybe we’ll run
          into each other again. That’s what
          happens with lost souls.

And turning he goes out the door...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
              (motioning, protectively)
          And lock it...

And he’s gone...She looks out the window...a Taxi is
waiting...she sees Mackensie cross from the house, get into
the Taxi...and he’s gone. Her watch goes off, “BING.”

                    JOANNA
              (says to herself)
          Five more days.


INT. A BUFFALO CHAIN HOTEL - NIGHT

Mackensie, unable to sleep, sitting alone in the sad lounge
in a chain hotel’s bar having a drink...thinking about what
comes next...He takes the paperback copy of her book out of
his coat pocket...He finds his place, near the end,
reading...He reads something that has him go back a page and
read it again...He stops to think about something...as he
sits alone at the bar his reflection in the bar mirror, a man
without a home.


INT. BUFFALO AIRPORT - MORNING

Where we see Mr. Lime getting off of a plane, coming to
America. As he starts into the terminal...

                       MACKENSIE
          Archie.

He turns. Mackensie who has been sitting waiting for him,
gets up.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          It was the only flight from London.
          Can we talk?

                    MR. LIME
              (no surprise)
          I’m starving.
                                                       107.


INT. A BUFFALO DINER - MORNING

A working class diner. Mr. Lime and Mackensie are sitting in
a booth. Mr. Lime relishing a plate of three eggs, five
pieces of bacon, hash browns, corn bread and soaked in gravy.

                     MR. LIME
              (enjoying)
          Americans know the value of a good
          breakfast.

He looks at him.

                    MACKENSIE
              (after a beat)
          She’s where “London” can’t hurt her.

                    MR. LIME
          You know that isn’t possible.
              (and wise)
          You didn’t come to see me to talk me
          out of this. You’ve decided to finish
          the job yourself as it was meant to be
          done. I’m sorry it’s come to that, but
          that’s the right decision.

                    MACKENSIE
          I’m in love with her.

                    MR. LIME
          Of course you are. You will be in love
          with someone else again.

                    MACKENSIE
          I suppose so. What is this job’s hold
          on me?

                    MR. LIME
          People come and go...but the only
          thing we have is our self respect. I’m
          sorry it has come to this. You’ve
          given her the best time of her life.

                    MACKENSIE
              (nods, certain)
          I’ll do it.

He gets up.

                    MR. LIME
          Let me know when and where.

Mackensie turns to go...
                                                       108.


                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          It will be the way it’s supposed to
          be. She won’t know what hit her. She
          said it herself in her book, “Girl Up
          A Tree.” (he smiles his smile) “There
          are many ways to skin a cat.”
              (...and noticing)
          I see you’re reading her first.

And Mackensie remembers he has her paperback book, “Girl
Alone,” with the casket on the cover in his pocket. He takes
it out, and without any fanfare tosses it in a trash can...

                    MACKENSIE
              (meaning the book, the
               extended assignment)
          I’m done with it...

And heads out the door.


INT. CAROL’S HOUSE, BUFFALO - MORNING

The phone’s RINGING. Carol comes to get it.

                    CAROL WATSON
          Yes, of course... (calling) Joanna...

Joanna comes to get the phone.

                    CAROL WATSON (CONT’D)
          It’s Mackensie...

Joanna takes up the phone...Carol goes into the other room...

                    MACKENSIE (OVER)
          Can you meet me right away? I really
          need to say goodbye.

He tells her where...

                    JOANNA
          I’m coming...

                    MACKENSIE (OVER)
          Is Andy around?

                    JOANNA
              (turns)
          Andy?

And as Andy, putting on his gun, getting ready for work,
comes out of the bedroom...
                                                          109.


WE SUDDENLY SEE THE BREATHTAKING SIGHT OF THE NIAGARA FALLS
THUNDERING AS THEY DROP BELOW.


EXT. NIAGARA FALLS, EXCURSION BOAT - DAY

We see Mackensie and Joanna putting on their bright red rain
ponchos as they wait to board the Maid of the Mist Niagara
Falls EXCURSION BOAT. Arms protectively across her chest she
seems tremendously nervous.

                    MACKENSIE
          Are you okay?

                    JOANNA
          I don’t like all the noise and the
          power of the falls...It scares me to
          death...

                    MACKENSIE
          I’ll take care of you...I thought it
          was a glorious way to end things for
          us.

                    JOANNA
              (a wan smile)
          You have a way of putting things.

He puts his arm around her.

                    MACKENSIE
          You’re very brave.

                    JOANNA
          That’s a familiar woman’s refrain.
          When don’t I have to be brave?

The people, all in their red ponchos, start getting onto the
boat. As they follow them aboard...


EXT. MAID OF THE MIST EXCURSION BOAT, NIAGARA FALLS, BUFFALO -
DAY

Joanna and Mackensie on the crowded boat of newlyweds
celebrating seeing the mighty Falls. Mackensie, his arm
around her, the two of them getting wet from the falls’
spray...

                    MACKENSIE
              (above the roar)
          We got married here. Took this very
          boat.
                                                          110.


He goes into his pocket. He gives her a child’s girl’s ring.

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          The next best thing.

He puts the ring on her finger. Touched, she puts her head on
his shoulder. The boat approaches even closer to the falls...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          Let’s get a better look.

They push their way to the back of the boat as it swings
around coming precariously close to the falls. Everyone
presses forward to the railing to get as close as they can...
Mackensie and Joanna at the front of the people at the
railing...As the boat swings as close as possible under the
roaring falls he grabs her, holding her, romantically kissing
her, goodbye...There’s a crush of people where we lose sight
of Mackensie and Joanna in all the red ponchos for a brief
moment...until out of all the red we hear a SHOUT...

                    MACKENSIE (OVER) (CONT’D)
          Woman overboard...!!!

People press close to him...Mackensie searching the water for
sight of her...A Deckhand comes running...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          She was looking over the railing and
          she just went in!

Everybody scrambles to look if they can see her...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
              (to the Deckhand)
          For gods sake, do something!

But it is obvious there is nothing that can be done...she is
gone! Mackensie left to look at the falls and the deep dark
water without blinking an eye.


EXT. MAID OF THE MIST EXCURSION BOAT, DOCK - LATER IN THE DAY

The boat emptied...Mackensie talking to some Policemen.

                    A POLICEMAN
          There’s a rescue boat searching...

                    MACKENSIE
          Has anyone ever survived...?

                    A MAN’S VOICE (OVER)
          Not in that particular area...
                                                          111.


And we see it’s ANDY arriving.

                     ANDY
           My God, what happened?

                      MACKENSIE
           We were just looking at the falls and
           she went over. She must have
           tripped...

                     ANDY
               (a beat)
           I’m sorry but I have to ask. Do you
           think she wanted to take her life?

                     MACKENSIE
           God no, nothing like that. She had
           everything to live for.


EXT. MAID OF THE MIST EXCURSION BOAT, DOCK - NIGHTFALL

Mackensie coming off the boat. Starting for a line of Taxi
Cabs...

                     A MAN’S VOICE (OVER)
           Mackensie...

He turns...The ever present Mr. Lime is standing there.

                     MR. LIME
           Easier than you thought?

                      MACKENSIE
               (nods)
           Easier than I thought. It would be
           just what she wanted, unexpected and
           quick and painless.

He nods.

                        MR. LIME
           Well done.

He starts to walk away.

                     MR. LIME (CONT’D)
           You will let me know if they find her
           body, won’t you?

And he walks off. Mackensie stands for a moment in the
falling light looking at the falls...looking at the boat...
and crosses to get into a Taxi...and he’s driven away.
                                                          112.


We stay for some more time...the Captain and his Crew closing
up the boat, leaving for the night...The lonely boat sitting
at the empty dock...When we see a FIGURE coming out of a boat
closet in a familiar red rain slicker...and there’s the sound
of the distinctive “BING.”


EXT. NIAGARA FALLS - MORNING

A boggy bay at the bottom in sight of the falls...a figure in
their red poncho lying half out of the water in the weeds...

And now we see Andy is already there, the very first to
arrive...Another Policeman coming along with a FORENSIC
PHOTOGRAPHER...The Policeman going to examine the body.

                    ANDY
              (stopping him)
          You don’t need to. I took care of it.
          I started a report. Simple drowning.

The Policeman is glad not to have to be bothered. The
Photographer taking PHOTOGRAPHS of the body of the well known
drowned author Joanna Dunlap.

WHEN WE SEE THE RESULTS OF THE PHOTOGRAPH IN A BUFFALO
NEWSPAPER: “Author Drowns At Falls.” “Joanna Elizabeth
Dunlap, award winning mystery writer, accidentally fell from
the Maid of the Mist excursion boat to her death at Niagara
Falls...”


EXT. BROOKLYN, NEW YORK CEMETERY - END OF THE DAY

An old timeless and endless hillside cemetery with the city
in the distant background. Where we see Joanna’s casket,
reminiscent of her book cover, being lowered into a grave. A
small number of people, Manhattan book types, along with Andy
and Carol, watching the casket being lowered. And as
Mackensie is first to throw dirt on her grave...And while
others do...we see at the end of the line the last to dig a
shovel of dirt and throw it on her grave, verifying his job
is through, is Mr. Lime.

As the people get in their cars and leave, Mackensie is last
to go. He takes one final look, and crossing to his car
leaves...We linger on the gravesite...A BULLDOZER COMES TO
PUSH DIRT ON TOP OF THE CASKET...FILLING THE HOLE...When we
hear the distinctive “BING” of Joanna’s watch. Which has us
DISSOLVE TO:
                                                          113.


INT. JOANNA’S GRAVE - LATE IN THE DAY

The buried CASKET. And we further DISSOLVE TO:


INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - DAY

Where we see Joanna is lying in her casket, not advised for
the claustrophobic, with an oxygen mask over her nose and
mouth and an oxygen tank nearby. Her oxygen mask rising and
falling with each breath of life, despite being buried alive.


INT. A BROOKLYN RESTAURANT, FUNERAL RECEPTION - NIGHT

A memorial reception. Poster boards are displayed around the
room with photographs of Joanna’s various book covers with
their titles, along with a number of stunning photographs of
Joanna...


INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT

Joanna, literally buried alive, breathing with the oxygen
tank...But we can see the oxygen level is falling...


INT. THE BROOKLYN FUNERAL RECEPTION FOR JOANNA - NIGHT

When we see Mackensie bringing Mr. Lime a plate of food.

                    MR. LIME
          That’s awfully nice of you.

                     MACKENSIE
          I thought you might like the
          chicken...

Mr. Lime, never one to pass up a meal, eats his food...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          I have a plane to catch.

                    MR. LIME
          I thought I’d stay another day and
          have a meal at Le Bernadin.
              (satisfied)
          I’ve filled my end of the bargain.

Mackensie nods.

                    MACKENSIE
          We both have.
                                                          114.


                    MR. LIME
              (appreciating)
          The chicken is quite good. (and) We
          will probably never see each other
          again. You are a deserving adversary.

Mackensie nods his respect... “And you, Mr. Lime.” And as he
starts out of the Restaurant...coming by Andy and Carol...

                    MACKENSIE
          Thank you for everything...

He shakes Andy’s hand and embraces Carol...and as he hurries
out...


INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT

Joanna’s rhythmic breathing. But the oxygen supply starting
to become exhausted.


INT. TAXI, BROOKLYN - NIGHT

Mackensie in the back of the cab looking at his watch.

                    MACKENSIE
              (to the Driver, concerned)
          Can you go any quicker?


INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT

The sound of the oxygen delivery has begun to labor. As
Joanna breathes in and out, in and out...


INT. TAXI, BROOKLYN - NIGHT

The cab turning a corner. When SUDDENLY a car running a light
careens into them, sending the Cab skidding across the
intersection...Mackensie, despite his seat belt, bounced
around. He finds his balance...shaken, he struggles to open
the door...he climbs out...


EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

He moves along the street as fast as he is able to go...Just
ahead is the CEMETERY...
                                                          115.


INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT

The oxygen has dissipated to a hissing sound...Joanna
starting to gasp for air...


EXT. BROOKLYN CEMETERY - NIGHT

Mackensie, in some pain, making his way across the cemetery.


INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT

The hissing sound of the oxygen suddenly stops. Joanna
breathing the last of it...


EXT. BROOKLYN CEMETERY, JOANNA’S GRAVESITE - NIGHT

Mackensie has managed to make it to her gravesite. He takes
up a shovel, starting to dig the fresh dirt...


INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT

The oxygen tank has gone dead still. Joanna pulls off the
oxygen mask gasping for whatever air is trapped in the
casket.


EXT. BROOKLYN CEMETERY, JOANNA'S GRAVESITE - NIGHT

Mackensie digging as fast as he can.


INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT

She struggles to breathe whatever last bit of air there is...


EXT. BROOKLYN CEMETERY, JOANNA'S GRAVESITE - NIGHT

His shovel hits the casket...he pushes the dirt away...


INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT

She’s stopped breathing...
                                                       116.


EXT. BROOKLYN CEMETERY, JOANNA'S GRAVESITE - NIGHT

He struggles to open the casket...Joanna lying still...and
she suddenly takes in a huge breath of air and comes
completely awake, deeply breathing in the saving air...
Mackensie grabs her up...pulling her out...kneeling with her,
letting her breathe in the precious air...

                    JOANNA
              (finding her breath)
          What took you so fucking long?

                    MACKENSIE
              (him, wry)
          Talk about your woman in distress!

And she starts to laugh, cathartic, at the absurdity of it
all...Mackensie sharing the cathartic laughter with her...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
              (for everything)
          Shit!

And they keep laughing, glad to be together, glad to be
alive...When they hear a distinctive CLICKING SOUND...And
they see Mr. Lime, clicking his deadly pen as he does, has
come to the gravesite.

                    MR. LIME
              (had realized)
          I read the same book you did...

He takes out an old paperback copy of her book, “Girl Alone.”

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
              (reading the end)
          “He pulled her out of her casket,
          holding her as she struggled to catch
          her breath. And she said, ‘What took
          you so long?’ Which he planned to make
          up to her in every way he could. He
          said, ‘You have to make me a promise.’
          She looked at his rough face. He said
          to her, ‘You can never go away again.’
          She didn’t say anything...she couldn’t
          make that promise. No woman could.”

He shuts the book. They’re dead quiet. When her watch sounds,
“Bing.”

                    JOANNA
              (to Mr. Lime)
          That’s all of it. You’ve run out of
          time.
                                                       117.


                    MR. LIME
          I’m afraid that’s on London time.
          We’re on New York time now.

He turns the pen into the lethal weapon that it is.

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
              (meaning the open grave)
          You saved me the trouble of having to
          find someone to bury you two...

He points the pistol fingering the small trigger about to
kill them...

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          Safe travels...

When for some reason he loses his footing slightly
stumbling...He tries to find his balance...

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
              (confused by it)
          I’ve lost my balance...

He goes down on his knees...He doesn’t understand what’s
happening to him...

                    MR. LIME (CONT’D)
          What’s happening to me?

He tries to get back up but his legs won’t support him and he
sits heavily back down. He’s not doing well, not doing well
at all.

                    MACKENSIE
              (simply)
          You shouldn’t have eaten the chicken.

And he tosses him the empty deadly nasal spray bottle...

                    MACKENSIE (CONT’D)
          Archie. Didn’t your mother ever tell
          you to watch what you eat?

Mr. Lime seems to want to say something but losing his battle
with consciousness pitches over onto his stomach like a
beached whale. It’s dead still. They don’t move taking a
moment to appreciate the exquisite ending together. And as
they silently celebrate, sharing a well earned smile of
triumph...
                                                         118.


EXT. THE BROOKLYN CEMETERY, JOANNA’S GRAVE - NIGHT

Mackensie and Joanna finishing putting Mr. Lime into the
casket. Closing the lid on him.


EXT. THE BROOKLYN CEMETERY, JOANNA’S GRAVE - NIGHT

And we see them from a distance walking away from the grave,
walking down the hill past the endless grave markers leaving
it all behind.


EXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAYBREAK

The glorious Bridge. And we see Joanna and Mackensie walking
over the bridge back to the City inexorably together. We
linger for a moment on their disappearing into the distance
with the wonderful feeling anything is possible.

And it seems we should end there...but wait...

WHEN WE FIND OURSELVES ON AN AIRPLANE AGAIN.


INT. A FLIGHT TO LONDON - NIGHT

Joanna settling into her seat. And the first thing we hear is
the MAN’S VOICE, self effacing like Cary Grant, that began
our journey:

                    THE MAN’S VOICE (OVER)
          I think this is my seat.

And we see Mackensie with his bags and in his overcoat
smiling at her, taking his seat, right back where we
metaphorically started. But this time she says...

                    JOANNA
              (smiling)
          I saved it just for you...

And so happy to be together...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
              (joyfully)
          We made it.

                    MACKENSIE
              (equally, his smile)
          We did!
                                                       119.


INT. THE PLANE, NIGHT - LATER

Joanna and Mackensie sitting together in the dark plane...

                    MACKENSIE
              (whispering in the dark)
          This time we can go anyplace we ever
          dreamed of. We can take all the time
          or as little as we want because we
          have each other.

                    JOANNA
          And you can be yourself. No more
          “London.”

                    MACKENSIE
              (nods yes)
          No more “London.”

She puts her head on his shoulder.

                    JOANNA
          It sounds too good to be true.

She starts to close her eyes...

                    JOANNA (CONT’D)
          You gave me the best time of my life.

                    MACKENSIE
          Sweet dreams...

She looks at Mackensie once more as if being certain to
remember him...She gives him a small last contented smile,
and breathing regularly she is safely, peacefully, and
blissfully asleep...

WHEN DAYLIGHT SUDDENLY POURS IN.


INT. THE AIRPLANE - MORNING

The plane landed, arriving at the GATE. The familiar chime
that it’s safe to get up. Great activity, people gathering
their stuff, getting ready to go. Mackensie gets up getting
his things, shrugging on his overcoat. Surprisingly, he
starts to make his way off the plane for some reason without
her...Before he departs he stops and looks back at Joanna.
And here you have it.

We see she is still lying in her seat with her head just out
of the blanket, eyes closed, motionless. Joanna seemingly at
peace, having “lived” the life she so badly wanted, filled
with romance and adventure.
                                                       120.


But now may I say, “dead to the world.” Mackensie takes a
last look at her, and his work done, gets off. The plane
empties. Joanna still hasn’t moved. A Flight Attendant trying
to rouse her, to no avail. She goes for help.


INT. LONDON HEATHROW - MORNING

Mackensie, his job complete, moving through the busy
terminal...


INT. THE AIRPLANE - MORNING

Joanna completely alone, lying in her seat on the empty
plane. And just to put a button on things, as ironic as can
be, we hear one of the most romantic movie songs ever sung,
“Moon River,” playing over...”Moon River, wider than a mile,
I’m crossing you in style some day. Oh, dream maker, you
heart breaker, wherever you’re going I’m going your way...”


INT. LONDON HEATHROW - MORNING

The unforgettable Mackensie, accompanied by the song, moving
through the terminal. “Two drifters, off to see the world...”


INT. THE AIRPLANE - MORNING

Joanna, still in her seat. “There’s such a lot of world to
see.” Or may I say she is where “being dead” is only another
day at the office for “London.” “We’re after the same
rainbow’s end...”


INT. LONDON HEATHROW - MORNING

Mackensie moving off, but before he goes he turns to look
back at us. He smiles, shrugs as if to say... “All good
things must come to an end.”

And as he goes on about his way moving through the
terminal...and I have the distinct feeling we haven’t seen
the last of him...But for now... “Waiting round the bend...”


INT. THE AIRPLANE - MORNING

Joanna lying in her seat. “My huckleberry friend...” Her arm
almost gracefully falls. Where we can see her watch on her
wrist as it goes off for a final time, “Bing.” “Moon River,
and me...”
