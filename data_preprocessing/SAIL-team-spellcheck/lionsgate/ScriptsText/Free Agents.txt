     We hear HEAVY BREATHING...

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:


1    EXT. LOS ANGELES - NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - 4:00AM
     It’s too early for birds to start chirping, but not too early
     for this determined runner, WILL GRIER (26)-- He breathes
     hard with sweat pouring down his face.
     As he rounds the corner, a steep hill appears-- Sparking a
     fire in Will’s hungry eyes, he puts it in 5th gear, and
     SPRINTS all the way to the top...

     On top of the hill, he stops for a deep breath. He uses his
     shirt as a makeshift towel-- Revealing, a SCAR across his
         LI

     abdomen. We 360 around Will, and now notice how impressive
     his athletic physique is...

                                                         CUT TO:


2    INT/EXT. CAR - DRIVING - WASHINGTON, D.C. - SAME
                                   AT

     Vidal drives through traffic, stressed and late. Her mind
     races faster than the wiper blades zipping back and forth
     across her rain drenched window-- She makes a sharp turn,
     and loose papers slide off the passenger seat.
                                          E

     The speeding car resembles a messy locker, with empty coffee
     cups and papers littered about. As her eyes look in the rear-
     view, they catch an empty toddler car seat in the back...


3    INT. GRIER HOME - LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

     Will enters his modest home, and walks through the silent
     living room. Unpacked boxes and limited decoration show he
     hasn’t lived there long.

4V   He grabs a remote and flips on the TV. An “ESPN-like”
     channel pops on: A REPORTER stands in front of the LA
     FOOTBALL FACILITY-- A chyron reads, “LAST DAY FOR FOOTBALL
     TEAMS TO MAKE CUTS AND FINALIZE THEIR 53-MAN ROSTERS.”
                                                             2.


    Will gives it a long stare and shuts it off.


5   INT. GRIER HOME - JAMES’ BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

    Will peaks his head into a bedroom cluttered with dinosaurs
    and monster trucks. He smiles when his eyes find his son,
    JAMES (6, socially withdrawn boy with special needs), fast
    asleep. He closes the door, and walks down to his bedroom.


6   INT. GRIER HOME - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

    Will walks in to find his wife, LISA (26) sitting up in bed
    with her eyes closed. He takes a seat on his side of the
    bed. She has no words.

                          WILL
        LI

              You okay?

                        LISA
          O

              Just praying for us.

                        WILL
                   N

              It’s the last time, Lis.    If I
              don’t make this cut--
                          SG

                        LISA
              Will, you’ve said that for 3 years
              now. How many more times are you
              gonna say it?
                                  AT

                        WILL
              This time it’s different, I know it
              is... Been making real strides
              with the Special Teams unit.
                                          E

    Lisa falls silent and gives Will a look of deep angst.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
              What?

                        LISA
              I was gonna wait until after
              practice today...

    Lisa grabs a letter from inside the night stand and hands it
    to Will. His eyes quickly race through it, fear sets in.

                        WILL
              How long have you had this?

                        LISA
              A few weeks... Maybe more.
                                                             3.


                        WILL
              Lisa, you gotta tell me when things
              are goin’ bad like this.

                         LISA
              I thought I could figure it out
              while you focused on making the
              team.
                  (beat)
              My mom can’t give us any more
              money, Will.

    Lisa exits the room.

                        LISA (CONT'D)
              I gotta get James ready.

                           WILL
        LI

              Lisa!

7   INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

    Lisa readies for breakfast, Will follows close behind.
                   N

                        WILL
              You can tell me anything, you know
                       SG

              that, right?

                        LISA
              Will, I’m scared. We’re maxed out
              and got a growin’ stack-a-bills
                                  AT

              that just aren’t going away...

                        WILL
              I’m gonna take care of all that--
                                         E

                         LISA
              What about insurance for James’
              medicine? Or a school that can
              handle his needs??
                  (cold beat)
              Dreams don’t pay bills. And unless
              we get some good news, like today,
              they’re gonna throw us outta here!
                  (beat)
              I was thinkin’ James could stay in
              Arizona with my mother while I see
              if I can get my old job back...

                        WILL
              Lisa, listen to me.   No one’s-

    James walks in shaking off sleep, and Will’s tone softens.
                                                             4.


                        WILL (CONT'D)
              Hey, Buddy. Want some breakfast?
                        LISA
                  (wiping tears)
              James, sweetie, go sit down at the
              table, okay?

    James sits at the table while Lisa pulls it together, grabs a
    bowl and some cereal. Will joins her by the cupboard.
                        LISA (CONT'D)
              You gotta leave or you’re going to
              be late.
                        WILL
              I love you.

                        LISA
        LI

              I love you.
    They kiss. Will then kisses the FOOTBALL LOCKET around her
          O

    neck-- She watches him exit, and kisses the football locket
    too. Will smiles, turns toward the front door, and crumples
    up the notice she gave him.
                   N

8   INT. RUSH DANIEL’S MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - SAME
                       SG

    In a bedroom fit for a king, CLOSE ON: EMERALD EYES, a MAN
    running is reflected back. We hear speeding steps on a
    WHIRRING treadmill--
                                 AT

    NOW CLOSE ON: SHOES pounding on treadmill. We slowly PAN UP
    to reveal: Horrific scars on gigantic ankles and knees. We
    PULL BACK to admire this man’s sheer physicality-- Rippling
    back muscles, bruised and scarred from battle and time.
                                         E

    He’s a modern day gladiator, but we’ll come to know him as
    RUSH DANIELS (38). Behind him, a shapely beautiful Latino
    woman, CARLA (25) lays in a opulent silk robe and watches
    from the bed. In front of Rush, his AGENT stands nervously..

                        RUSH’S AGENT
              Rush, they’ve offered to keep you
              around on a 1-year deal-- Granted
              they move you to Special Teams, you
              agree to be a good presence in the
              locker room...
                  (uncomfortable beat)
              And play for the league minimum.

    Rush angrily punches the off button, abruptly shutting down
    the high speeding rubber conveyor belt--
                                                             5.


    He hops off the treadmill, grabs a towel and walks over to a
    balcony-- Which overlooks an Olympic sized swimming pool.

                        RUSH
              So now I’m a charity case...
              Ungrateful motherfuckers.

    The Agent awkwardly steps away as Rush broods. Rush softens
    when Carla slinks over and wraps her arms around him.


9   INT. OLD FORD BRONCO - A LITTLE LATER

    Will navigates the freeway traffic listening to sports radio.

    As he drives, Will notices smoke starting to spew from under
    the car hood-- He takes a look at the dash and shakes his
    head. The engine temperature light is bright red.
        LI

    Will ignores the light and turns up the radio...

                        PETER CRANE (V.O.)
              I knew you guys would come around.

                        ESPN RADIO HOST (V.O.)
              Now you lose Marquees Jackson to

              retirement and your #1 wide-out,
              J.T. Winslow, is out for the year
              with a torn ACL... What are you
              going to do for receivers? We’re
              hearing a rumor that All Pro
                                            E

              receiver Derrick Snow might be
              coming to LA.

                        WILL
                  (under his breath)
              Why we lookin’ at receivers?   Throw
              to ME!

                        PETER CRANE (V.O.)
              We’re always looking to pick up a
              few weapons.

    Will pulls past the SECURITY GATE of the LOS ANGELES FOOTBALL
    practice facility. The lot is filled with EXPENSIVE CARS.
                                                                 6.


10   EXT. LA PRACTICE FACILITY - MINUTES LATER

     Will walks away from his car as the engine rattles and oozes
     smoke-- He heads to the building with a DUFFLE BAG over his
     shoulder, walking past SLIM SANDERS (32, likable and lanky
     veteran tight end), dealing with a standoffish woman, CHARISSE
     in an SUV.

     Slim and his young SON laugh and wave at each other until--
     Charisse cuts this father-son moment off by cruelly rolling
     up the boy’s tinted window. Slim now turns to her...

                         CHARISSE
               You need to read the papers, Slim.
               You know exactly what the court
               said. Best believe you’ll being
               hearin’ from my attorney!
         LI

     Slim watches longingly as she speeds off, defeated.

     Will approaches the building, there’s MEDIA everywhere.
           O

     Reporters swarm the handsome quarterback/leading man, PETER
     CRANE (30s) and follow his every step.
                    N

     Rush peacocks in colorfully expensive workout gear, diamond
     earrings and Oakley sunglasses. Rush can’t avoid the media buzz
     either...
                        SG

                         VARIOUS REPORTERS
               Rush Daniels!! Are you retiring
               after the season?? Is there any
               movement on the case???
                                    AT

     Will walks through the noise, going completely unnoticed.


11   INT. LA FACILITY - LOCKER ROOM - LATER
                                           E

     In a busy locker room, Will straps on his pads. Nearby he
     notices Slim slumped over and depressed by his locker.

                         WILL
               Hey Man, you good?

     Slim has no idea who he is, but appreciates the genuine
     concern.

                         SLIM
               Yeah, I’m cool.   Thanks.

     COACH BRACKNEY (50, aging badly) enters with KENNY DAVIS (25)
     his assistant coach, both holding clipboards.

               Listen up! We’ll announce our 53-

               wanna thank everyone in this room
               for your hard work throughout camp.
               For some of you, it’ll be the end
               of the road here... But hopefully
               not the end of your NFL journey!

12   EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY - MINUTES LATER
     The hitting is fast, hard and punishing.
     ANGLE ON - WILL running routes with precision.
     Will has good hands and good speed, but the CHEERS always
     seem to be for another player, DESHAWN WASHINGTON (26). Then
     a WHISTLE BLOWS indicating a break.
         LI

13   EXT. SIDELINES - A MINUTE LATER
           O

     Dozens of players have collected for a water break. Among
     them, we notice FOUR PLAYERS chatting by a Gatorade barrel--
                    N

     Rush holds court with Slim and MOUSE (27, Mohawk, a volatile,
                          SG

     wild-eyed cornerback) and JOHN (30s, a stocky full-back).
     Will walks up to get water, but he’s blocked by DeShawn.   Will
     tries to get by, he’s stopped again.
                         DESHAWN
                                  AT

               Man, you should be handing out my
               water, not drinking it.
                         WILL
               What d’you say to me?

     DeShawn turns and faces Will closely.

                         DESHAWN
               Time to take off them glass
               slippers... Only one of us finna
               makin’ this team, and it ain’t you.

                         WILL
               Y’worried about somethin’, DeShawn?

                          DESHAWN
               Worried?   Man, you sorry as fuck.

     DeShawn JABS at Will’s shoulder pad. Will pushes him back.
     Amid conversation with Slim and Mouse, Rush takes notice, and
     elbows Mouse.
                                                                8.


                         RUSH
               Young Boy got scrap.

     Will and DeShawn grab each other’s face masks.   Then...

                          ASST. COACH DAVIS
               G-d Damnit! Break it up!
                   (then)
               Punt Team, Special Teams, live
               drill... Let’s go!

14   The two units run out onto the field. The ball is snapped
     and the punter kicks it high into the air... DeShawn waits
     to receive the punt.

     Will knows this could be his last moment of pro football.
     His “nice guy” demeanor is replaced by something darker as he
     races down the field... DeShawn catches it and runs forward--
         LI

     DeShawn makes a move with the ball, but is held up by a
     defender-- Then, Will hits him with such merciless force that
           O

     DeShawn’s knee SNAPS while contorting from the blow. DeShawn
     goes down hard and SCREAMS-- Rush takes notice.
                    N

     WHISTLES BLOW as DeShawn writhes in pain, holding his knee. His
     season is over as trainers hustle over. As Will walks away, a
     storm of emotions fill up his eyes. What has he done?

15   EXT. F.B.I. - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

     At a conference table Deputy Head DON KIZINSKI (50’s) and a

     GROUP OF AGENTS watch Section Chief TED WALKER (60’s) speak
     by a projector. It displays photos from a Boston BANK HEIST.

     SUDDENLY-- Vidal bursts into the room with a stack of
     papers, breathless and disheveled. She takes a seat and

     flips through papers.

                         WALKER
               You’re all dismissed.

     The lights flick on and Agents stand up to leave.

               Good morning, Agent Vidal.
                   (checks watch)
               You’re only an hour late.

     Walker and Kizinski head toward the door-- Vidal springs out
     of her chair to block their path. “WAIT!”.

     Agents slow to leave listen in-- Including one unassuming
     and hard working agent, DEBORAH HENNESSY (20s).

          The football team owner in Miami?

          Exactly.

                    WALKER
          Today’s briefing was on the Premier
          One Bank heist in Boston.

Walker and Kizinski watch Vidal plug her computer into the
projector-- A U.S. MAP appears with FOUR red dots labeled:

Vidal clicks and images of the crimes appear on the screen.

          distant cities around the

          country... So distant, no one’s
          looked into them being connected.

          connects them.

Vidal hands Walker a report, his eyes scan the document.

                    VIDAL (CONT'D)
          I took the liberty of extensively
          researching possible links.

                     WALKER
          And?

                    VIDAL
          We received a partial hit on a
          ballistics report. Some of the
          ammunition found at the Victor
          Hyman mansion appears to have been
          used at the bank heist in Boston.

               Each of these robberies had the
               same number of assailants, 4.

     Footage from MIAMI CCTV and semi-truck DASH CAM footage play
     side by side. The action is strikingly similar.

               Multiple witnesses have described
               them as aggressive and athletic.

     Walker and Kizinski exit the room, both oblivious to Vidal’s
     disappointment. As the door closes behind them, her
     determination burns disappointment into fiery resolve.


16   INT. LA FACILITY - LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON

     Freshly showered FOOTBALL PLAYERS mill about, having fun.

     Will walks out of the shower with a towel on-- BANG! A
     locker slam spooks Will, he turns to see the stocky fullback
     angrily pack his stuff in a bag. Will takes a seat at his
     locker, watching Slim and Mouse console John... Another
     person cut, gulp. Rush walks up and hands John a gym bag.

Will turns back to his locker and minds his own business.   He
checks his phone to see multiple missed calls from Lisa.

                    RUSH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Will Grier.

Will looks up to see RUSH and almost falls out of his seat.

     Footsteps approach. Will puts his head down and gets bumped
     by the man exiting, S-BULL, (34) a Samoan, thick-necked,
     gargantuan lineman swats him aside like a fruit-fly.

20   INT. F.B.I. - WALKER’S OFFICE - DAY

     Walker sits behind his desk talking to Kizinski and Salaam--
     KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK. Vidal’s head pops through the door,
     Walker waves her in.

                         WALKER
               Perfect timing. Do you have that
               report for Agent Salaam?

     Vidal nods and holds up the folder, but holds it back...
                                                             16.


                         VIDAL
               Sir, I’d like to discuss the
               handling of this investigation.

                         SALAAM
               Should I leave?

     Walker shakes his head no. After a tense beat, Vidal
     straightens up with nerves of steel, and goes for it.

                         VIDAL
               Sir, with all due respect to Agent
               Salaam, this is my case. I refuse
               to get relegated to busy work...
               Not on this one.

           O

               they’re never afforded the
               opportunity to gain any?
                   (to Walker)
                    N

               Sir, I’ve worked my ass off and
               given the bureau everything I’ve
               had since day one. I just want a
                        SG

               chance to show you why I’m the one
               to lead.

     Walker laughs. He can’t help but be impressed by her moxie.
     He looks at Salaam then Vidal, and shrugs.
                                  AT

                         WALKER

               crews, nationwide, last four years.

     Vidal walks away, barely containing her enthusiasm. Before
     she exits Walker clears his throat, “Vidal”, she stops.

                         WALKER (CONT'D)
               You’re gonna need to pick a team.


21   INT. FBI OFFICE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     With a big smile, Vidal exits and nearly bumps into Hennessy.
     She clearly eavesdropped on the whole conversation.

                         HENNESSY
               Agent Vidal, I’m Deborah Hennessy.

               First off.
                   (whispers)
               That was bad ass.
                   (back to normal)
               I would be honored if I could be on
               your team... And I promise I’m not
               a dick. In fact, I was voted most
               optimistic in middle school.

     In a film session with the TEAM, Will is stressed out taking
     notes as: Coach Davis rewinds, plays, rewinds, plays, rewinds
     and plays the film from practice.

                         ASST. COACH DAVIS
               Y’gotta create more separation!
               Use your body! Damn it, Grier!

     Will, stressed out, leans back and catches eye contact with
     Rush...

          step up to the line, y’got this habit
          of leadin’ your route in advance.

          Next time you line up against him,
          eye the slant, then burn him deep.
          Deception, misdirection,
          surprise... You gotta set him up.

                    WILL
          I’ll work on it, thanks...
              (exasperated)
          Man, I just want a chance.

          field medic.

               it was one of the worst franchises
               in sports. But we turned the ship
               around. This season we have the
               personnel, but do we have the heart
               and the character to be winners?

          need, right?

Rush laughs and watches as: James sprints to Will and jumps
into his father’s arms. Lisa follows close behind, Will
kisses her then kisses the locket.

James shyly buries his head into Will’s chest.

          Like I told Will, us Detroit boys
          gotta stick together!

Rush inquisitively looks over at Tommy.    Tommy waves.

                    WILL
          That’s my brother, Tommy.

                    RUSH

                    WILL

          Something like that.

Rush’s eyes drift to the small FOOTBALL LOCKET dangling from
a SILVER CHAIN around Lisa’s neck.

Lisa turns away and walks to the Bronco...    Sore subject.

36   EXT. SOUTH CENTRAL - CUSTOM CAR REPAIR SHOP - NIGHT

     In a dangerous alley a 64 CAMARO parks behind a repair shop.
     From the shop’s rough appearance it’s safe to say this ain’t
                                            E

     AAA approved. Police sirens and dog barks permeate the air.

     Rush steps out of the car, THEN-- A very familiar Bronco
     pulls out of the garage. Rush locks eyes with the driver and
     sees it’s... TOMMY. The Bronco squeals out, leaving Rush to
     ponder, but a high pitched laugh breaks his train of
     thought...

     Rush turns to see DONTAY (40s, a man with natural menace),
     walk out of the garage with a devilish grin. Dontay tosses
     Rush a baked potato... Rush catches it, confused, then
     follows Dontay through repair shop’s rear entrance.

               Did Tommy mention any leads on the
               construction job?

     Lisa shakes her head no.

               Yeah...   At least he’s trying.

38   INT. NASHVILLE - CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Will, Rush, Slim, Mouse, and S-Bull hang in the VIP section of
     a high-end nightclub. Beautiful ladies dressed-to-kill turn
     heads as they walk by. Will is the least dressed-up for the

     club, and appears the most uncomfortable.

     The crew parks in a DARK PARKING LOT. They’re facing a
                          SG

     storefront about 50 yards away with no lights. The mood is
     rowdy, almost juvenile, as if they’re about to play a prank.

     Mouse hops out of the back and starts dressing. Rush reaches
     into a bag and hands out masks. Will is speechless, things
     are happening too fast for him to truly process.

               Yo chill, just follow our lead.

     Will watches his teammates slip on ski masks, and load up
     sawed-off shotguns... Will’s world starts to spin.

               No one’s gettin’ hurt, relax.
               We’re just gonna scare em.

     Rush then motions for Will to follow. The Masked Men jog
     across the parking lot to the back of a DARK BUILDING...
     Rush pulls out a screw driver and approaches a LOCKED DOOR.

     CLOSE ON a BUMP KEY in a lock, as the handle of a screwdriver
     TAPS GENTLY on the top of the makeshift key and CLICK.

     *INTERCUTTING AS NECESSARY THROUGHOUT THE SEQUENCE.

40   The crew enters through the back door, and down a steep flight
     of stairs to a basement DOOR. Rush turns to the crew, nods and
     opens the door to reveal:

41   A dimly-lit narrow hallway, with a dozen doors on each side...
     The eerily quiet hallway is overtaken by the instrumental sounds
     of ancient eastern meditation music.

     Rush gently opens a door where a half naked pot-bellied
     GEEZER lies on a table with his eyes closed. Next to him a
     Vietnamese WOMAN in a silk robe gently starts to massage him--

     She looks at Rush, who menacingly brings his index finger to
         LI

     his mouth, and gives her the universal “Shhh” sign. The crew
     continues down the dingy hallway as we hear “the moans and
     groans” of pay-for-sex, then...

     Rush pushes a door open-- It leads to more hallways...   Rush
     nods at Mouse and Slim to enter.

     Slim and Mouse nod, and vanish into the dark hallway, leaving
     Rush, S-Bull, and Will at the double doors.

42   INT. POKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
     Double doors KICK OPEN. The THREE MASKED ASSAILANTS EXPLODE
     into the room. Will’s eyes go BIG as:
     Startled faces of EIGHT WEALTHY ELDERLY MEN around a green
     felt POKER TABLE with LARGE STACKS OF CASH in front of each
     player, stare back at them, terrified.
     TWO formidable BALD BOUNCERS in suits charge the crew.
     S-BULL gives a vicious FOREARM SHIVER that sends one bouncer
     off his feet. The giant Samoan follows through and pancakes
     the bouncer against the wall.

     The other bouncer comes rushing at them with a STUN STICK,
     but Rush is too fast. He ducks under the parry, kicks out
     the man’s legs and slams him in the groin. Rush picks up the
     STUN STICK and JOLTS him.
     Player #1 goes for his weapon, but Will’s got him-- Will
     points the Glock at Player 1’s temple, who backs away from
     the gun. Will grabs the gun and hands it over to Rush.

     PANIC ensues throughout the brothel, as Asian WOMEN and their
     CLIENTS scatter about in the hallway.
     A SECURITY GUARD appears from a hallway, and fires his gun.
     S-Bull ducks for cover, and returns aim at the guard. Rush
     aims his shotgun at the guard too--
     The security guard drops his gun.    With the room now secure
     Rush moves to the next phase..

     Will takes off and we follow as: Will sprints through the
                    N

     dingy hallway, and back up the steps. He weaves and dodges
     panicked Women and Clients. The half naked Geezer bumps into
     Will-- He instinctively SLAMS the Geezer hard into the wall.
                        SG

     Rush orders a guard to lay flat on his stomach.

43   Down a hallway, Mouse leads with Slim trailing. They cut
     through a kitchen. Mouse spots a camera and BLASTS it on
     site. They approach a WALK-IN FREEZER and open it up. They
     walk to the back of the freezer... Slim pushes a tall cart
     of POTATOES out of the way to reveal: a secret DOOR.
     Slim opens the door to a HALLWAY. At the end of the hallway,
     a GUARD stands in front of a locked steel door. Before the
     GUARD can react BOOM! Mouse blasts his kneecap into
     oblivion, he reloads, and BLASTS the door lock off.

44   Rush has everything under control, the poker players
     practically pee their collective pants.

     The players vigorously shake their heads no.   S-Bull now
     aggressively packs $2 million into a bag.

45   Will bursts out of the back, sprints through the quiet
     parking lot, and hops in the van. He slams the door and
     starts the engine...

46   Mouse opens the door to reveal: a room of GIRLS in lingerie
     standing around a table of CASH. They stop stacking money
     and take cover under the table, terrified.

     Slim runs in and starts stuffing a bag with cash. Mouse
     walks up to a GIRL who’s shaking, scared and lost-- He drops
     a bag in front of her and orders, “Fill it up.” She obeys and
     quickly starts stuffing bills into the bag.
47   S-Bull finishes with the money and zips up the bag. Rush
     keeps a gun aimed on the poker players as he backs out of the
         LI

     room with S-Bull.

48   Slim zips up his bag and takes off. The Girl finishes and
           O

     zips the bag. She raises up it to Mouse... He shakes his
     head, “Take it and go!” Mouse follows Slim out...
                    N

     *DIRECTOR’S PRODUCTION NOTE, TIME PERMITTING: We’ll see the
     escape van pull up to a stop light-- As they nervously wait,
     a COP CAR pulls up. It’s a beat of pure tension, then red
                        SG

     and blue lights turn on-- The cops peel out with a U-Turn
     and drive the opposite way... PHEW.


49   INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

     The crew sits on beds, happily counting cash, except for Will,
     who stands in the corner, enraged-- Rush notices...

               No, I’m not all right!   What the
               fuck was that?!

                         RUSH
               We just collecting on some debts,
               that’s all.

                         WILL
               That’s all?! Bull shit!
     Will charges but Mouse intersects and gets in his face.

                         MOUSE
               You got a problem, Rook?!
                                                                32.


     Will shoves Mouse and throws a punch, but Mouse blocks--    He
     dances around like Ali and taunts Will with a wave.

                         MOUSE (CONT'D)
               Bring it, Bitch.

     Will stalks forward, cornering Mouse and WHAM! Rush grabs
     Will and pins him against the wall. Will struggles as Rush
     holds him down.

                         RUSH
               You gotta calm the fuck down. No
               one got hurt. No one’s in trouble.
               All we did was take a lil’ money
               from some assholes. If you got a
               problem with that, go ahead. Call
               the cops, but first take this.
         LI

     Rush shoves a duffle bag into Will’s chest and loosens his
     grip. Will swats Rush off him and exits with the bag.

     As Will grabs the door knob, he stops to listen...

                         RUSH (CONT'D)

               help you outta some debt and pay for

                                  AT

     Will exits, leaving Rush, S-Bull, Slim and Mouse in a room of
     silence. The crew is pissed, except Rush, who’s smiling...

               I told you, he ain’t the one.

     INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     Will stands outside the room. He unzips the bag to see it’s
     filled to gills with stacks of hundred dollar bills...


50   EXT. TENNESSEE STADIUM - SIDELINES - NEXT DAY

     It’s the 4th quarter. Will stands on the sideline, still
     reeling from the night before. He notices Rush staring at
     him and walks to the other end of the sideline...CRASH!

     The crowd erupts as a LINEBACKER smokes a RECEIVER crossing
     the field. Will turns toward the sound, the crowd now silent
     as the LA Receiver gets carried off.
                                                               33.

               Grier!   Let’s go!

     HOLY SHIT... The moment Will’s been fighting for has come--
     Any anxiety from the massage parlour gets evaporated by heart
     pounding adrenaline. Rush watches on as:

     HIGH SPEED: Will runs onto the field and joins the huddle.

     In the huddle, Grier catches his breath. Crane calls out the
     play and “BREAK!”. Before Will takes his spot--

                         PETER CRANE
               Better have magnets in your gloves,
               kid.
         LI

     Crane snaps it, drops back and spots Will wide open-- He
     flings the ball, but it’s an overthrow headed out of bounds..
           O

     Suddenly-- Will leaps from out of nowhere and catches it!

               winning field goal for LA.

               advantage of his playing time.
                                           E

     Rush, Mouse, Slim and the entire team erupt.    Crane gives
     Will big slap on the helmet.

                          COACH BRACKNEY
               17!

     Coach waves Will to the sidelines-- The receiver now
     healthy, runs back onto the field. Will makes it back to the
     sidelines and Coach slaps Will on the shoulder pads.


51   INT. TENNESSEE STADIUM - LOCKER ROOM - SHOWERS - AFTER GAME

     Will let’s the hot shower run over him as mixed emotions and
     steam swirl around him.
                                                              34.


52    Later... Will walks out wrapped in a towel and notices the
      corner TV:

52V   It shows highlights from the game, a graphic of DEREK SNOW
      pops up-- With a chyron reading: “REPORT, LA WORKING ON A
      DEAL TO BRING IN DEREK SNOW.”

      Will gets a punch in the gut... He notices Rush is watching
      the TV too. Rush returns to his locker, in that moment they
      inadvertently lock eyes. OFF Rush’s knowing look...


53    INT. FBI - OFFICE - SPECIAL TASK ROOM - NIGHT

      FEDERAL AGENTS buzz around the room with activity. This is
      the “special task” room assigned to Vidal’s investigation.

      Every wall has a corkboard covered with reports and
          LI

      information linked to the case. At one end there’s a big map
      with red tacks on each of the correlating cities.

      Hennessy and Park watching CCTV footage.

      Vidal bursts into the office and beelines it for Hennessy.
      Hennessy hands Vidal a folder.

      Vidal walks up to the map and places a red tack on NASHVILLE.


54    INT/EXT. RUSH’S BENTLEY - NIGHT

     In a BOX SUITE, Demarco is a bundle of nerves. He watches
     his team next to a sharply dressed agent, KIT JACOBS.

60   On the field Will stands behind Coach, praying for an

       Lisa, James and Tommy watch the game. James jumps and down

elderly man in a wheelchair, thee CHET WALCOTT (56). Chet

Chet, Will notices pens scattered all over the floor.

          Rush, those puzzles you’ve been
          sending have really helped. He

     Will, Lisa, and Tommy arrive in awe of how SPECTACULAR the
     place is. Rush greets them at the door. Tommy and Rush have
     a quiet stare down, but Lisa and Will are too blown away by

     Carla takes Lisa by the hand and Tommy follows. Will looks
     at Rush, like “DAMN”. Rush laughs... He knows she’s fine.

75   INT. RUSH’S MANSION - A LITTLE LATER

     Rush leads Will past expensive ART along the hallway upstairs.
     Will stops and leans over the balcony, taking it all in.

     Will nods... There’s a moment of silence, distant laughter
     from the party softly pours into their room--

               You’ve seen my sanctuary, now you
               gotta see the heart beat.

76   They walk down the steps, leading to a steel DOOR. Rush
     opens it up to reveal: An indoor GUN RANGE. On a table
     there’s a few AR-15’s, PISTOLS and a SHOTGUN. Rush walks up
     to the AR-15 and picks it up.

                         RUSH (CONT'D)
               I bet you never seen one of these.

     Will picks an AR-15 up, examines it. Then like clock work,
     he loads, cocks it, CHUCHAK and aims. Braap-Braap-Braap! He
     nails a TARGET twice in the head and twice in the chest.

                         WILL
               Yeah, never seen one of these.

     Off Rush’s smile--

82   INT. HOTEL - SUITE - DAYS LATER

     We FLOAT over carts with silver serving trays-- We continue
     through, passing a plethora of Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Versace
     suits hanging on portable clothing racks, then finally, we
     find standing in a semi-circle:

     Rush, Slim, S-Bull, Mouse suited like GQ models.   They talk
     amongst themselves and laugh with excitement...

     From a side room, Will walks out like he’s on a runway and
     does a spin. The guys crack up and mob him.
         LI

     Rush has the TAILOR take a photo of them, they pose. SNAP.

     Rush turns to Will and gives him a black box.   Will opens it
     and it’s a black Audemars Piguet WATCH.

                          RUSH

83   INT. GRIER HOME - BEDROOM - DAY

     Lisa walks into the bedroom to find: 3 BEAUTIFUL DRESSES

               Will!   What is all this?!

     Will pops his head in the doorway and enters the room, smirking.

                         WILL
               We’re attending a Gala, and it’s
               kinda fancy... I would be honored

     Over the night sky, spotlights criss-cross back and forth
     above a star studded event. Luxury vehicles of all shapes

     Cameras flash as ATHLETES and CELEBRITIES pose in front of a
     step and repeat for the “20th ANNUAL LA SPORTS UNITED FOR ALL
     GALA”. Notably, Jerry Dermarco poses on the carpet with
     Peter Crane, Derek Snow and the MAYOR of Los Angeles.

     WILL’S LAMBO TRUCK pulls up to VALET. Will and Lisa step out
     looking incredible-- Perfectly suited and dressed for the
     extravagant occasion.


85   INT. HOTEL - BALLROOM - LATER

     Will and Lisa enter a giant ballroom filled with over a
     hundred tables. SPORTS LEGENDS of old, as well as CURRENT
     PLAYERS and EXECUTIVES mull around and mingle.

     Smiling and overwhelmed, Lisa gives Will a look as if she’s
     in a fairytale.

     With the Gala now well underway-- Rush, Will, S-Bull, Mouse
     and Slim enjoy their dinner and laugh with their ladies..

     TIME GOES BY... Lisa holds Will’s hand at the table,

     From across the table Rush watches as: Will turns to find Kit
     strutting over. Will stands up and introduces Lisa to Kit.

               back, is the number I can get you
               if you keep ballin’.

     Will looks at the card and nearly shits himself.   He hands
     the card to Lisa, who’s now dumbstruck.

                         KIT JACOBS (CONT'D)
               Can we have a second?

     Will looks at Lisa, her eyes urge Will to go. Will obliges
     and follows Kit to a private corner. Rush watches on...

     Lisa nods and gets in the truck. Rush and Will watch the
     truck drive off--   Rush motions for Will to follow and they
     walk behind a building.

          over   what some dude in a suit wrote

91   INT. SOUTH CENTRAL LA - CUSTOM CAR REPAIR SHOP - NIGHT

     Rush walks past cars in different stages of repair.

     NOW IN A BACK OFFICE, In contrast to the dirty repair shop,
     Dontay’s office is super clean and expensive-- Leather
     couches, fine carpet and state of the art TVs line the walls.

     Rush sits across a desk, watching Dontay carefully roll a
     blunt. Behind Rush, a few of Dontay’s muscle/homies chill on
     couches in a cloud of smoke.

                         DONTAY

                         WALKER
               You expect me to believe members of
               a football team, a professional
               football team, are committing armed
               robberies around the country at
               their away games? That’s the
               craziest thing I’ve ever heard!

               for Snow. Let’s see if he can pick
               up where he’s left off.

98   Crane hikes it drops back to pass. Will sprints WIDE OPEN,
     it’s gonna be a touchdown, the ball slowly spirals into
     Will’s hands and HE DROPS IT--

                 Hopefully he can brush that one
                 off.

                           COLOR ANALYST (V.O.)
                 He should have walked into the end
                 zone for a score and he knows it.

Will’s knee bounces like an anxious jack hammer.

                    RUSH
          Too much money on the line and
          we’ve planned all year for this.

Mouse pulls a heavy duffle bag out from the trunk.

ZIIIIP. The duffle bag opens to reveal a stash of AR-15’s.
Mouse passes Slim and Will a duffle bag to strap on.

              (to Will)
          If we do it right, this shit will
          be easier than Nashville. Don’t
          let the scenery scare you. Just
                                      E

          stick with me and follow my lead.

          That van has a safe with 6
          compartments. Each one with at
          least 2 mill of that prick’s money.
          Just focus, one at a time.
              (to Mouse)
          Start bagging as soon as you can.

Mouse hands out AR-15’s and ski-masks to Will and Slim.
Will’s knee starts bouncing again.

      Slim gives Will a reassuring pat on the back, and hands Rush
      the final AR-15 and ski-mask.

                    (re: AR-15)

                S-Bull, as soon as there’s daylight
                hit that hole and go.

      Rush takes a final look at the map.

                          RUSH (CONT'D)
                We’re a mile away from our new

      Slim shows Will and Mouse the pick up spot on the GPS.   Rush
      pulls the ski-mask over his face and they follow suit.
                         SG

      CHUCHAK. Rush cocks his AR-15 followed by Slim, Mouse and
      Will with a loud simultaneous, CHUCHAK. Will notices his
      knee bouncing and halts it. Deep breath. Rush nods at Will
      and CLICK-CLICK. The SUV unlocks.

      The three passenger doors pop open and with it, time slows...


116   EXT. TUNNEL - FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS
                                             E

      HIGH SPEED: Under the fluorescent orange glow of the tunnel
      light-- Rush, Slim, Mouse and Will walk out looking like the
      four horsemen of the apocalypse.

      The visual is ICONIC. The armed thieves prowl through the
      rows of traffic, lions on the hunt.

117   DOWN THE ROAD-- 100 yards past the    tunnel, the broke down
      car that caused traffic gets pushed   to the shoulder. The
      lanes free up and cars finally jolt   forward. On the other
      side of the lane, headed toward us,   we notice an AMBULANCE...

118   To the right of S-Bull a tatted up MAN in a pimped out
      CHALLENGER, glares right at him. The man leans down and
      reaches under his seat. This causes S-Bull to lower his
      window and the man lowers his.
                                                                71.


                          S-BULL
                Yo Homie, now’s not the time to be
                a hero... We not here for that.

      S-Bull raises a glock for good measure.   The man concedes.

119   Rush crosses to the left and crouches down to avoid the Body
      Guard’s eye line. He lines the SUV in his cross-hairs and
      signals for Slim and Mouse to advance forward.

                          RUSH
                Rook, take the back.   On my signal,
                light it up.

      Cars in front of the armored VAN move forward.

      Will creeps up behind the SUV. In the BG screams permeate
      the tunnel as people begin to realize what’s happening.
          LI

      Through the front windshield Guard 1 and Guard 2 see Mouse
      and Slim creep up to the armored van.

                           RUSH
                Now!

      Braaap-Braap-Braap-Braap-Braap! The SUV’s driver side and
      rear window explode. Rush’s cold eyes glow from the hot
                                     AT

      muzzle flash, as he unloads a symphony of bullets and paints
      the SUV with smoking lead.

      Slim and Mouse take out the VAN’s tires, POP-POP! The van
      accelerates, it’s smoking tires squeal forward and the van
                                           E

      SLAMS into a car with reckless abandon.

      The tunnel erupts into absolute CHAOS. It’s a fight for
      survival as vehicles transform into bumper cars.

120   MEANWHILE at the FBI Field Office, Vidal, Hennessy and the
      Field Agent study a collage of targets pinned on a corkboard.

                          VOICE (O.S.)
                Shots fired, shots fired. 10-65 in

121   Rush slides over a car hood with fire in his eyes. He steps
      through a plume of smoke and sidles up to the passenger
      window-- Rush fires a round into the tunnel ceiling.

                          RUSH
                I wanna see your hands!

      Rush opens the driver door and grabs Guard 1 by the neck.

      Will keeps Guard 2 and Guard 3 frozen stiff with his gun
      trained on both of them.

      Mouse and Slim circle the armored van-- The VAN DRIVER opens
      the door and fires, BANG-BANG-BANG! Slim dives out the way
      and crawls behind a car.

      The Van Driver takes aim at Rush... And Rush quickly turns
      to use Guard 1 as a human shield, BANG-BANG-BANG! Bullets
          LI

      rip into Guard 1’s chest.

      Mouse rises up with his gun aimed at the stunned Van Driver.

                Drop it!

      Guard 1’s limp body falls to the ground, and the stunned Van
      Driver drops the gun. Suddenly-- VAN PASSENGER pops out and
                           SG

      fires at Rush, BANG-BANG! Rush takes cover as bullets ping
      off the SUV.

      Will has a clear shot on the Van Passenger, WHAM! Slim
      knocks the passenger out with the butt of this gun.
                                   AT

      Slim zip ties the passenger’s arms behind his back, and pats
      around till finding a key...

      Rush and Will have Guard 2 and 3 dead to rights. Rush barks
                                           E

      orders with fierce authority. Guard 2 carefully exits the
      SUV, then Rush tosses zip ties to Will...

                          RUSH
                Tie him up!

122   Meanwhile Slim unlocks the back door of the armored van and
      steps inside, revealing: The metal mobile safe with 6 locked
      compartments...

      Slim pulls out an industrial strength power drill from his
      backpack. He lines up the drill on the first compartment...

      The drill begins to twirl and BZZZZZZZ, slowly pushing into
      the thick steel. Metal shavings fall from the smoking hole.
                                                                  73.


123   In front of S-Bull, a path begins to form and he readies his
      foot over the gas pedal.

124   Police sirens in the distance steadily approach...   Rush
      appears behind Slim at the back of the van--

                          RUSH (CONT'D)
                We gotta move!

                          SLIM
                I’m moving, I’m moving.

125   Rush walks back to the SUV and finds Guard 3 cowering in his
      seat. Rush opens the door, Guard 3 jumps toward the other
      door, BRAAAP! Rush blasts a warning shot and glass shatters.

                          RUSH
                You wanna try that again?!
          LI

      Guard 3 violently shakes his head “no”.   Rush reaches in, and
      slams him onto the pavement.

      Will nods, and turns to watch for any potential threat.
                         SG

126   We follow Mouse into the back of the van. The drill BZZZZZ’s
      deep and POP. The first compartment swings open. Slim moves
      to the next compartment while Mouse starts sliding stacks of
      cash into his backpack.
                                     AT

127   Rush digs his gun into Guard 3’s back, he wails in pain.
      Rush pulls out a zip tie and ties him up.

128   Will’s eyes process the half mile of chaos. People scatter
      like cockroaches in the light. Will gets distracted when the
                                              E

      TAHOE engine REVS and ROARS. He turns to see: S-Bull punch
      the gas--

      The Tahoe swerves left, swerves right and snakes through the
      traffic. A car pulls in front of him, partially blocking his
      next move... S-Bull accelerates and PLOWS through it!

      The SUV breaks free, and whooshes past the roadside robbery.

                             MOUSE
                Rook!

129   Will’s attention snaps from S-Bull’s great escape to Mouse.

                             MOUSE (CONT'D)
                Switch me!

      Mouse hands Will a backpack full of cash, and takes Will’s
      backpack. Mouse sprints back to the van.

                          WILL
                    (to Rush)
                We got company!     5-0!

130   Rush looks toward Will and sees Red and Blue lights glowing
      at the end of the tunnel.

                             RUSH
                Shit.

131   S-Bull passes the stuck AMBULANCE and eventually clears the
      tunnel. He takes the first road leading into the woods...

132   At the other end of the tunnel a swarm of COP CARS are stuck
      at the entrance, blocked from any chance of getting in.
          LI

      Vidal, Hennessy, and the Field Agent step out an unmarked car
      wearing bullet proof vests-- They charge down the tunnel as
            O

      screaming pedestrians run past them.

133   The drill continues to BZZZZZ and POP-- The compartment
                     N

      opens. Mouse steps inside with the empty bag, and starts
      shoveling money. Rush appears.

      Mouse cleans the compartment out, ties the bag up, and exits.
      Slim ignores Rush, he now lines the drill up on the next

                That money’s gonna do us no good in
                prison!

      Rush fumes with anger and anxiously backs away.   Mouse
      returns to see Slim still drilling.

134   It’s chaotic, camera shaky as: Feet pound down the street.
      Under the orange glow of tunnel light-- Vidal, Hennessy, and
      a group of cops are in full sprint.

135   Through a thicket of wrecked cars, Rush spots the group of
      cops charging down the tunnel.

      He lines up his AR-15 and applies suppression fire, Braap-
      Braap-Braap! The cops fall to the ground and take cover.

      Mouse and Will sprint away.

      Heavy breathing. Pounding steps. Will and Slim sprint past

136   Vidal, Hennessy and a host of COPS finally arrive at the
      bullet riddled SUV.

      BANG-BANG! The bullets miss and ping off the armored van.

      Mouse peaks over a car to see: Vidal and Hennessy carefully
      approach the armored van... Rush sees them too.

                          RUSH (CONT'D)

      As Slim continues to sweep cash into the bag, Rush unloads
      more suppression fire, Braap-Braap-Braap-Braap!

      Rush turns and sees Slim finally exit the van. Slim sprints
      out with an unzipped duffle bag-- Now ready, Rush takes off
      in a dead sprint... Slim turns a corner and nearly trips,
      CASH spills all over the road.

                          SLIM

      One bullet pings off the van and one nails Slim in the leg.
      He topples over and falls onto the pile of cash.

137   Near the exit, Will spots the AMBULANCE stuck between cars on
      the other side... He has an idea.

138   With his AR-15 ready for war, Rush charges with fire and
      anger-- He spots Hennessy appear from behind a car, Braap-
      Braap-Braap!

      Vidal takes cover behind an open car door, she turns and sees
      in HIGH SPEED: Hennessy take three bullets to the chest.
      Hennessy collapses lifelessly into the road median. Vidal
      catches Hennessy and stops her head from SMACKING pavement.

                          VIDAL
                NO!!!

      Vidal holds her for a second, sets her down and angrily
      returns fire-- Rush takes cover, but reappears with the AR-
      15, and applies more suppression fire. Vidal ducks.

      Rush reaches Slim and helps him up. He carries Slim forward,
      and gets them both cover behind a car. Rush takes a breath.

      Mouse takes cover behind a car near Rush and Slim.

                          MOUSE
                    (to Rush)
                Go-go-go. I’ll cover you!

      Rush turns to Slim, who’s in bad shape, leaned against the
      car. Slim blinks his eyes, attempting not to pass out--
      Blood pours from his leg onto the street.
                           RUSH
                Slim.   Listen to me.      You here?
                             SLIM
                I’m here..     I’m here.
          LI

                          RUSH
                I need you to give me everything
                you got.. Cuz we’re getting on
            O

                that fucking plane. For your son,
                Slim. You hear me?! Gotta make it
                out of this tunnel for your son.
                     N

      Slim perks up and nods his head.      He’s got this.   Rush helps
      Slim up and time slows.
                          SG

139   Shot out of a cannon, Slim sprints through the fluorescent
      tunnel. Numb to the pain as adrenaline carries him forward.
      It’s pure chaos-- Camera shaky as Cops from every angle take
      aim at Slim and Rush. Bullets ping all around them.
                                     AT

140   Mouse pivots around the car and fires at the swarm of cops,
      Braap-Braap-Braap-Braap! Vidal dives down for cover.

141   Will hops over the median, and sprints through cars to the
                                               E

      AMBULANCE. He rips the door open to find a PARAMEDIC
      texting. She screams and drops her phone. Will grabs a
      first-aid kit, and takes off.

142   Will sprints up the road, takes a sharp right into the woods,
      and exits the chaos...

143   In the Tahoe, S-Bull drives along the quiet woods and pulls
      over to his marked location.

144   Slim sprints through the rows of cars.      Rush follows behind
      with Mouse making up some ground.

145   CLOSE ON: HENNESSY’s FACE. We pull out to see her bloody,
      and lifeless body slumped against the median.
                                                                78.


      With eyes full of anger and sadness, Vidal attempts to stop
      the bleeding from her lifeless partner. She rips the sleeve
      off her shirt, and ties it around Hennessy’s wound. Vidal
      screams out words like “PARAMEDIC”, STAY WITH ME” and “HELP”.

146   In the woods, Rush and Mouse carry Slim. With the adrenaline
      worn off, he’s no longer able to move. Slim’s starting to
      faint from the loss of blood.

147   The SUV’s parked on a shoulder. In the distance, a
      helicopter approaches with a search light scouring the area.

      In the SUV, S-Bull looks at his watch.   Beats of silence feel
      like a lifetime... THUD.

      S-Bull sees Will through the rearview mirror. CLICK-CLICK.
      Will opens the trunk and lowers back seats to make room for a
      make shift hospital bed.
          LI

                          S-BULL
                You guys good?
            O

      Will doesn’t answer.
                     N

148   In the tunnel, Vidal falls back against the median next to
      Hennessy. The emotion and exhaustion setting in. Cops storm
      past her in the hopeless pursuit of the criminals.
                         SG

149   S-Bull looks through the passenger window to see Mouse and
      Rush emerge from the woods carrying Slim.

                                    AT

                Put him in the back.   I’ll stop the
                bleeding.

      Rush and Mouse lie Slim down in the trunk.
                                            E

      The helicopter circles the tunnel. From above we follow the
      SUV pull off and vanish into the dark.

150   INT. TAHOE - DRIVING - A LITTLER LATER
      Slim’s bleeding badly... Will’s focused and in control.
                          WILL
                I got you, Slim.   Get him elevated!
      Mouse helps lift his head.   Will rips open Slim’s pant leg
      and studies his wound.
                                                                79.

                stop this bleedin’ before he goes
                into shock.
      CLOSE ON thick amounts of BLOOD oozing out.
                          WILL (CONT'D) (CONT'D)
                Rush, press down hard!
      Rush applies pressure on the leg as Slim SCREAMS out.

151   Will grabs a bottle and tears open bandages.    He successfully
      bandages it up and stops the bleeding.

      trickle onto the plane... At last, Rush, Mouse, S-Bull,
      Will, and Slim appear. They’re sweaty and beat. Slim looks
      like a ghost as they head to the back.

153   LATER... The flight well underway, the lights now off and
      the air is calm. Will is sitting next to Rush.

      Slim’s in the back covered in blankets. Rush refills his
      glass with SCOTCH and notices Will staring at Slim.

                come down with a bad case of the flu.

                Should buy us some time...

      Will’s not so sure about that.    Rush takes a long swig of his
      scotch. Then...

                Toughest cop in Detroit. They used

                always pop up in the middle of a
                crime, said he haunted the streets.
                Well one night he finds these young
                punks rippin’ off a liquor store.
                He chases one of 'em 18 blocks and
                corners him in an alley. The kid
                turns around and has a gun. Pop,
                he just freezes. He says, "Why,
                Son?" That young punk shrugged it
                all off and said, "I like the
                rush." My ol’ man, he just nodded

                you no longer deserve mine." I
                never saw him after that. Even
                when I went legit. High school
                ball. College. Even the pros.

                Muthafucka died 10 years ago and
                “The Ghost” still haunts me to this
                day.

      Rush leans back, and dozes off with a full glass of scotch in
      his hand... Will’s speechless.

      Will notices a NEWS CHANNEL playing on the TV, “SAN FRAN

156   EXT. WOODS -   MACARTHUR TUNNEL - NEXT DAY

      An unmarked government car pulls up, Vidal steps out from the
      passenger side. Thunder and lightening CRACK in the distance

                this. I hope we can agree that we
                should choose the productive route.

      Vidal glares at Walker with a burning mixture of rage and
      sadness... Instead of picking a fight, she gives him a NOD.

       Impossible to be happy or care about football, he picks up

       Will hangs up... THEN, an incoming call from KIT JACOBS
       comes in. He denies it.

                          RUSH
                I need you to lay low, stay out of
                sight for a few days.

      Slim nods. Off that Rush gives him a big hug and steps away
      to let Slim wipe away tears with his shirt.

      Rush slides a GLOCK out from the back of his waistband and
      lines it up at Slim’s temple... BANG! Slim collapses.

      CLOSE ON: RUSH’s FACE, a tear wells up and falls...


167   INT. LOS ANGELES - FBI FIELD OFFICE - LATE NIGHT

      CLOSE ON: A DIGITAL MUG SHOT OF RUSH
                                                        92.


Back out to reveal we’re at the digital tech table displaying
a large collection of mug shots along with rap sheets
including: RUSH, SLIM, MOUSE, S-BULL and others-- Kizinski
crosses over to Vidal.

                    VIDAL
          Any matches?

                    KIZINSKI
          Not yet, still got a few to
          process.

                    VIDAL
          Somehow we gotta whittle this to 4.

Vidal and Kizinski watch mug shots go by as an AGENT scrolls.

                    KIZINSKI
    LI

          On the 53 man roster there’s at
          least nine felonies and 18 priors.
          That’s just the team.

                    VIDAL
          Pull up the tunnel CCTV.
               N

The special agent taps the table twice-- FOOTAGE pops up:
SLIM sprinting through the row of cars. PARK abruptly enters
                   SG

the room with a folder, and stands next to Vidal.

                    PARK
              (re: folder)
          We got something.

                    VIDAL
          A hit?

Vidal’s eyes stay on the footage and motions for the folder.
                                     E

Park hands it over.

                    PARK
          Not exactly... We’ve received all
          results for the players we pulled..
          Except for one, Bobby Sanders, AKA,
          “Slim”. Played in last Sunday’s
          game, yet popped up on this week’s
          Injury Report.

Vidal turns from the footage to the folder.

                    PARK (CONT'D)
          He’s listed as having an
          undisclosed illness. Hasn’t
          reported to the team facility all
          week.
                                                                   93.


                            VIDAL
                  What position is he?

       Vidal, Park and Kizinski both look at the footage of Slim
       running in slo-mo...

                               KIZINKSKI
                  Tight end.

                            VIDAL
                  Can we pull up highlights?

       The Agent does a few taps on the table and WHAM. A clip of
       SLIM in his uniform runs with the football. It plays SIDE BY
       SIDE with tunnel footage... It’s a perfect match.

                            VIDAL (CONT'D)
                  Get me everything on Sanders, now.

168    INT/EXT. LOS ANGELES - FOOTBALL STADIUM - GAME DAY
              O

       OVER HEAD-- It’s a sun-filled day with the SIGHTS and SOUNDS
       of an energized CROWD pulsating in LA’s FOOTBALL STADIUM.
                      N

                            TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                  We’re live from Los Angeles where a
                           SG

                  crowd of playoff-starved fans have
                  gathered to see Peter Crane lead
                  his team to LA’s first playoff
                  victory in 10 years!
       *FOOTBALL STADIUM SEQUENCE WE WILL INTERCUT AS NECESSARY
                                       AT

169    LOCKER ROOM, Will readies himself. As he closes his locker,
       he sees a framed picture of LISA and JAMES...
170    OWNER’S BOX, in his ivory tower, Demarco looks down on his
                                               E

       dominion below, surrounded by waspy old money friends. They
       look like super villains as they toast champagne flutes--
                            JERRY DEMARCO
                  In 4 quarters we’ll find out which
                  billionaire owns the best!
171/172 IN THE STANDS, Tommy watches from the crowd as the crowd
        ERUPTS-- The away team kicks off to Los Angeles.
173    We track along the sideline spotting Rush in a jumpsuit, then
       S-Bull, Mouse and finally... Will, who takes the field for
       their first offensive possession...
174    Crane gets under center, “Green 42. Green 42-GO!”. The
       linemen CRASH into each other as Crane drops back... The
       sounds and images morph and fad into a time cut.
                                                                 94.


175   LISA’S MOM’S HOUSE, Lisa nervously watches the game with
      James by her side.
                          TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                We’re nearing halftime and these
                two teams haven’t been able to get
                any separation. We’re locked in a
                tight one as LA trails 10 to 3.
                Ernie what’s the key for LA as they
                attempt to put up some points
                before half.
                          COLOR ANALYST (V.O.)
                They’ve had some key injuries this
                season, but found themselves a
                Cinderella-story-receiver in Will
                Grier. If they can get him going,
                he could be the X-factor today.
          LI

      James perks up at the sound of his dad’s name.
176   ON THE FIELD, LA receives the punt and the OFFENSE runs out--
            O

      ANGLE ON: GAME CLOCK - 2nd Quarter - 5:21
177   Mouse stares at the clock, knee bouncing. His eyes drift
                     N

      down sideline finding Rush-- Who calmly exits to the tunnel.

178   They’re on a drive-- Crane’s in the pocket. Downfield he
                         SG

      finds Will, streaking wide open and launches it, the BALL
      spirals perfectly toward Will, but bounces helplessly off his
      finger tips. The crowd groans.

                          TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                                     AT

                Crane has a man open down the
                sidelines...and it’s...OFF THE
                HANDS of Will Grier! Oh Brother!
                Everyone in the stadium thought
                they had a touchdown on that one!

                And the miscues continue for Grier.
                That was the perfect opportunity
                for LA to tie this game up! Has
                LA’s new chariot turned into a
                pumpkin..?
      As Will lines up, he takes a peak at the clock now at 3:57...


179   EXT. SLIM’S TOWNHOUSE - SAME
      Vidal pulls up in a black DODGE CHARGER with TWO COP CARS.
      Vidal jogs up the porch, followed by FOUR COPS in tactical
      gear. In contrast to the noisy stadium, this dead quiet
      neighbored is eerie-- Vidal knocks, BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG.
                                                                  95.

                          Vidal
                Mr. Sanders!

      The cops part like the red sea, a BIG COP storms up with a
      steel ram and blasts the door off it’s hinges.
180   The tactical cops sweep the house for any sign of life-- WE
      FOLLOW Vidal up a flight of stairs. With her gun aimed, she
      proceeds cautiously... You could hear a pin drop.
      Vidal creeps into the bedroom and her EYES say it all...     On
      a stark white carpet, Slim lays limp in a pool of blood.


181   INT/EXT. DODGE CHARGER - DRIVING

      BLUE LIGHTS flash as the Charger zooms.    Vidal’s on the
      phone, looking determined.

                         SG

      Crane uncorks a throw and finds Will. The crowd roars as he
      catches the ball and crosses the 50 yard line--
183   It’s cut short when he goes down limping. A whistle stops
      the action... TRAINER’s check on Will, the crowd goes
      silent.
                                   AT

                          TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                Those non-contact injuries are
                always the scariest.

                          COLOR ANALYST (V.O.)
                You’re right, Jim. Hate seeing a
                player drop like that. Let’s hope
                it’s not a muscle tear.
184   In the stands, Tommy watches on as Will’s carried off by S-
      Bull and Mouse...

      Meanwhile, somewhere deep in the stadium’s employee TUNNEL,
      a MAN in a white painter suit, pushes a wheelbarrow toward a
      FREIGHT ELEVATOR-- He reaches the elevator, parks the
      wheelbarrow, and inserts a silver key into a slot...DING.

      The Painter enters, turns, finally revealing it’s RUSH. His
      face is hidden by a black ski mask with a white and chrome
      painter respirator mask over it.
                                                               96.


185   TRAINING ROOM, Will’s helped onto the trainer’s table by S-
      Bull and Mouse. They exit and give Will a nod. The TRAINER
      starts to feel his hamstring.
                          TRAINER
                How’s that feel?
                          WILL
                    (emotional)
                Could you give me a moment?
      The trainer understands and leaves. Will watches the trainer
      exit, then looks toward the doorway on the other side-- As a
      dark shadow approaches and grows, Will’s heart beat quickens.
186   OWNER’S BOX, Jerry Demarco and Kit Jacobs watch as the
      Seattle makes a FIELD GOAL. Demarco curses.
      ANGLE ON: GAME CLOCK - 2nd Quarter - 0:00
          LI

                          TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                And it’s good! Seattle answers
            O

                with a field goal before half. We
                got a tight one on our hands,
                folks. Let’s see if LA can regroup
                and get some offense going in the
                     N

                2nd half.
                         SG

187   CLOSE ON: RUSH’s COLD CALM EYES...
      FREIGHT ELEVATOR, Slim and Mouse appear from a corner and
      join Rush. The air’s filled with rhythmic ventilated
      breathing as they wait...
                                    AT

      *Through the painter masks their voices have a reverberated
      muffle quality to it, a less extreme version of BANE’s voice.
188   Finally Will appears down the hall and makes it to the
      elevator. Once inside Rush pushes a button, the doors shut,
                                           E

      and a mechanical whir initiates their deep descent into the
      stadium’s bowels.
      Will’s anxious eyes watch: Rush dig under the tarp in the
      wheelbarrow and pull out FOUR SILENCER PISTOLS--
      He hands one to Slim, Mouse and Will, who studies it with
      some “oh shit” type curiosity.
                          RUSH
                Everybody got the green light...
                    (re: silencers)
                    But we stay quiet...
                    (nods to Mouse)
                If we need to go loud.

      Mouse pulls up the tarp to reveal: a stack of AR-15s
                                                                 97.


                          RUSH (CONT'D)
                I brought some noise.
                    (checks watch)
                20 minutes. Get as much cash as
                you can but if I say go...

      Everyone nods.   They know what he means by that....

                          RUSH (CONT'D)
                Will stay with Mouse. Just like
                the tunnel, follow and listen.

      The long whir stops with a THUD.   The doors slide open.
189   We follow the ARMORED TRUCK as it passes a GATE GUARD, and
      through the GATED ENTRANCE. The van goes deeper and deeper
      into the belly of the stadium, leading to the VAULT.
          LI

190   BASEMENT 3 - PRIVATE ENTRANCE, it’s all concrete down here.
      Mouse pushes the wheelbarrow. Rush and S-Bull walk on either
      side of him with their SILENCERS, they turn a corner and see:
            O

      A chrome private ELEVATOR where a SECURITY GUARD watches the
      halftime show on a corner TV.
                       N

      On Rush’s cold and focused face, he takes aim and pop-pop-
      pop. Will’s eyes go big, witnessing the cold blooded murder.
                          SG

      Rush pulls out a key card, places it on a sleek panel, and
      waits while-- S-Bull picks up the guard and holds his face
      to the retina scanner... Double-Protected.
      After a few tense beats, the chrome elevator door opens.
                                    AT

191   CLOSE ON VAULT DOOR WHEEL. In the BG we hear a series of
      beeps then a loud metal THUNK-- The giant steel wheel spins
      and opens to reveal a money mausoleum.
                                            E

      In the middle, there’s four steel tables with every square
      inch covered in a 2 foot stack of CASH-- It’s enough to make
      Scrooge McDuck sweat.
192   Outside the vault, a TRUCK GUARD opens the back door of the
      Armored Truck to reveal: FIVE pallets of CASH-- Rush steps
      out of a dark corner and pop-pop, drops the guard.
      Spooked-- TWO GUARDS turn around and pop-pop-pop-pop. Just
      like that THREE guards down. From the dark corners of the
      concrete cave, Slim, Mouse and Will jog up.
      It’s frenetic yet focused-- The ticking clock weighs on them
      as the truck duo and vault duo fill up bags with cash.
      At this point it’s nothing short of efficient perfection...
                                                               98.

193   OWNER’S BOX, Demarco sits next to the GM. He’s still fuming
      from the field goal. He glares at the SINGER, as she rocks
      out for halftime on the 50 yard line.
      ANGLE ON: (ticking) CLOCK   - 0:53 TILL 3rd QUARTER

194   In the vault, Mouse ZIPS up the bag and looks to WILL.
          LI

                          MOUSE
                Yo Rook, get these bags out.
            O

      Will loads a bag onto his back then labors out.

      CLOSE ON: PAVEMENT a full DUFFLE BAG lands with a THUD next
                     N

      to another FULL BAG-- IN the BG we see a GUARD slowly move.
195   FLOOR V - LOBBY, Will breathes hard, as he drags the bag
                         SG

      across the floor. He almost falls from the weight on his
      back. He stops to catch a breath and notices how isolated
      and quiet it is... Suddenly he gets an idea..

      Will walks over to a trash can, pulls the bag and dumps all
      the trash out. Next, he unzips both bags and starts pulling
                                    AT

      cash evenly from each bag... His eyes dart around wildly as
      he stuffs the trash bag with cash.

      Will pulls a chair up to a giant LA FOOTBALL EMBLEM, lifts
                                            E

      the ceiling panel and places the garbage bag in there--
      Lastly, Will pulls out a BURNER PHONE and takes a picture of
      the EMBLEM...

196   STADIUM - ON THE FIELD, the crowd roars as LA kicks off to
      begin the second half....

197   PRIVATE ENTRANCE ROAD, the Gate Guard drives down the steep
      dark tunnel in a Security CART.

                          GATE GUARD
                    (into radio)
                Hey Ralph, what’s going on down
                there? You’re 5 minutes behind.
198   In the truck, S-Bull zips the last bag and tosses it to the
      ground. S-Bull then looks up to see Mouse--
                                                              99.

                          S-BULL
                Yo Mouse, you goo-
      Pop. S-Bull falls forward and SMACKS face first onto the
      concrete next to his duffle bag... Rush steps out from the
      shadows and hops out of the truck-- But the shocking moment
      is cut by a pair of headlights...

199   Down the ramp, the Gate Guard anxiously approaches in his
      Security Cart... He sees the trail of blood and dead Guard.
      The cart reverses back as fast as it can-- Mouse and Rush
      both unload their SILENCERS, pop-pop-pop-pop. Every shot
      misses as the cart whips around and disappears up the ramp.
200   FLOOR V - LOBBY, Will stands by the elevator... A WHITE
      STROBE LIGHT FLASHES with a high-pitched alarm ringing
      throughout the concrete cave. Will looks around, panicked.
          LI

      Around the corner, Rush comes sprinting, followed by Mouse
      pushing the wheelbarrow.
            O

                          WILL
                What the fuck happened???

                          RUSH
                He’s gonna meet us up top.
                                     AT

201   Now with Vidal’s CHARGER, there’s a swarm of COP CARS
      trailing behind... In the passenger seat, Vidal stares at
      the STADIUM where it all ends.
202   DING. The elevator opens. Mouse pushes ahead with the wheel
                                             E

      barrow, followed by Rush and Will each dragging a bag out.

      As Will pulls his first bag out, he notices the TV in the
      corner. It’s the MIDDLE OF THE 3rd QUARTER!!!

203   At Lisa’s Mom’s house, Lisa sits anxiously, BUZZ-BUZZ. She
      looks over to see a TEXT from a random number... Too anxious
      to look at it, she turns the phone over.
204   WE FOLLOW MOUSE wheeling into the DRAINAGE tunnel. The
      area’s a damp industrial maze of pipes going every which way.
      This area should be pitch black, but the STROBE LIGHT pulses
      like a heart beat-- Mouse sees down the long tunnel, SUN
      LIGHT streaming through a 6 x 6 IRON STEEL GRATE...
      As Mouse approaches, he sees through the GRATE, a field of
      grass and a BLACK SUV with CARLA opening the trunk doors.
                                                               100.

      Mouse wastes no time, and pulls out a hand WET SAW from the
      wheelbarrow and fires it up-- BZZZZZZ.

205   Will drags the bag toward the drainage tunnel. In the BG we
      hear the sounds of COPS arriving near the elevator area.

      Rush drags his last bag toward the silhouette of Mouse in a
      shower of hot glowing sparks... Then we hear a loud CLANG.
      Mouse shuts off the saw and kicks the grate open.
      Midway through the final stretch, Will stops and breathes
      HEAVY through the ventilation mask. Will puts his hands on
      his knees for one final breath before the last push.
                          RUSH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                Grier!
      Will looks up to see-- With sunlight shining through, the
      menacing dark silhouette of RUSH slowly approaches. Will
          LI

      slings the extra bag over at Rush’s feet.
                          WILL
            O

                    (out of breath)

                piece of shit.

                You a Linwood boy through and
                through. That much I know.
      A loud ROAR from the crowd rumbles above.    Rush looks up and
      closes his eyes to feel the crowd.
                                   AT

                          WILL

                Still haven’t caught on yet, huh?
      Will looks up with eyes big, now realizing too late.
                          RUSH (CONT'D)
                I thought I taught you good, Rook.
                    (points gun)
                But what’d I say? Deception,
                misdirection, surprise...
      BANG! Will’s shot in the chest. It’s a stunned reaction as
      another loud ROAR from the crowd erupts. BANG-BANG-BANG.
      Will fall’s back like a chopped tree onto his bag of money.
      Rush looks down at the limp body as the alarm light strobes.
                                                             101.

      Rush grabs the bag off Will’s back and as he does, the
      painter mask gets hooked by the bag strap and pulls it off...
      Rush stumbles back in shock when TOMMY’s bleach blond hair
      pops out from under the ski mask-- the sound drowns out...
      DISSOLVE TO:

209   AT THE SUV, with a bag over his back, Mouse drags another bag
                           SG

      across the grass as Carla watches on. He gets to the SUV and
      dumps each bag into the trunk.
210   Rush’s haunted face is frozen by the blind side deception.
      The sounds of COPS from the other end grows loader...
                                   AT

                           MOUSE (O.S.)
                Rush!   We gotta go!!
      Rush snaps out of it, looks toward the grate to see: MOUSE
      backpedaling with a bag on his back, dragging another bag.
                                            E

      Rush jogs to the grate, slings the last bag over his back.
      THEN he pulls TWO AR-15s from the wheelbarrow-- He slings
      one over his shoulder and carries the other out...

211   Rush now approaches the SUV, as Mouse finishes packing his
      last bag-- Rush lines the AR-15 up on Mouse’s head...
      That’s when Mouse looks in the rearview and notices Rush.
      Record scratch-- They both turn and see a COP CAR pull up in
      front of the SUV. Rush hands Mouse the other AR-15. They’ll
      have to talk about that later... If there is a later.
      From each side, COP 1 and COP 2 approach. Rush nods for
      Mouse to go left, he’ll go right... After some measured
      breathes-- They both pivot around the SUV and creep between
      parked cars, on the hunt--- COP 2 has an angle on RUSH. COP
      1 has an angle on MOUSE, BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG!
                                                                102.

      Rush takes cover as a series of PINGS and THUDS impact the
      car around him-- The SUV’s windshield and driver side window
      CRACK, taking multiple hits.
      On the other side, Mouse catches a bullet in the shoulder and
      falls back, wounded.
      RUSH pops over the hood-- Braap-Braap-Braaap! Cop 2’s tagged
      multiple times and he’s down.

      Wounded and filled with adrenaline, Mouse hides between a row
      of cars and circles around to flank Cop 1, who’s taking cover
      behind his car... WHOOSH, Mouse blurs between cars and
      appears behind him-- Braap-Braap, he puts Cop 1 down.

      Mouse stumbles toward the SUV as Rush opens the passenger
      door to find Carla, lifeless and bloody... His eye’s enrage
      with hell-fire-- Just then, a fleet of FEDs, TACTICAL
      OFFICERS, and Vidal arrive on the scene.
          LI

      Oblivious to the new danger, Mouse opens the driver side door
      and pulls Carla out... Mouse then gets in the driver seat
            O

      and yells for Rush to, “GET IN!”
      But Rush ducks down, as they receive countless rounds of
                     N

      fire... Brraaaap-Brraaap-Brraaaap-Brraaaap. Rush rises up
      through the smoky damage to see Mouse, covered in blood...
      Dead.
                         SG

      Rush explodes with anger, unleashing return fire at the
      officers. He sends them scurrying behind cars. He now runs
      to the driver side door, and pulls out Mouse’s lifeless body,
      then takes the driver seat position...
                                   AT

212   VROOM! Rush peels out of the parking spot and swerves toward
      the exit...

      Meanwhile, Vidal and a team of tactical officers stream
      through the parking lot to cut Rush off--
                                           E

      With tires squealing, Rush makes his way through the parking
      lot-- He sticks his AR-15 out the window and unloads fire at
      Police Officers attempting to cut him off, Brraaaap-Brraaap!!
214   STADIUM - ON THE FIELD, LA is in a hurry up offense.
                          TV ANNOUNCER 1 (O.S.)
                Here it is folks. The game’s on

      Will’s lined up, an intimidating cornerback stares at him,
      “GO!”-- Will sprints off the line, the cornerback manhandles
      him down the sideline. Crane drops back, searching for Will.
      Crane throws it but the cornerback has him every step of the
      way and tips the ball out of bounds.
215   Vidal makes it to the empty street and as she does-- RUSH’s
      SUV spills out. Vidal takes aim and empties her clip, she
      hits: the left tire and shatters the rear window.
      The SUV swerves, speeding through an intersection and BANG!
      The front of his SUV get’s T-BONED-- The SUV does a 180 spin
      and stops in the middle of the intersection, now facing
      VIDAL. The car horn blasts out, Brrrrrrrrrrr. The SUV is
      now a smoking, bullet-riddled heap.

      THROUGH the SUV’s windshield, you can’t see shit, just smoke.
      Rush raises his head and the car horn stops. He’s in bad
          LI

      shape and coughs up blood, almost laughing.

      With a mouth full of blood, Rush looks at the bag of cash
            O

      covered in broken glass, then looks through the windshield..
      Through the smoke we see VIDAL approaching, gun aimed.

216   STADIUM - ON THE FIELD, In the huddle, Crane calls a play and
      “BREAK”. As they break we’re IN HIGH SPEED:

      Will runs to his spot and looks ahead at the Cornerback...
      Will sees himself in the reflection of his visor.
                                   AT

                          RUSH (V.O.)

                eye the slant... Burn him deep.
                                           E

      Will points his foot slightly left and looks left.   The
      cornerback clocks it..

217   MIDDLE OF THE STREET, Standing now only 10 feet away, Vidal
      stares through the wispy smoke. She see’s Rush’s eyes
      staring right back. An officer approaches and tells her,
      “Vidal we just confirmed, he makes number four.”

218   INT RUSH CAR, Rush looks from Vidal to the seat next to him
      and sees the gun. He picks it up and reloads, CHUCHAK.

      In Rush’s car, we hear:

                          TV ANNOUNCER (PRE-LAP)

219   STADIUM - ON THE FIELD, Will looks down the line at Crane
      then back to the cornerback...

                Deception, misdirection,
                surprise...you gotta set him up.

      Crane snaps the ball on “GO!”-- Will goes hard left then
      right, he breaks the cornerback’s ankles and streaks down the
      sideline... WIDE OPEN... Crane sees it and throws a bomb.
      The football slowly spirals...

      In the corner of the end zone Will dives and CATCHES with
      both hands extended... He taps in both feet, TOUCHDOWN.

220   LISA’S MOM’S HOUSE, James jumps for joy and hugs his Mom.
