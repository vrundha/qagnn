                           Draft: April 8, 2020
                                                         1.


A BIRD ON A WIRE

A pigeon, to be precise. Perched on a telephone wire. Street
sounds mingle with the noise of children as we drift down to


EXT. YATES ACADEMY (RIVERDALE, NY) - DAY

Through a window we spy a hallway crowded with MIDDLE-SCHOOL
STUDENTS all wearing uniforms of navy blue polo shirts.


INT. YATES ACADEMY - CAFETERIA - DAY

Kids at lunch. Noisy with bursts of shouting and laughter.
Tables all crowded. All except one table toward the back...

It’s here we find those few kids who don’t fit in. Together
but alone, empty spaces between seats, books and phones for
company. JULIAN (12) eats his lunch and stares at his phone,
but can’t help feeling the stares from some of the kids at
other tables. A few WHISPER about him. Others SNICKER.

He struggles to ignore them, resumes staring at his phone --

                    CAROLINE (O.S.)
          Excuse me, hello? Hi?

He glances up to find someone addressing him: CAROLINE (13),
bookish and little over-eager, clutching a clipboard.

                     CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          Hi!   I’m Caroline.

                    JULIAN
              (guarded)
          Julian.

                    CAROLINE
          You’re new here, right?
              (off his wary nod)
          Well we have this club, SSJ -
          Students for Social Justice? -
          anyway, we’re trying to organize a
          big rally next week at Bryant Park
          in support of immigrant rights, and
          we’re looking for students to
          volunteer. It’s gonna be pretty
          amazing, there’s a ton of schools
          participating: Dalton, Beecher
          Prep, a bunch of public schools--

                    JULIAN
          Yeah, I don’t think so.
                                                            2.


                    CAROLINE
          Really? Are you sure? It’s a fun
          way to meet people -- I mean not
          that you need to, but, you know.
              (smiles)
          Honestly, you don’t have to do
          much, just show up really.

Julian shakes his head, returning his attention to his phone.

Caroline regards him a beat, then shrugs and moves on to the
next kid at the table. Julian tries to ignore the sound of
her sales pitch, returning his focus to --

HIS PHONE. We see he’s scrolling through Instagram: lots of
posts from the “Beecher Prep Science Fair!”

Julian’s expression tells us he knows these kids. They all
look to be having a great time, laughing and silly-posing for
the camera; a Wonder fan will recognize some of the names
tagging these photos: “SUMMER” “MAYA” “MILES” “XIMENA”...

Julian swallows hard, trying to ignore whatever emotions the
posts elicit as he continues to scroll... when he stops at
one image: a boy with a severe facial deformity mugging
goofily for the camera with two friends, their arms around
each other’s shoulders: “AUGGIE” “HENRY” “JACK WILL.”

Julian stares hard at the threesome; at Auggie in particular.
His expression darkens as he types: “Losers.”

He’s about to hit “Post” on his comment -- but hesitates.
Torn, he finally erases it, swallowing his irritation.


E./I. SCHOOL BUS (HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY) - LATE DAY

A yellow bus crawls in traffic en route back to Manhattan.
Noise of kids letting off steam after the school day.

Again Julian sits alone, staring hard out the window.


EXT. MANHATTAN’S UPPER WEST SIDE - APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK

Julian arrives home. The DOORMAN greets him cheerfully.
Julian manages to fake a smile in return. The Doorman asks
how Julian’s day was. Julian returns a brief thumbs up.


INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

Riding up alone, Julian angrily rubs away a forming tear.
                                                           3.


INT. ALBANS’ APARTMENT - EVENING

Julian enters, tosses his backpack.    The beautiful apartment
is extremely quiet.


INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

Julian opens the fridge. Tupperware neatly labeled “DINNER”
along with reheating instructions and “Home by 10pm. xo Mom”

Julian retrieves the tupperware, sets it down on the island --

-- when he freezes. His eyes dart, ears alert. The CREAK of
a floorboard. Then silence.

                    JULIAN
          Hello?

Nothing. Julian pads warily toward the kitchen door, when he
hears it again. The creak of the floorboard. And then a
faint sound, like someone whistling.

Julian catches his breath, inches a little closer to the door
to try to see into the living room...

           GRAND-MÈRE                         JULIAN (CONT'D)
  Boo!                             AAAAHH!

His GRAND-MÈRE pokes her head into the kitchen, giggling
naughtily. In her 90s, she’s remarkably spry even with a
cane, and impeccably coiffed and dressed.

                    JULIAN (CONT'D)
          Grand-mère, you scared the crap out
          of me!

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          Je suis désolé, mon cher!     I could
          not help myself!
              (holds out her arms)
          Viens ici! Allez, allez!

He joins her, gives her a hug.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (CONT'D)
          Ach! I fly all the way from Paris
          and that is the best you can do?

She squeezes him much tighter, kisses both his cheeks.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (CONT'D)
          Don’t tell me you did not know I
          was coming?
                                                         4.


                     JULIAN
          I did.   I just forgot it was today.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          I saw your parents a short while
          ago. They had to attend some fancy
          soirée with your father’s
          colleagues.

                    JULIAN
          Yeah, I know.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
              (smiles)
          So it is un table pour deus, oui?


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Julian and Grand-Mère having dinner together; it appears
Grand-Mère insisted upon using the family’s good China and
silverware despite a dinner of leftover lasagna and salad.

                    JULIAN
          Dad said they’re doing an exhibit
          of your paintings at the Whitney?

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          A “retrospective,” oui. It is a
          polite way of saying “you are old!”

Grand-Mère chuckles as she pours herself a healthy glass of
wine. She reaches for Julian’s glass to pour him some --

                    JULIAN
              (laughs)
          Grand-Mère, I’m a kid!

She grins at him with a little shrug, sets the bottle down.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          Alors. Tell me about you. How do
          you like this new school of yours?

                     JULIAN
              (hesitates)
          It’s okay.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          Just “okay?”

                    JULIAN
              (shrugs, reluctantly)
          Remember that kid I told you about,
                    (MORE)
                                                            5.

                    JULIAN (CONT'D)
          the one they said I was so mean to?
          Auggie Pullman?

Grand-Mère’s smile fades.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          I remember.

                    JULIAN
          Yeah, well - so does everyone.
          It’s bad enough he ruined my last
          school, now he’s ruining this one.
              (under his breath)
          The stupid freak.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          Were you?
              (off his confusion)
          Mean to this boy.

                    JULIAN
          I mean, I guess -- but I wasn’t the
          only one.

His words clearly pain her.

                     JULIAN (CONT'D)
          What?

She leans back.   Studies Julian a long, quiet moment.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          Your father has told you stories,
          I’m sure. About what happened to
          me, when I was a girl.

                     JULIAN
          Yeah.   I mean, some.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          I have been waiting for the right
          time to tell you everything myself.

Grand-Mère again takes a beat, debating, then gently exhales.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (CONT'D)
          I think maybe... that time is now.

Julian sits up as Grand-Mère takes a sip of wine.   Then:

                    GRAND-MÈRE (CONT'D)
          Do you know the name of the village
          in France where I lived?
                                                            6.


                    JULIAN
          Um, Auberdeen-something-something?

                    GRAND-MÈRE
              (amused)
          Aubervilliers-aux-Bois...


EXT. AUBERVILLIERS-AUX-BOIS - AERIAL - DAY

A quaint French village nestled in a picturesque mountain.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          It is a village in the Margeride
          mountains, surrounded by a very,
          very ancient forest called The
          Mernuit.


EXT. THE MERNUIT - DAY

Winter mist hovers over frozen ground, shrouding the trunks
of bare trees in all directions as far as we can see.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          The Mernuit was a dark and scary
          place. People would tell legends
          about the giant wolves that roamed
          the woods during the long winters.

TIME LAPSE: WINTER TRANSFORMS INTO GREEN, GLORIOUS SPRING

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          But in the spring, the leaves
          filled the trees, the birds
          returned and the forest came alive.
          And then in early May, the most
          wondrous thing would happen...

TIME LAPSE: THE FOREST FLOOR BURSTS INTO AN ALMOST SURREAL
SEA OF BRIGHT BLUE-VIOLET AS IT IS BLANKETED BY BLUEBELLS.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          The bluebells would come into
          bloom! It was magical.

On the horizon, the silhouettes of a young family of three.
The little girl runs ahead, straight toward us, wide-eyed and
rambunctious. This is SARA (aka Grand-Mère), age five.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          To see it was to feel like you had
          stepped into a fairy tale.
                                                         7.


As they near us, we meet Sara’s parents, MAX (gentle,
handsome) and ROSE (vibrant, maternal). Sara spins back to
her parents, both amused by her irrepressible excitement --


INT. ALBANS' APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Grand-Mère closes her eyes, remembering with a wistful smile.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          It is perhaps my most beloved
          memory of childhood: picnics with
          my parents among the fairy flowers.


EXT. THE MERNUIT - DAY

Back with the young family as we’d just left them:

                    SARA
          Can you make me a bird, Papa?

                    MAX
              (feigns exhaustion, grins)
          Again?

                    SARA
          But faster this time!

Max scoops her up as she giggles with anticipation.

                    MAX
          Now spread your wings wide...
          wider...

Sara’s arms are outstretched, beaming as she “flies” over the
radiant sea of bluebells rushing beneath her.

Max grins back at Rose, sharing the look young parents share
when they realize they are the luckiest people alive.


EXT. DIRT ROAD BACK TO TOWN - SUNSET

The family walking home from their picnic. Rose carries a
sleepy Sara, Sara’s chin resting on her mother’s shoulder.

                    SARA
          I want to be a bird when I grow up.

                    ROSE
          You do, do you?
                                                         8.


                    MAX
          I thought you were going to be a
          teacher, like your mother?

                    SARA
          A bird is better.

                    ROSE
              (smiles)
          I agree.

They walk a bit in contented quiet, then Rose begins to sing
softly in Sara’s ear, a poignant Yiddish melody:

                    ROSE (CONT'D)
          “Little bird, little bird,
          How high will you fly?
          As high as the sky,
          As the sky above...”

Max rubs Sara’s back, nestling closer as he joins in:

                    ROSE/ MAX
          “Little bird, little bird,
          How fast will you go?
          As fast as a crow,
          As fast as a dove.
          Little bird, little bird,
          How far will you see?
          As far as I wish,
          For now I am free.”


INT. BLUM FAMILY FLAT - NIGHT

Sara’s parents tuck her in bed, kiss the top of her sleeping
head. Pictures drawn in a child’s hand tacked to the walls.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          We lived in a beautiful flat, in a
          lovely part of town. My father was
          a doctor - a surgeon - and my
          mother taught mathematics.


INT. BLUM FAMILY FLAT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

SARA (AGE 8) in a pretty dress, playing piano. A menorah on
a mantle is all that tells us it’s a Jewish home.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          We were not rich, but we were
          certainly not poor.
                                                           9.


INT. AN UPSCALE BISTRO - NIGHT

SARA (AGE 11) dines with her parents. Rose laughs as Max
tries to convince Sara to try escargot.

                     GRAND-MÈRE
           I admit, I was a bit spoiled,
           although I did not see it that way.


EXT. AUBERVILLIERS-AUX-BOIS - CINEMA MERNUIT - DAY

SARA (AGE 14) running giddily with her friends, MARIANN and
SOPHIE, arriving under the marquee of the local cinema.

                     GRAND-MÈRE
           When life is as good as mine was,
           there is much you do not see.

They seem not to notice the Nazi banners and flags adorning
the occasional flagpoles in the background.

TITLE:   “August, 1942”

                                                     CUT TO:

B/W NEWSREEL FOOTAGE: A PARADE THROUGH THE STREETS OF PARIS

REGAL TRUMPETS herald a shot of German soldiers marching down
the Champs-Élysées. A title soars in: “FRANCE ACTUALITÈS!”

                     NEWSREEL NARRATOR (V.O.)
           It has been two years since Paris
           fell to Germany, and to mark the
           occasion, our beloved city was paid
           a visit by none other than Herr
           Hitler himself...

HITLER meets the saluting troops with steely satisfaction.
Beside him is ADOLF EICHMANN. PARISIANS line the streets;
some cheer, others look palpably anxious... WIDEN TO --

INT. CINEMA MERNUIT - THEATER - DAY

The newsreel continues playing to a packed house, but Sara
and her friends pay no attention to it, huddled together
WHISPERING and GIGGLING, lit by the glow of the movie screen.

                     MARIANN
           Ok, he just looked at you.

                     SARA
               (giggling)
           He did not! Will you ssh?!
                                                            10.


Sophie lets out a little shriek as she squeezes Sara’s arm,
nodding a few rows over to a TRIO OF 15 YEAR OLD BOYS. One
of them, VINCENT (tall, handsome), glances back at them.

                     SOPHIE
          Ah!   He just did it again!!

Vincent returns a grin, mutters something to his friends, who
CHUCKLE... as the newsreel drones on, PHILIPPE PETAIN (head
of the Vichy government) shaking hands with Hitler.

                                                 TIME CUT:

HARPO MARX BEING CHASED BY A GORILLA (FROM “AT THE CIRCUS”)

Sara and her friends now rapt, laughing along with the rest
of the audience. Cut to a high angle, as if someone is
watching above... follow the projector’s gauzy beam up into --


INT. PROJECTIONIST’S BOOTH

Quieter in here. We find the projectionist propped on a
stool by the machine, and discover he’s only a BOY himself.
He’s leaning forward, peering down at the crowd below,
particularly at the kids his own age. At Sara.

He seems intrigued by her.   When she laughs, a small smile
blooms on his own face.

The booth’s back door bangs open and the Boy turns to GEORGES
(50s, gruff) entering with TWO SERIOUS-LOOKING YOUNG MEN.
One has a rifle strapped to his shoulder.

                    GEORGES
          We’ll be in the cellar. Anyone
          asks for me, I went home sick with
          a cold. Okay?

The boy nods.   Georges steals a glance at the projector.

                    GEORGES (CONT'D)
          Sounds better now.

                    BOY
          I replaced the pressure roller.

Georges allows a hint of warmth, impressed. Then he exits.
A burst of LAUGHTER from the crowd. The Boy leans forward
again to steal another look at the kids below...

As he does, we now notice a pair of polio-era crutches
propped against the wall.
                                                            11.


EXT. AUBERVILLIERS-AUX-BOIS - MAIN THOROUGHFARE - MORNING

Dressed smartly for school, toting a book bag, Sara breezes
her scooter through town, greeting familiar neighbors and
shopkeepers with cheerful hello’s and good mornings.


EXT. A MOUNTAIN ROAD - MORNING

Sara pushes her scooter up a mountain road, eyes fixed on
what looks like a small castle on a hill. A sign reads
“ECOLE LAFAYETTE.”


EXT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - COURTYARD - DAY

Crowded with students milling before class.    Sara joins
Mariann and Sophie.

                    SARA
          Well?

Sara strikes a silly movie star pose, kicking up a heel.

                    SOPHIE
          Oh my God, are those them?!    I love
          them!

She’s referring to Sara’s new shoes.    Patent red leather.

                    MARIANN
          They look so expensive!

                    SARA
          Papa operated on the man who sells
          them, so he got a good--

A sudden burst of LAUGHTER behind them. They turn to see
some boys circled around someone: the Boy with the crutches.

                    MARIANN
              (more resigned than felt)
          Poor Tourteau...

One of the bullies has stolen the Boy’s crutches and hobbles
around on them, to the amusement of his cruel buddies. The
Bully sniffs the air, then hurls a crutch back at the Boy.

                    BULLY
          Uch, even his crutches reek!

                    SOPHIE
          They’re so mean. It’s not his
          fault his father gave him polio.
                                                           12.


                    MARIANN
          That’s not how he got it, dummy.
          It was just bad luck.

                     SOPHIE
          My mother says he got it because
          his father works in the sewers.
               (a tiny smirk)
          It’s definitely why he smells so
          bad.

Mariann SNICKERS guiltily.

                    SARA
          How would you know?   You never even
          talk to him.

                    SOPHIE
              (defensive)
          Neither do you.

Sara glances back at the Boy they call TOURTEAU struggling to
pick up his crutches and hobble away.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          She was right. I didn’t even know
          his name; we all just called him
          “Tourteau,” which means crab,
          because of how he walked.


INT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - CLASSROOM - DAY

CLAUDE, a sleepy-eyed boy, recites a Lamartine poem in a
nasally monotone at the front of the room.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          The truth is I did not think about
          him at all. I cared only about my
          clothes, my social life, and my
          passion secrète... my artwork.

We find Sara at her desk, stealthily drawing in a small
sketchbook. Her eyes flit to the window, and we realize
she’s drawing a pigeon resting on the sill.

                    MARIANN (O.S.)
          Psst!

Mariann tosses a folded note on Sara’s desk. Sara opens it
to find “SARA + VINCENT” circled in a heart. Sara blushes,
scribbles: “He barely knows I exist!” and tosses it back --

-- but it’s caught mid-air by MADEMOISELLE PETITJEAN (late
                                                          13.


20s, warm). Sara blanches, but Mlle Petitjean returns an
amused smile and pockets the note.

                    MLLE PETITJEAN
          Let’s try to pay attention, Sara.

                    SARA
          Yes, Mademoiselle Petitjean.

Mlle Petitjean is about to walk on, but can’t help notice the
sketch of the pigeon Sara was drawing. We see it too now,
and are struck by how remarkably well drawn it is.

Further embarrassed, Sara quickly shuts the sketchbook cover.
Her eyes meet Mlle Petitjean’s, who regards her curiously.

O.S. a BELL CHIMES.   The students instantly noisy.

                    MLLE PETITJEAN
          All right, see you all tomorrow.

The students move in a crush for the door. We spot Tourteau
among them, maneuvering on his crutches; he steals a brief
look at Sara, but she’s busy chatting with her friends.

                     MLLE PETITJEAN (CONT'D)
          Sara?   Could you stay a moment?

Mariann and Sophie give Sara an “uh oh” look, continue out
with the others, leaving Sara alone with Mlle Petitjean.

                    SARA
          I’m sorry about the note--

                    MLLE PETITJEAN
          Your drawing of the bird, may I see
          it again?

Sara hesitates, then hands her the sketchbook. Mlle
Petitjean regards her drawing of the pigeon, impressed.

She flips through the other pages.   Many more sketches, all
hinting at real talent.

                    MLLE PETITJEAN (CONT'D)
          Have you shown these to anyone?

                    SARA
          Just my parents.

Mlle Petitjean regards a few more, then closes the
sketchbook, hands it back, along with the “Vincent” note.
                                                          14.


                    MLLE PETITJEAN
          When I was your age, I loved to
          write. Poems, stories... But I
          kept them to myself. I thought if
          my friends knew - or God forbid,
          boys - they’d tease me. It wasn’t
          what “popular” girls do, you know?

Sara nods sheepishly, struck by how keenly she’s been read.

                    MLLE PETITJEAN (CONT'D)
          A gift is to be treasured, Sara.
          Never stop drawing, okay?

                    SARA
              (blushes)
          You sound like my father.

                    MLLE PETITJEAN
          I consider that quite the
          compliment.
              (smiles warmly)
          See you tomorrow.


EXT. AUBERVILLIERS-AUX-BOIS - STREET - DAY

Sara walking home from school, smiling to herself in the wake
of Mlle Petitjean’s praise. She stops into a BAKERY.


INT. BOULANGERIE BALLOU - LATE DAY

Sara knows the owner, MADAME BALLOU.

                    SARA
          Hi, Madame Ballou!    Hello, Pierre!

Sara bends to stroke the bakery’s resident cat, Pierre.

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          One pain au chocolat, please, extra
          gooey.

But Madame Ballou just stares at her, unsure.

Sara hesitates, confused; Madame Ballou seems torn, then
quickly turns and retrieves a freshly-baked pain au chocolat.

                       MADAME BALLOU
          Here.

                       SARA
          Thank you.
                                                         15.


Sara reaches into her purse to pay for it --

                    MADAME BALLOU
          Just take it and go.

Sara is even more confused, but shrugs it off, taking a big
bite of the pastry as she steps back outside --

-- and suddenly halts in her tracks. Pan with Sara’s look to
the store window, where we now notice the sign posted there:

                      JEWS NOT PERMITTED

Shaken, Sara peers past the sign and inside the bakery, where
Madame Ballou avoids her stare.


INT. BLUM FAMILY FLAT - NIGHT

Sara at the dinner table with her parents.   Tension abounds.

                     SARA
          What?   When??

                    ROSE
          Today. This morning.
              (a forced smile)
          Don’t worry, I’ll find another job.
          I was getting a little bored of the
          University anyway.

                    SARA
          But how can they do that? You’re
          the best math professor they have!

                    ROSE
          It’s complicated, Sara.

                    MAX
              (gravely)
          Not really.

                      ROSE
          Max.    Don’t.

                      SARA
          What?

Rose shoots Max a look, and now it dawns on Sara:

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          There was a sign in the window of
          the bakery today, it said No Jews -
                                                        16.


                    MAX
          There’s probably going to be more
          signs like that.

                    SARA
          But you said we were lucky? That
          we live in the unoccupied zone.
          The free zone.

                    MAX
          I’m afraid it’s becoming less free.

                    ROSE
          It’s like a bad storm, Sara, that’s
          all. We just have to weather it,
          and eventually it’ll pass.

Sara looks to her father; he doesn’t look as certain.

                    MAX
          Last month in Paris, the police
          arrested almost 13,000 Jews, many
          of them children. Rounded them up
          in the Velodrome and shipped them
          to Drancy, to a labor camp --

                    ROSE
          Max, enough -

                    SARA
          The French police?

                    MAX
          There is no France. Vichy takes
          its orders from Germany now.

                    ROSE
          You’re scaring her! Of course
          there’s a France. We’re French
          citizens with papers to prove it.

                    MAX
          I’m sorry but she needs to know
          what’s happening. In Lyon, Jews
          are being made to wear yellow stars
          like they do in the Occupied Zone.

                    ROSE
          Only foreign-born Jews, religious
          Jews -

                    MAX
          Rose, listen to yourself! You
          think these bastards care where we
                    (MORE)
                                                          17.

                    MAX (CONT'D)
          were born? Or whether we go to
          synagogue or not?! In their eyes,
          we aren’t French, we’re vermin, a
          disease to be wiped ou--

                       ROSE
          Enough!

Terrifying silence.    Rose stifling the urge to cry.

                       SARA
          Maman?

Rose shakes her head, forcing a smile again.

                    ROSE
          It’ll be okay, Sara. This is our
          country and it always will be.
              (to Max, insistent)
          Tell her. Tell her it’s going to
          be okay.

Max stares at his wife a hesitant beat, then quietly nods.

                    MAX
          It’s going to be okay.

                                                     CUT TO:

A SIGN AFFIXED TO A PARK’S IRON GATE: “FORBIDDEN TO JEWS.”

Title: “March, 1943”


EXT. AUBERVILLIERS-AUX-BOIS - PUBLIC GARDENS - DAY

Through the gate slats we can make out a group of YOUNG
CHILDREN watching a MARIONETTE SHOW. One of the puppets is
dressed as a grotesque rabbi, with a huge nose and evil brow,
chased and beaten by a bully stick as the children laugh.

REVERSE ON SARA (it was her POV), watching with a knot in her
stomach. She backs away from the gate, quickly hurries on.


EXT. AUBERVILLIERS-AUX-BOIS - STREETS - DAY

That sign in the window of Boulangerie Ballou still hangs...
as do similar signs in at least a dozen more windows now, all
variations of “NO JEWS ALLOWED” “JEWS NOT WELCOME” etc.

Sara clutches her book sack tight, now avoiding eye contact
with her fellow villagers as she hurries through town.
                                                           18.


EXT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - ENTRANCE - DAY

A sense of relief in Sara’s eyes as she arrives at this
seeming haven. She passes under the archway to find the
school’s gentle headmaster PASTOR LUC crossing her path.

                    PASTOR LUC
          Morning, Miss Blum!

                    SARA
          Good morning, Pastor Luc.

As Sara continues past, we linger with Pastor Luc as he
watches after her, his smile fading to a look of sympathy.


EXT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - THE COURTYARD

Crowded as usual before class. Spotting Mariann and Sophie
excitedly waving her over, Sara brightens and joins them.

                    SOPHIE
          What’re you doing after school?

                    MARIANN
          You have to come ice-skating with
          us!

                    SOPHIE
          We think Vincent’s gonna be there.

                    SARA
          Okay sure, I --

Sara abruptly trails off, realizing something... and a moment
later, the same realization occurs to Mariann as well:

                    MARIANN
          Sara, I’m so sorry.    I forgot.

                    SOPHIE
          Forgot what?

Mariann shoots Sophie a hard “think about it” look.

                   SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          Ohhh. I’m so sick of these stupid
          rules.

                    MARIANN
          It’s just until the war’s over.

                    SARA
          Right.
                                                          19.


INT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - CLASSROOM - DAY

Mlle Petitjean is delivering a lesson, but Sara’s mind is
elsewhere, visibly troubled. Mlle Petitjean notices Sara’s
distraction, perhaps intuiting its cause -- when the bell’s
CHIMES signal dismissal. Sara rises in a fog.

Barely listening to the chatter from Mariann and Sophie
flanking her, Sara fakes an attentive smile as the trio exit.


INT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - CORRIDOR - DAY

The girls heading for their next class when --

                     BOY’S VOICE (O.S.)
          Sara?   Um, excuse me? Sara?

Sara glances back, surprised to find Tourteau making his way
toward them on his crutches.

                    SOPHIE
              (whispers)
          Oh, my God, what is he doing?

                    MARIANN
          Is he coming over here?

Sara ignores them, uneasy but trying to appear polite.

                    TOURTEAU
          I saw this under your desk. I
          figured you must have dropped it.

She’s confused to see he’s holding out her sketchbook.
Feeling exposed, she takes it quickly.

                     SARA
          Thanks.

Tourteau bows his head slightly, proffers a slight smile.

                    TOURTEAU
          You’re welcome.

Sara manages an awkward half-smile back. He turns and goes.
The moment his back is turned, Sophie pinches her nose and
fake gags. Mariann feigns disapproval but grins nonetheless.

                    MARIANN
          Somebody has a crush...

Sara shakes her head, grinning a little too in spite of
herself.
                                                          20.


                    VINCENT (O.S.)
          Friend of yours?

Sara spins, stunned to find Vincent and his buddy (JEROME)
approaching. Sophie subtly squeezes Sara’s forearm.

                    SARA
          What? Oh - no, he just... I left
          something in class.

                    VINCENT
          What was it?

                    SARA
          Nothing, just...

She glances down at her sketchbook. Vincent appears curious,
smiles warmly at Sara, disarming her.

                    VINCENT
          May I?

Sara hesitates, but he reaches out with an “it’s okay” smile.

                    JEROME
          Don’t, man! Tourteau touched it
          with his crab claws.

                    MARIANN
              (giggles)
          Jerome, you’re terrible!

Vincent just ignores him, flashing another gentle smile at
Sara as she hands him the sketchbook, Sophie beaming for her.

Her heart aflutter, Sara watches as Vincent opens her
sketchbook and carefully flips through the pages.

                    VINCENT
          Wow... You drew all of these?

                    SARA
          Just when I’m bored.   It’s mostly
          stupid stuff.

                    VINCENT
          You shouldn’t say that.

He then pauses on a sketch: it’s a portrait of Vincent.   Sara
instantly blanches - she’d forgotten it was in there!
Vincent glances up, looking surprised and flattered.

                    VINCENT (CONT'D)
          Is this me?
                                                           21.


                    SARA
              (at a loss)
          I, um --

                       VINCENT
          I like it.

She glances up at his handsome, smiling face and blushes.

                     VINCENT (CONT'D)
          You shouldn’t be shy about your
          talent. These are really good...
              (smile becomes a smirk)
          For a Jew.

Sara is momentarily shell-shocked, as if unable to fathom the
jarring disconnect... when Jerome laughs cruelly. Vincent
laughs too, then tosses the sketchbook at her feet.

Sophie titters uncomfortably, Mariann looks ashamed as the
boys walk off, cracking jokes that spur more laughter.
Trembling a little, Sara bends and picks up her sketchbook.

                       MARIANN
          Sara -

But Sara quickly hurries off, fighting back tears...

                    RADIO PUNDIT (PRE-LAP)
          For too long have we allowed these
          Israelites to debase our nation!


EXT. AUBERVILLIERS-AUX-BOIS - MAIN THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT

A SQUAD OF UNIFORMED MILICE OFFICERS stop a YOUNG COUPLE on
the sidewalk, bluntly demanding to see their papers. The
frightened couple comply. On the man’s papers we see they’re
stamped “JEWISH.” The Officers exchange a cryptic look.

                    RADIO PUNDIT (PRE-LAP)
          France must be purged of every Jew,
          every communist, every Gaullist who
          would seek to corrupt us!


INT. BLUM FAMILY FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Rose is doing dinner dishes as she listens to the radio:

                    RADIO PUNDIT (V.O.)
          It’s time we rebuild our country,
          so that we too may know the pride
          they feel in Berlin, in Munich, in--
                                                           22.


The radio is abruptly snapped off by Max, who’s just entered.
He hands Rose a weathered-looking envelope.

                    MAX
          It’s from Marseilles.    Aaron and
          Lucie were arrested.

                     ROSE
          What?   But that’s the free zone -

                    MAX
          There was a round-up. Apparently
          they were taken to a camp up north
          near Compiegne, then relocated
          twice more, no one knows where.

Rose sets the letter down, wipes a tear with a quivering
hand. Returns to the glass she was washing.

                    MAX (CONT'D)
          Petain is putting Darnand in charge
          of the national police. A fascist
          in league with Hitler’s SS, in
          charge of the police--

The glass slips from Rose’s hand and SHATTERS in the sink.
Rose starts to silently cry. Max exhales.

                    MAX (CONT'D)
          It’s time, Rose.


INTERCUT: INT. SARA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Sara lying on her bed, looks like she’s been crying for
hours. She stares up at the ceiling, listening:

                    MAX (O.S.)
          We need to get out while we can,
          like Rabbi Bernstein and his wife -

                    ROSE (O.S.)
          So what, we just abandon our house,
          our furniture, everything we own?
          Everything we’ve worked for?


BACK TO: ROSE AND MAX IN THE KITCHEN

                    MAX
          Our furniture?   Rose --
                                                          23.


                    ROSE
          I know.
              (a painful nod, torn)
          I know.

Max takes her hands in his, their love profound and palpable.

                    ROSE (CONT'D)
          I just want to give it a little
          more time. Get our things in
          order, say our goodbyes.

                    MAX
          There can be no goodbyes, you know
          that. No one must know.


INT. BLUM FAMILY FLAT - SARA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A faint KNOCK on the door. Max pokes his head in, finds Sara
as we left her. He smiles gently at her. She stays quiet.

Max notices her sketchbook on the desk. Picks it up, flips
through. Happens on the drawing she’d made of the pigeon.

                    MAX
          This one’s beautiful, Sara. It
          reminds me of that song we used to
          sing when you were little, you
          remember?
              (sits down; sings softly)
          “Little bird, little bird,
          How high will you fly?
          As high as the sky,
          As the sky above.
          Little bird, little bird,
          How fast will you--”

                    SARA
          I don’t want to leave.

Max stares back at her, realizing she overheard it all.

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          This is my home.

                    MAX
          And it always will be. But it’s
          time to say goodbye, at least for
          now.

Sara shuts her eyes, a hitch in her voice:
                                                          24.


                    SARA
          Why do people hate us so much?

Max is moved by the pain and fear he hears in her.

                    MAX
          Not all people. You need to
          remember that.

                    SARA
          But some do.

                    MAX
          Some, yes. But what I think...
          what I believe, is that all people
          have a light inside of them. It’s
          what lets them see into other
          people’s hearts...

A faint noise behind him. Max turns to find Rose standing in
the open doorway, smiling sadly at Sara.

                    MAX (CONT'D)
          But in some people, for whatever
          reason, that light’s gone out.
          They hate us because they can not
          see us.

Rose enters the room, joins Max beside Sara on her bed.

                    ROSE
          We’re sorry, Sara. We know this is
          going to be very hard for you.

                    SARA
          How soon do we need to leave?

                     MAX
          Soon.   By next week, the latest.

                     ROSE
          It won’t be forever.

                    SARA
          You promise?

Rose glances at Max.   He meets Sara’s worried gaze, assuring:

                    MAX
          We promise.

They rise, kiss her goodnight -- when Max notices Sara’s red
shoes laid out beside tomorrow’s outfit. A thought, then:
                                                          25.


                    MAX (CONT'D)
          Now I need a promise from you.
          I want you to keep wearing your
          winter boots to school.

                    SARA
          What? But it’s almost April!      I’ll
          look ridiculous!

                    MAX
          Please, little bird.

                       SARA
          But why?

                    MAX
          I just want you to, okay?

                    SARA
              (huffs)
          Fine.

                       MAX
          Promise?

                       SARA
          Yes.

                       MAX
          Thank you.

                    ROSE
          Good night, Sara.   We love you.

                    SARA
              (quietly)
          I love you too.


EXT. BLUM FAMILY FLAT/ STREET - MORNING

Sara exits her building, carrying her book sack, her clumsy
brown winter boots doing her outfit no favors. She continues
down the block, around the corner --

-- then slows to a stop, brow furrowed as if debating
something. She finally sighs, quickly takes her bag from her
shoulder... and removes her patent leather red shoes.


EXT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - ENTRANCE - MORNING

Sara arrives at school in her red shoes, continues into
                                                         26.


THE COURTYARD

Searching for Mariann and Sophie -- she spots Vincent,
Jerome, and their gang laughing rowdily at something. Sara
quickly walks the other way before they can notice her.


INT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - CLASSROOM - DAY

Sara is discreetly doodling in her sketchbook as Mlle
Petitjean is explaining the Pythagorean Theorem.

                    MLLE PETITJEAN (O.S.)
          So then A-squared plus B-squared--

She’s interrupted by the door opening. Sara glances up to
find Pastor Luc in the door frame, looking anxious.

                    PASTOR LUC
          Mlle Petitjean, may I have a word?

                       MLLE PETITJEAN
          Of course.

They step aside, speaking in low tones.   The kids exchange
curious glances.

Pastor Luc finally steps out as Mlle Petitjean turns to them:

                    MLLE PETITJEAN (CONT'D)
          Children, I have to leave for a few
          minutes. I want you all to behave
          until I’m back, okay? Sara, Ruth,
          I need you to come with me.
          Quickly please. Bring your coats.

                    SARA
              (thrown)
          What? Why?

                    MLLE PETITJEAN
          I’ll explain everything outside.
          The rest of you stay in your seats.

Sara and RUTH rise and follow Mlle Petitjean out to --


INT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - HALLWAY - DAY

Mlle Petitjean walking quickly, speaking urgently:

                    MLLE PETITJEAN
          There’s been a roundup of the Jews
          in Aubervilliers-aux-Bois. We
                    (MORE)
                                                           27.

                       MLLE PETITJEAN (CONT'D)
             believe German officers are on
             their way here now.

                       SARA
                 (scared)
             Here?

                       MLLE PETITJEAN
             A maquisard is going to take you
             and the other Jewish children to
             hide in the woods.
                 (worried)
             Sara, where’s your coat?

                       SARA
                 (on the verge of tears)
             I - I left it in the art room.

Mlle Petitjean takes off her scarf, wraps it around Sara

                          MLLE PETITJEAN
             Take this.

                       SARA
             I’m scared.

                          RUTH
             Me too.

                       MLLE PETITJEAN
             I know you are, but it’s going to
             be all right.


EXT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - DAY

Snow flurries are falling as Mlle Petitjean hurries Sara and
Ruth across the courtyard, ducking under --

AN ARCHWAY

-- where Pastor Luc is waiting with a young MAQUISARD
(resistance fighter) and a dozen other CHILDREN (6 - 15).

                       PASTOR LUC
             Children, this is Antoine. He will
             keep you safe, but you must all do
             exactly as he says, understand?

The frightened children all nod. Sara is already shivering.
In the distance, a faint sound of ENGINES approaching.
                                                          28.


                    ANTOINE
          I need you all to stay very quiet
          and run very fast. Can you do that?

Some mutter “yes” and “okay,” most are mute with fear.    Sara
looks around - most of the kids are wearing boots.

                      ANTOINE (CONT'D)
          Ready?...    Now!

They take off sprinting in a pack behind the Maquisard,
hurrying out of the school grounds and toward

THE MOUNTAINOUS WOODS

Trees dotting the perimeter.

TIGHT ON SARA

Running as hard as she can, but already falling behind as her
red shoes slip and stick in the snow. Behind her she hears
engines roaring to a halt, then loud GERMAN VOICES.

She steals a look back: two MILITARY TRUCKS are idling in the
courtyard, GERMAN SOLDIERS barking orders at the faculty...


EXT. COURTYARD (CONTINUOUS)

Pastor Luc reviewing a list of names he’s been handed by a
stern-faced GERMAN COMMANDER. A pair of uniformed FRENCH
GENDARMES stand nearby, equally intimidating.

                    PASTOR LUC
          I’m sorry, none of these children
          came to school today. They must
          have been tipped off beforehand --

He’s interrupted by the sound of a CLASSROOM WINDOW abruptly
opening above. Vincent leans out, shouts down to the Germans:

                    VINCENT
          They ran to the woods!

Pastor Luc blanches as soldiers quickly react, the Commander
swiftly ordering a a cadre to search the woods --


EXT. WOODS (OUTSKIRTS) - CONTINUOUS

Hearing the distant sound of soldiers nearing, Sara runs even
harder -- when her shoe slips and she goes down. She starts
to pick herself up, but at ground level she’s now aware of
the many footprints the Jewish children left in their wake.
                                                           29.


She peers back toward the sounds of those German voices
growing louder... closer...

Sara scrambles to her feet, eyes darting -- she can just make
out the last of the group up ahead. Breathless, her gaze
lands on a small woodshed some 30 feet away...

CUT TO THE FOUR GERMAN OFFICERS

All steel helmets and rifles as they race up the snowy slope,
following the foot tracks, shouting to each other in German.

The soldiers fan out as they enter the woods.   One runs right
past the little woodshed --

INSIDE THE WOODSHED

We find Sara crouched in terror, shivering violently and
holding her breath --

-- when a distant GUNSHOT rings out.   All heads turn --


INT. CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kids’ faces pressed to the window panes, watching, stunned...

...as the small group of escapees emerge from the surrounding
woods, flanked by the four rifle-wielding Nazi soldiers.

The kids exchange terrified glances, scared speechless.


INT. SMALL WOODSHED/ EXT. WOODS (OUTSKIRTS) - CONTINUOUS

Sara still hiding, watching in horror as the other German
soldiers roll up in the two trucks to meet the group in the
open field between the woods and the school.

Many of the children are crying as Antoine is yanked forward
by a TALL SOLDIER, then thrust to his knees in the snow.

One of the Soldiers says something in German that makes the
Tall Soldier snicker; he then swings his rifle around and
presses it to the back of Antoine’s head.

                    ANTOINE
          Vive l’humanité!!

BANG! The gunshot kills the young man instantly, his body
slumping into the snow as the children SCREAM and SHRIEK.
                                                        30.


ON SARA, HIDING

Eyes wide in horror, clutching her mouth to keep from
screaming. And then she sees TWO FIGURES hurrying across the
field toward the children: Pastor Luc and Mlle Petitjean...

The Nazi Soldiers are meanwhile herding the panicked children
toward the truck beds --

                    GERMAN COMMANDER
          It’s okay, we’re taking you to your
          parents. Everybody in.

                     PASTOR LUC (O.S.)
          Wait!   Wait!

The Commander spins on Pastor Luc, draws his pistol.

                     PASTOR LUC (CONT'D)
          For the love of God, let them go.
          I beg you.

                     GERMAN COMMANDER
          Lying scum. I should shoot you
          right now.

                    MLLE PETITJEAN
          Don’t! Please -- don’t do this.
          They’re only children.

                    GERMAN COMMANDER
          They’re Jews. We have our orders.

Beside the Commander, a FRENCH GENDARME is reviewing the list
of names. He glances up at the children being hoisted into
the truck, then frowns at his list. Math not adding up...

TIGHTER ON SARA IN THE WOODSHED

Watching this. Realizing. Her eyes dart, sees her only
chance at escape is a desperate dash down a far slope, toward
the back side of the school, where the bell tower hovers.

                    GERMAN COMMANDER (CONT'D)
          If you have any brains, you’ll go
          back inside and mind your own
          business.

                    MLLE PETITJEAN
          These children are our business.

Pastor Luc takes her arm, scared for her --
                                                        31.


                     MLLE PETITJEAN (CONT'D)
          No!

She tugs her arm free of his grasp, marches to the truck.

                     MLLE PETITJEAN (CONT'D)
          These are my students. I’m staying
          with them.

                     PASTOR LUC
          Marie...

But she ignores him, pushing past the Tall Soldier and
climbing into the truck bed, to the surprise of the officers.

All except the Soldier who was reviewing his list. He says
something to his Commander, who then spins on Pastor Luc:

                    COMMANDER
          There are 14 names on our list, but
          only 13 children accounted for.

TIGHTER ON SARA

Knows it’s now or never. Staying low, she suddenly ducks out
of the shed and takes off in a crouch down the far slope --

-- seconds before she would have been found by the Soldiers,
who now start to approach the little shed. The Commander
orders some underlings back to the woods to keep searching...

IN THE TRUCK

Mlle Petitjean wraps her arms around the smallest children,
all crying and trembling despite her comforting whispers.


EXT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - BASE OF THE BELL TOWER - DAY

Sara comes stumbling into view, racing to a door at the base
of the tower. She steals a last look back, then ducks in.


INT. BELL TOWER - STAIRWELL - DAY

Sara climbs the five stories of steps in a mad sprint,
gasping for breath, her red shoes slipping on the stone...


INT. BELL TOWER - TOP - DAY

Sara enters, shuts the door behind her. She finally allows
herself a moment to suck in some air, her gaze taking in the
                                                          32.


huge old bell surrounded by four exposed walls, snow gusting
in through the openings. She goes to one, peers out to see --

BELOW: THE GROUNDS AND THE WOODS BEYOND. The children and
Mlle Petitjean as we left them, waiting in the truck in the
falling snow as the Officers search the woods for Sara.

Stricken, tears well in Sara’s eyes as her frozen fingers
absently grip Mlle Petitjean’s scarf.

TIGHTER ON SARA’S POV OF MLLE PETITJEAN, comforting the
children in the truck as best she can.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          I only found out what happened to
          them years later...


INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Students’ faces still pressed to the windows, staring at
their beloved teacher refusing to show her captors any fear.


EXT. RURAL COUNTRYSIDE (OCCUPIED FRANCE) - DAY

NAZI OFFICERS in warm coats and combat boots march a group of
underdressed CHILDREN AND ADULTS across harsh, snowy terrain.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          The camp they were taken to was too
          crowded. So the Germans ordered
          them to march to Pithiviers.

The group starts to splinter, the younger ones unable to keep
up as a blizzard rages harder. Mlle Petitjean looks gaunt,
frozen, but determined to stay with her youngest students.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          Some of the younger children fell
          behind. But Mlle Petitjean refused
          to leave them.

Their small figures become smaller and smaller in the harsh
white landscape as we drift further and further away...

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          No one knows what happened to them.
          Perhaps they lost their way when
          night fell. Or perhaps the Nazis
          saw to it there were no stragglers.

Mlle Petitjean and the children finally vanish altogether.
                                                           33.


                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          Either way, they never arrived in
          Pithiviers. No one ever saw Mlle
          Petitjean again.


INT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - BELL TOWER - DAY

Sara as we’d left her, staring out in terror at Mlle
Petitjean and the children huddled in the idling truck bed --

-- when she freezes, suddenly hearing something: the thump of
FOOTSTEPS ascending the staircase. Terrified, Sara quickly
looks around: there’s only one way out of the tower, and
that’s by the same staircase. She’s trapped.

She hurries back to the window, peers down. Far too high to
attempt a jump. And yet as those ominous footsteps get
closer and closer, she’s deciding to do just that...

She grips the edge of the stones, peering down once more at
the vertiginous five-story plummet...

She starts to climb onto the icy ledge, glancing over her
shoulder at the door. She hears the footsteps arriving on
the other side, a sound of the door being pushed open... She
peers back out at the drop, just about to jump -- when --

                    BOY’S VOICE
          Sara!

Stunned, she glances back to find the figure in the doorframe
is not a Nazi, but... Tourteau?? Sara stares back in shock --

                     TOURTEAU
          I saw you running this way. The
          soldiers are still searching for
          you. You need to come with me,
          right now.

                    SARA
          But --

                    TOURTEAU
          It’s okay - I know a way out.


INT. BELL TOWER - STAIRCASE - DAY

Tourteau maneuvers back down the stone steps with his
crutches, Sara right behind him. O.S. they can hear the
shouts of Soldiers and Gendarmes in the school building.

They arrive back at the base of the tower.    Tourteau nudges
                                                           34.


open an old door with his crutch, revealing A DANK HALLWAY.

                       TOURTEAU
          Follow me.


INT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - SUBTERRANEAN LEVEL - DAY

Tourteau leads Sara through a dark, cavernous space.    Her
voice echoes off the moist walls:

                    SARA
          Where are we?

                    TOURTEAU
          We need to keep moving.     Down these
          stairs.

                    SARA
          What stairs?

Sure enough, they’ve reached another staircase - this one
descending to darker depths. No sooner does Sara start to
follow Tourteau down than she’s met by a powerful stench.

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          W-where are we?

                    TOURTEAU
          Sorry, it’s the safest way.

Confused, Sara’s about to reply -- when she hears LAPPING
WATER. A few more steps, and she sees that the floor below
sits beneath two feet of putrid liquid.

                     TOURTEAU (CONT'D)
          My father showed me this once.
          He’s worked in these sewers for
          years. It’s okay, it’s only about
          as deep as your knees.
              (beat)
          I think.

He steps into the murk first.     She hesitates, then follows.


INT. SEWER ROUTE - MOMENTS LATER

Tourteau leading the way, sloshing forward on his crutches.

                    TOURTEAU
          There should be a tunnel up there
          that leads to the storm drains. We
          can take that out to Dannevilliers.
                                                           35.


Glancing back, he sees how hard Sara is shivering.   He stops,
quickly removes his coat.

                     TOURTEAU (CONT'D)
          Here.

                    SARA
          I’m f-f-fine...

                    TOURTEAU
          You’re freezing, and it’s another
          12 kilometers to Dannevilliers.

He hands her his coat, and she puts it on.

                    SARA
          What’s in Dannevilliers?

                     TOURTEAU
          My home.


EXT. DANNEVILLIERS OUTSKIRTS - DUSK

Rural and rugged. Barren trees loom ominously in twilight...
as Tourteau and Sara emerge from the subterranean steps.


EXT. DANNEVILLIERS - WOODS - DUSK

Tourteau leads Sara along the rocky banks of a wooded brook.

                    TOURTEAU
          Careful, it’s slippery.

Sara’s fancy red shoes look wrecked now, their slippery soles
sliding from stone to stone. Tourteau’s crutches navigate
the wet rocks deftly; he’s clearly cold but not letting on.

                    TOURTEAU (CONT'D)
          Not much farther now, but we should
          stay off the main roads. You okay?

Sara manages to nod, fighting the urge to cry.


EXT. DANNEVILLIERS - COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

A few small houses line a street in a poor neighborhood.

                    SARA
          I’ve never been out this way.
          Dannevilliers, I mean.
                                                           36.


                    TOURTEAU
          Not quite as nice as Aubervilliers.

Sara glances back at him, surprised he knows where she lives.

                    TOURTEAU (CONT'D)
          I have a job at the Cinema Mernuit,
          running the projector on Saturdays.
          I’ve seen you there.

                    SARA
          Oh.

His friendly smile falters awkwardly as he realizes that
sounded a little stalker-ish --

-- when the headlamp of a loud motorcycle comes speeding
toward them. Tourteau quickly hurries Sara alongside the
nearest house, the pair crouching low as the motorcycle ROARS
past. They wait until the street is dark and still again.

                    TOURTEAU
          See that house, end of the street?
              (off her nod)
          That’s ours. Only I’m thinking it
          might not be safe for you to stay
          there. There’s a nosy old couple
          who live right above us. My father
          thinks they’re Nazi informants.

He looks back at her, trying to sound assuring.

                    TOURTEAU (CONT'D)
          There’s an old barn just across the
          field. You’ll be safer there.

He leans out from where they’re concealed, checks both ways
to make sure no one is watching.

                    TOURTEAU (CONT'D)
          Ready?

Sara nods, and follows him across the street... toward a
dilapidated stone barn just visible across a dark field.


INT. BARN - NIGHT

A wooden door creaks open and Tourteau leads Sara inside.
She peers around at the equally decrepit interior, strafed by
shadows and moonglow. Cobwebs cling to rusty tools and an
old car. A mouse scurries over Sara’s foot; she GASPS!

Alarmed, Tourteau spins to her --
                                                        37.


                     SARA
          Sorry.   Mouse.

Tourteau nods, apologetic:

                    TOURTEAU
          If it was safe to stay at my house -

                    SARA
          I’m fine, really. This is... nice.
              (ears suddenly perk up)
          What was that?
              (off his look)
          That. That sound.

                    TOURTEAU
          Oh, um - that would be the bats.
          They nest in the rafters sometimes.
          They’re harmless though, I swear.

Sara exhales anxiously, a knot tightening in her gut.

                    TOURTEAU (CONT'D)
          There’s the hayloft. I was thinking
          that’s where you could hide.
              (realizing)
          ...Only there’s no ladder. Right.
              (quickly)
          Not a problem, you can just...

He gets down on all fours, making a step stool of his back.

                    TOURTEAU (CONT'D)
          It’s fine, really.
              (grins)
          I’m stronger than I look.

Sara gingerly approaches, steps up on his back and pulls
herself up into the loft. Tourteau stands, peers up at her.

                    TOURTEAU (CONT'D)
          We’ll stack some hay bales along
          the edge and you’ll be hidden
          completely.
              (turns to go)
          All right, I’ll be right back.

                    SARA
          Wait you’re leaving??

                    TOURTEAU
          Just to tell my parents what’s
          going on. I’ll come back with some
          food and blankets.
                                                             38.


                       SARA
          Okay.
              (then)
          Tourteau?

He peers back up at Sara in the hayloft, musters a smile.

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          I just want to, you know, thank
          you. If you hadn’t...

She trails off, emotional.      It’s all still sinking in.

                       TOURTEAU
          It’s okay.     You’re safe now.

He retrieves his crutches -- then stops, glances back at her:

                    TOURTEAU (CONT'D)
          There is one thing though...

                       SARA
          Yes?

                    TOURTEAU
          Maybe call me by my real name,
          instead of Tourteau?

                    SARA
          Oh -- of course. I just, um --
          well I know your last name is
          Beaumier because they always sit us
          next to each other, but I, um...

                    TOURTEAU
              (a gentle smile)
          It’s Julien.

                      SARA
          Sorry.    Thank you... Julien.

Julien doffs his cap with a little bow, then heads off...


INT. ALBANS’ APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Julian stares back at Grand-Mère, surprised.

                       JULIAN
          Julien?
                                                        39.


                    GRAND-MÈRE
              (nods, smiles)
          Your father knew how special that
          name was to me.

Her smile fades slightly, tinged by sadness.

                    JULIAN
          So what happened next?

For a moment, she seems lost in her memory of that night.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          Next I met his parents, Vivienne
          and Jean-Paul...


INT. BARN - NIGHT

Sara hugs a wool blanket tight around her as VIVIENNE hands
Sara a bowl of soup and JEAN-PAUL sweeps out cobwebs.

                    VIVIENNE
          We’re going to do everything we can
          to find your parents, we promise.
          Until then you’ll stay here with
          us.

Vivienne meets Sara’s scared look with an assuring smile.

                    JEAN-PAUL
          It’s not the Ritz, but we can spiff
          it up a little, can’t we Julien?

                     SARA
              (almost a whisper)
          Thank you.

                    VIVIENNE
          Try to eat something while I fix a
          bed, all right?

Vivienne takes more blankets and climbs up to the hayloft
using a big barrel Jean-Paul has positioned underneath it.

Sara looks at the bread and cheese Vivienne set out for her --

FLASH ON: MAX AND ROSE AND SARA AT DINNER, EATING AND
LAUGHING TOGETHER IN THE WARM LIGHT OF THEIR HOME.

FLASH ON: MAX CARRYING FIVE-YEAR-OLD SARA LIKE A “BIRD” OVER
THE BLUEBELLS, SARA GLANCING BACK AT ROSE WAVING TO HER.
                                                           40.


FLASH ON: ROSE AND MAX SITTING ON THE EDGE OF SARA’S BED,
ASSURING HER THEY’LL RETURN TO THEIR HOME AFTER THE WAR --

TIGHT ON SARA’S FACE

AS SHE BOLTS AWAKE, disoriented, then realizes where she is --


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

--in blankets atop a pile of hay. Sara can’t hold it in any
longer; tears start to well in her eyes. Desperately scared.

                    SARA
              (barely a whisper)
          Maman... Papa... where are you?

A HOWLING WIND is the only reply, rattling the rafters.    Sara
hugs herself, peering around the darkness.

She wipes at her tears as she positions herself against a
window and stares out at the dark sky...

...when, just outside the window, a WHITE BIRD perches on a
branch. It holds her gaze for a fraction of an instant, then
flies away. Sara watches it go, vanishing into the night.


EXT. NIGHT SKY - NIGHT

The white bird soars through the dark sky... flying over

A TRAIN STATION (DRANCY)

Dreary and ominous, dark platforms overcrowded with JEWISH
PRISONERS - WOMEN, MEN, CHILDREN - being roughly ordered onto
trains by grim-faced FRENCH AND GERMAN SOLDIERS.

We recognizes Rose Blum within the crush of people boarding
the train, an unspeakable sorrow in her eyes.

PANNING UP to the TRAIN’S WINDOW, we find Rose peering out,
as if searching for Sara.

In a moment, the train wheels begin to grind ominously as it
rolls out of the station, Rose receding from view...


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - EARLY MORNING

CLOSE ON SARA sleeping fitfully, her expression suggesting
she’s in the grip of a haunting dream.
                                                        41.


A WOMAN’S HAND enters frame, gently touches her shoulder.
Sara immediately GRABS for it, squeezing tight as she stirs,
blinking up in the hopes that this was all just a bad dream --

                       SARA
          Maman?

-- only to find Vivienne crouched beside her. Sara quickly
lets her hand go, embarrassed. Vivienne smiles gently.

                    VIVIENNE
          Sorry to wake you, cherie, but I
          have to leave now. Jean-Paul and
          Julien are already gone. I’ll be
          back tomorrow with more food and
          water. Will you be all right here?

                    SARA
          I think so.

                    VIVIENNE
          Sara, I know it’s a lot to ask, but
          it’s very important that you not
          come down from the loft for any
          reason. Julien explained to you
          about our neighbors, the Lafleurs;
          they’re older and almost never come
          out to the barn, but still.

                    SARA
          I understand. I won’t go down.

                       VIVIENNE
          Good girl.

Vivienne hugs her, about to go -- when Sara clutches her and
starts to cry. Like a small dam has burst.

                     VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
          Ohhh... cherie, I know you’re very
          afraid, but you’ll be back with
          your family soon, okay? And until
          then we’re going to keep you safe,
          I promise.

But Sara can’t stop crying. Vivienne rubs her back, heart
breaking for her. Lets her cry as long as she needs to.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          She thought it was my fear that
          made me cry. But it wasn’t. It
          was a feeling that I would never
          feel my own mother’s arms around me
          again.
                                                        42.


EXT. BARN - DAY

Through a small space between the barn’s uppermost slats, we
can make out Sara’s eyes peering out from within.

BELOW she can see Julien returning from school, crutches
clacking along the dirt road between the houses and the barn.

He steals a look up at the barn, then quickly averts his eyes
when he notices an ELDERLY COUPLE (the LAFLEURS) watching him
suspiciously from their window. Julien waves hello to them,
but they only acknowledge him with a frown.


EXT. BARN - NIGHT

Only now, when the neighborhood is pitch dark and quiet, does
Julien silently hobble across the road to the barn.


INT. BARN - NIGHT

Julien quietly crawls through a discreet hole along the base
of the wall, pushing his crutches through first. Once
through, he slides a piece of wood to re-conceal the hole,
then finds a nearby hurricane lamp and lights it.

                     JULIEN
          Sara?

He peers up to the loft, unable to see past the bales lining
its ledge. Sara rises, casting her shadow against the wall.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Julien has set the lamp down, now unpacking his book bag.
Sara sits across from him, watching him.

                    SARA
          What time is it?

                    JULIEN
          A little after nine, I think.

Beat.

                    SARA
          How many days has it been?   Six?

                    JULIEN
          Today’s the 14th, so... seven.

Sara barely nods.   Then softly, to herself:
                                                          43.


                    SARA
          The bluebells.

                    JULIEN
          Hm?

                    SARA
          Nothing -- I was thinking about the
          bluebells, in the Mernuit. This is
          when they start to bloom. My
          parents and I, we’d always...

She stops herself from crying.   Julien doesn’t know how to
respond.

                    JULIEN
          I, um - brought you something.

He reaches into his book bag, and pulls out a small
collection of colored pencils and some sheets of paper.

                    JULIEN (CONT'D)
          I remember how you like to draw.

Surprised, Sara smiles just a little, the first time in days.

                    SARA
          Thanks, Tour-... Julien.

                    JULIEN
          I also brought some books, and your
          school work so you don’t fall
          behind.
              (glances up)
          I could... teach you today’s
          lessons? If you want?

Her smile has faded to a look akin to guilt.

                    JULIEN (CONT'D)
          Or not.

                    SARA
          You’re being so nice to me...
          I was never very nice to you.    My
          friends certainly weren’t.

                    JULIEN
          I guess I always felt you were, I
          don’t know - different.

Julien looks self-conscious, as if he just admitted a crush.
                                                           44.


                    SARA
          Maybe you’re wrong?

                    JULIEN
          I doubt it... I’m really smart.

Julien grins.   A surprised laugh escapes Sara.

                    SARA
          Is that so?

                    JULIEN
              (shrugs, fake-cocky)
          I mean I don’t like to brag, but...

                    SARA
          No, of course not!


EXT. BARN - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

The sound of their LAUGHTER just barely audible out here,
like a ray of warmth in the cold, dark night.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - DAY

Sara is drawing with the paper and pencils Julien brought.
We see she’s been sketching images of Rose and Max.

On Sara’s face, the unbearable pain of missing them.
The pencil trembles in her grasp as she draws Max’s smile.

A tear drop lands on the paper, blurring a spot.


EXT. BLUM FAMILY FLAT - DAY

Vivienne stands on the steps of the building, “casually”
inquiring about the Doctor who lives upstairs.

                    VIVIENNE
          I clean houses and heard the doctor
          was looking for a new maid?

A cagey NEIGHBOR just shakes her head, answering tersely.

                    CAGEY NEIGHBOR
          I wouldn’t know.
                                                        45.


INT. AUBERVILLIERS HOSPITAL - DAY

Jean-Paul holds his cap between his hands, humbly inquiring
with a guarded RECEPTIONIST.

                    RECEPTIONIST
          He’s no longer with this hospital.

                     JEAN-PAUL
          Oh?   Has he moved?

                    RECEPTIONIST
              (colder)
          I couldn’t say. Would you like see
          another doctor?

Jean-Paul smiles politely and thanks her anyway, then hurries
off... the Receptionist eyeing him uncertainly as he exits.


TIME CUT: INT. BARN - WIDE ON THE HAYLOFT AS SEEN FROM BELOW

By the amber glow of the hurricane lamp we see Sara and
Julien’s shadows against the wall, Julien teaching the day’s
geometry lesson to Sara.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          As the days became weeks, there was
          still no word of my parents. I
          could feel myself losing track of
          time, every day the same as the
          last. There was only one thing I
          could look forward to: my lessons
          with Julien.

We’re not near enough to hear the lesson dialogue, just the
sound of animated talking and the occasional laugh.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Julien is explaining a complicated theorem to Sara.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          I soon realized he was not
          exaggerating when he said he was
          smart. He had the mind of an
          engineer. He could look at
          something mechanical and in minutes
          figure out just how it operated.
                                                           46.


EXT. CINEMA MERNUIT - DAY

A rowdy group of teenage MILICE (militia) patrol the street
outside the theater; we recognize Vincent and Jerome among
their newest recruits, swastika bands around their biceps.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          That is how he wound up working at
          the Cinema Mernuit.


INT. CINEMA MERNUIT - PROJECTIONIST BOOTH - DAY

Julien maneuvering with one crutch as he changes reels.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          The owner Georges had heard about
          this crippled boy who could fix
          almost anything, and one of the
          projectors kept breaking down.
          Georges was so impressed with the
          repair, he offered Julien a job.

Georges pokes his head in to the booth like last time, with
him the same two Resistance fighters.

                    GEORGES
          If anyone asks for me...

Julien NODS dutifully, knows the drill.   Georges exits.

Alone again in the booth, we see a thought occurring to
Julien as he stares hard at the spot Georges just vacated.


INT. CINEMA MERNUIT - CELLAR STAIRCASE - DAY

Julien descends a narrow staircase on his crutches.   We can
hear the MUFFLED VOICES of men and women below.

Julien carefully presses open a heavy door a crack to see --


INT. CINEMA MERNUIT - CELLAR - DAY

-- A DOZEN RESISTANCE FIGHTERS gathered in a clandestine
meeting. Men and women, most younger than Georges, their
faces grim and determined.

                    RESISTANCE FIGHTER
          ...but in the countryside we have
          the advantage. We know the
          terrain, the best roads to ambush.
                                                        47.


                    GEORGES
          My contact in Toulouse says they’re
          shipping us more ammunition...

Georges spots Julien behind the cracked door; their eyes
meet. Georges returns a hard, curious look, then shakes his
head as if to say “you shouldn’t be here.”

Julien nods, quietly shuts the door before others notice him.


INT. CINEMA MERNUIT - PROJECTIONIST BOOTH - DAY

Julien is loading film reels into the heavy cans, when --

                    GEORGES (O.S.)
          The answer is no.

Julien turns to find Georges entering, looking grave.

                    GEORGES (CONT'D)
          The underground is only for those
          willing to die for freedom. Maybe
          you are. But I’m not willing to
          let you.

                       JULIEN
          Okay.

                    GEORGES
              (frowns)
          Okay?

                    JULIEN
          That’s not why I needed to see you.

                       GEORGES
          What then?

Julien hesitates, then steels himself:

                    JULIEN
          I need your help.


INT. BARN - DAY

We see a wicker bag, then a jug of water nudged through the
barn’s entry hole. A beat, then Vivienne crawls in after.

                    VIVIENNE
          Mademoiselle, time for your beauty
          appointment!
                                                        48.


Sara’s face brightens some as she peers down from the loft.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - DAY

Vivienne is washing Sara’s hair over a ceramic bowl.

                    VIVIENNE
          I wanted to come by earlier, but I
          have to be careful.

                    SARA
          The Lafleurs?

                    VIVIENNE
          I swear they never leave that
          window of theirs!

She lathers Sara’s hair, motherly.

                    VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
          You wouldn’t believe how lovely
          they once were to us. Especially
          when Julien became sick.

INSERT (FLASHBACK): MME LAFLEUR HANDS VIVIENNE AND A FRAIL 6-
YR-OLD JULIEN A BASKET OF BRIOCHE ROLLS.

                    VIVIENNE (V.O.)
          Madame Lafleur would make us these
          wonderful breads and cakes, and I’d
          bring her milk from the market.

INSERT: THE LAFLEURS PEER OUT THEIR WINDOW, GRIM AND GUARDED.

                    VIVIENNE (V.O.)
          But since the Occupation, they’ve
          become very secretive. They never
          go out or speak to anyone, ever.
          Except perhaps the Nazis.

BACK TO: SARA AND VIVIENNE

                    SARA
          But Julien says you still bring
          them milk from the market?

                    VIVIENNE
          Every day I leave it by their door.
              (a wry chuckle)
          Little kindnesses wear people down,
          you know?
                                                               49.


Sara chuckles too. Vivienne starts to rinse her hair. Sara
cranes her neck more, when her face suddenly brightens --

                       SARA
          It’s back!

Vivienne is confused, follows Sara’s gaze up to a little
dormer window high above.

                       SARA (CONT'D)
          My bird.

Sure enough, a small white bird is perched there.

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          It comes to visit me every day.

                    VIVIENNE
          It’s beautiful. Like you, now that
          you’re all clean!

Vivienne starts to rub Sara’s hair dry -- when she notices
Sara’s smile fading, a tear forming in the corner of her eye.

                       VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
          Sara?

                    SARA
              (forcing a smile)
          Sorry, it’s just -- my mother used
          to wash my hair sometimes.

Vivienne smiles sadly, feeling for her.

                    VIVIENNE
          I promise we haven’t stopped trying-

She’s interrupted by a sudden THUD below. Sara quickly looks
to Vivienne, who presses a ssh finger to her lips.

Holding their breath, they strain to listen: someone is
definitely just outside. They hear footsteps in the grass,
then the sound of the barn door opening...

They retreat to the corner of the hayloft, scared, when --

                       JULIEN (O.S.)
          Hello?

They both exhale relief.      Step out to find Julien below.

                    VIVIENNE
          Julien, you know you’re not to come
          that way! What if someone saw you?
                                                        50.


                    JULIEN
          Sorry - I was so excited, I forgot.

                    SARA
          Excited about what?


TIME CUT: INT. BARN (EVENING)

Julien now sitting across from Sara and Vivienne.

                    VIVIENNE
          You’re sure you can trust him?

                    JULIEN
          Positive. He said it’ll take a few
          weeks for the woman he knows to
          forge the identity papers. Once we
          have those, Georges will arrange to
          take you to an abbey in Le Chambon.
          The nuns there have been organizing
          crossings into Switzerland.

                    SARA
          ...Switzerland?

                    JULIEN
          It’s five days on foot through the
          Pyrenees. But they’ve gotten a lot
          of Jews out that way. You wouldn’t
          be alone.

Sara nervously turns to Vivienne.   Vivienne nods.

                    SARA
          Honestly, I feel safer here...

                    VIVIENNE
          Oh cherie, I wish you were.

Sara takes a tense breath, considers this.


INT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - CLASSROOM - DAY

Mariann and Sophie are passing notes like they used to...
oblivious to Julien two seats away, crutches propped against
his desk, listening to PASTOR ROBERT’s history lesson:

                    PASTOR ROBERT
          ...After her victory in Orleans,
          Joan was able to convince Charles
          VII to let her join the army, led --
                                                            51.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Julien re-teaching the same day’s lesson to Sara:

                    JULIEN
          -- by the Duke of Alencon, with the
          aim of recapturing the bridges
          along the Loire. Joan then--

                    SARA
          Have you ever been there?

                       JULIEN
          The Loire?

                    SARA
          Switzerland.

Now Julien realizes where her mind is at.

                    JULIEN
              (a small smile)
          I’ve never even been to Paris.

Sara stays quiet.   Julien studies her a beat.

                    JULIEN (CONT'D)
          You know I’d go with you if I
          thought I wouldn’t slow you down.

                    SARA
          I’ll be okay. You said it’ll take
          Georges a few weeks to get the fake
          papers?

                    JULIEN
          First week of June, the latest.
              (a breath)
          I um... I’m going to miss -- you
          know. This.

Julien allows a self-conscious smile.   Sara smiles back.

                       SARA
          Me too.

Julien holds her gaze just a beat -- then awkwardly retrieves
his notebook, about to resume the lesson, when --

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          You’ve really never been to Paris?
                                                        52.


                    JULIEN
          Never even left Dannevilliers
          except to go to school.

Sara considers him a moment, her mind working... She grins.

                    JULIEN (CONT'D)
          What?

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. AVENUE DES CHAMPS-ÉLYSÉES (PARIS) - DAY

AS SEEN THROUGH A CAR WINDSHIELD: Whizzing past Parisians and
well-heeled tourists crowding the sidewalks of the iconic
thoroughfare, past cafes and hotels, bakeries and clothiers.

                    SARA (O.S.)
          Well? How do you like Paris so far?

REVERSE ON SARA AND JULIEN

Sitting in the front seat of the Beaumier’s rusty old car...

                    JULIEN
              (chuckles, self-conscious)
          It’s, um, great.


INT. BARN - NIGHT

... in the corner of the barn amid the hay and old tools.
Sara is behind the wheel, grinning out the dusty windshield.
Julien in the passenger seat, a lot more self-conscious.

                    SARA
          Up ahead is the Place de l’Etoile.
          Do you see the Arc de Triomphe ?

                     JULIEN
              (embarrassed/unconvincing)
          Yyyyes...?

                    SARA
          C’mon, use your imagination! Just
          picture in your mind’s eye, we’re
          entering this big roundabout, with
          twelve smaller avenues radiating
          out from it, like a star...

JULIEN’S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Shapes struggling to emerge in the dusty dark of the barn...
a wide, circular drive... suggestions of smaller avenues...
                                                        53.


                    SARA (CONT'D)
          Those tall, black street lamps
          there, do you see them?

                     JULIEN
          You really want me to say yes,
          don’t you.

                    SARA
              (”scolding”)
          Julien! It’s only fun if you try!

Julien glances over at her, moved by how sincerely she’s into
this. He forces his imagination to engage... as through the
windshield his MIND’S EYE starts to fill in more and more
brightness and detail...

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          Now look there, in the middle of
          the plaza, the Arc de Triomphe -

                    JULIEN
          Wait, I kind of see it now...!

                     SARA
          You do?   Really?

                     JULIEN
          Really!

And for a moment it is as if they are actually in a car on
the Place de l’Etoile, the two of them all grins, peering up
giddily at the magnificent Arc de Triomphe.

                    SARA
          Can I admit something embarrassing?
          I do this at least three times a
          week.

They both laugh at this admission.

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          What, you spend every single day
          alone in a barn!

                    JULIEN
          Watch out for that lady!

Sara gasps, instinctively twists the wheel -- then instantly
catches herself and cracks up more. Julien laughing.

                    SARA
          Alright, just for that we’re
          skipping the Eiffel Tower.
                                                           54.


ON SARA as she “turns” the wheel, grinning straight ahead.

ON JULIEN as he steals a look at her, clearly smitten... and
now realizing how much he’s going to miss her.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - DAY

Propped against a bale, Sara draws an image of her parents
reuniting with her on a mountainside. Her pencil work has
grown more detailed and refined during this forced isolation.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          The next three weeks passed very
          strangely. Time seemed to crawl...


INT. BARN - DAY

Jean-Paul gives Sara a suitcase for her impending journey
while Vivienne measures a warm sweater against Sara’s torso.
Sara steals a glance at Julien across the loft.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          And yet it also seemed to move
          very, very fast.


INT. BARN - NIGHT

Sara and Julien on another “drive,” this time Julien at the
wheel, pointing out the sights to Sara --

Sara beams excitedly out the windshield... at AN AFRICAN
VELDT populated by lions and zebras.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          Almost too fast.


INT. BARN - LATE NIGHT

About to leave, Julien pauses to rub a finger along the rim
of the lamp. Sara grins curiously, wondering what he’s up to
-- when Julien turns to reveal he’s grease-blackened his
eyebrows and smudged on a Charlie Chaplin mustache.

Then, with the practiced moves of someone who’s watched
Chaplin films countless times, Julien does a pitch-perfect
imitation of “The Tramp” saying goodbye, tipping his hat
(beret) with his “cane” (crutch), then leaning on the “cane”
with both hands and batting his lashes.

Sara cracks up, surprised and delighted.
                                                           55.


EXT./INT. CINEMA MERNUIT - ENTRANCE/ LOBBY - MORNING

Julien passes under the marquee and enters the empty lobby,
past a poster for Chaplin’s “City Lights” half-concealed by a
poster for “The Rothschilds,” its artwork an anti-Semitic
caricature of Mayer Rothschild, grinning greedily.


INT. CINEMA MERNUIT - PROJECTIONIST BOOTH - MORNING

Julien opens the door, eager to find Georges... but it’s
empty. Assumes George is in the WC at the edge of the room.

                   JULIEN
          Georges? It’s me, I’m here for the
          papers. Sara’s ready to --

Julien notices a film reel unspooled from a projector in an
unruly pile. He frowns, confused -- when he hears the
faintest sound of VOICES below...


INT. CINEMA MERNUIT - STAIRWELL   - MORNING

Julien arriving at the last of the stairs, making as little
noise as possible with his crutches, the voices growing
louder now. He hugs a wall, careful to stay out of sight...

JULIEN’S POV: THE CELLAR

A squad of MILICE are ransacking the cellar. Film cans have
been pried open, revealing they are filled with smuggled
bullets and guns.

JULIEN

watches breathlessly, and then his eyes go wide in horror --

JULIEN’S POV: THE CELLAR

Georges’s body lies face down in the corner, blood soaking
through the back of his shirt.

The MILICE COMMANDER turns to the youngest in the squad.

                    MILICE COMMANDER
          You boys go up and have some fun.
          We’re gonna send a message: this is
          what happens to traitors.

The three youngest turn and we recognize Vincent among them.
                                                          56.


INT. CINEMA MERNUIT - THEATER - DAY

Julien fleeing fast as he can, but his crutches can only move
so quickly and he must negotiate the sloped aisle...

Suddenly he hears the boys’ ROWDY VOICES about to enter!
Julien manages to scramble to the floor, hiding between two
seat rows just as Vincent and two other MILICE TEENS enter.

One of them fires his pistol at the movie screen. The other
thinks this looks fun, unloads on it too... as Vincent walks
the rows, slashing open seat backs with a combat knife.

TIGHT ON JULIEN HIDING, desperate to stay silent. He can see
their feet and legs moving past, hear their aggressive
laughter, their violence nearing him...

He starts to crawl away on his chest, quiet as he can -- and
then he freezes on seeing --

A FIGURE crouched at the far end of the row, unseen by the
Milice: it’s one of Georges’ young Resistance fighters. The
man is clutching his rifle, lining up a clean shot --

-- at Vincent, whose back is to him...

Julien is gripped by panic, torn but unable to just watch
Vincent be executed this way... His mind racing, Julien
abruptly grabs his crutch --

-- and SMACKS it loudly against the seat back! Both the
Resistance Fighter and Vincent spin to the noise --

-- and in doing so Vincent sees the Resistance Fighter about
to shoot him -- Vincent dives just as the bullet misses him!

The other two Milice fire back at the Resistance Fighter, who
takes cover, returning more fire as he’s joined by another
Resistance Fighter --

Julien seizes his chance and clambers across the floor
unseen, finally making it to the opposite aisle, slipping out
the nearest door as gunfire rattles the theater behind him.


EXT. AUBERVILLIERS-AUX-BOIS - SIDE STREET - DAY

Julien’s crutches clack noisily against the cobblestone as he
moves as fast as he can, expression still etched in fear.

                    SARA (PRE-LAP)
          I’m so sorry...
                                                        57.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Julien stares off, still very shaken, and now despondent.

                    SARA
          I know he was your friend.

                    JULIEN
          He was also your one chance to get
          away.

                    SARA
          We’ll figure something else out.

Julien meets her eyes, and nods firmly.

They sit in silence a moment, listening to the RAIN tapping
on the roof. Then, hoping to lift his spirits:

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          My bird was back again today.

Julien glances over at her.

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          I um... drew a picture of him.   So
          you could meet him.

She reaches for the paper he’d brought her, and we see that
almost every square inch has been covered in drawings. She
points to one of a few drawings she’d made of the white bird.
The detail is pretty astounding.

Julien regards the drawing, forcing himself to smile -- but
Sara can see he’s too overwhelmed to be distracted by this.

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          I’m really so sorry about
          Georges... I can’t imagine what it
          must’ve been like for you.

Julien barely nods. She can see his hand is shaking... She
reaches out and gently retrieves her drawing.

                    JULIEN
          What was that song you once told me
          about? The one your parents used
          to sing? “Little bird, little
          bird”...

She’s a bit embarrassed.   A beat, then softly:
                                                           58.


                    SARA
          “Little bird, little bird,
          How high will you fly?
          As high as the sky,
          As the sky above...”

FLASH ON YOUNG SARA, MAX AND ROSE PICNICING IN THE BLUEBELLS -

A perceptible sadness enters Sara’s voice as she continues:

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          “Little bird, little bird,
          How fast will you go?
          As fast as a crow,
          As fast as a dove.
          Little bird, little bird,
          How far will you see?
              (her voice catches)
          As far as I wish,
          For now I am free.”

The melody’s last few words are hardly audible. Sara glances
up at him with an effortful smile. Julien is visibly moved.

                    JULIEN
          We’re going to find another way to
          get you out. I promise.


EXT. AUBERVILLIERS-AUX-BOIS - MAIN THOROUGHFARE - DAY

SS troops arriving, swastikas painted on their vehicles.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          Julien was determined. But so too
          were the German army...


EXT. DANNEVILLIERS - STREETS - DAY

A NAZI FLAG is draped from the balcony of the village’s only
hotel, German soldiers and French police gathered out front.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          After killing Georges and many
          others in the local Resistance, the
          Germans cracked down on the region,
          setting up new headquarters right
          there in Dannevilliers.


EXT. BEAUMIER’S MULTI-FAMILY HOME - DAY

The elderly Lafleurs grimly peer out a window --
                                                          59.


-- as below Vivienne bids Jean-Paul goodbye as he heads off
to “work.”

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          Now we had far more to worry about
          than just the nosy Lafleurs.


EXT. DANNEVILLIERS OUTSKIRTS - DAY

We recognize the area as where Julien and Sara emerged after
escaping through the Ecole’s sewers. A CHECKPOINT has now
been set up on the road, manned by heavily-armed SOLDIERS.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          Nazis were everywhere, on every
          road in and out of the village...
          There was no way I could be
          smuggled out now.


INT. BARN - DAY

Jean-Paul finishes building for Sara a clever, easy-to-
conceal writing desk that hinges to the floor of the hayloft.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          The Beaumiers tried to make my life
          as bearable as possible.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - DAY

Vivienne chats with Sara while Sara eats hungrily.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          Vivienne continued to keep me fed.
          She’d wash my hair, bring clean
          clothes, empty the bucket I used
          for a toilet. And of course keep
          me company for an hour or two.


INT. BARN - NIGHT

A crutch slides through the hole by the floor... then a
second crutch... then a pack of playing cards...

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          But as summer came and went, it was
          Julien’s nightly visits that
          sustained me.
                                                        60.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Sara and Julien animatedly playing Belote (a card game) by
candlelight, gossiping about other kids from school.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          The barn had become my whole world,
          and Julien its center.

They both reach for a card at the same time -- and their
hands touch. Both instantly glance up, meeting each other’s
eyes, the mutual attraction like a current in the air --

-- then just as quickly drop their eyes, feigning an intense
interest in their respective cards.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Sara and Julien still talking, the candle melted to a nub.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          We had in common one crucial
          thing...


EXT. AUBERVILLIERS-AUX-BOIS - STREET - DAY

Julien hobbles along the cobblestone street, regarded with
pity by those who notice him.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          ...we were different from other
          children.

He pauses before the Cinema Mernuit; its marquee is blank,
its doors spray-painted “JEW LOVER.” Windows smashed.


INT. CINEMA MERNUIT - PROJECTIONIST BOOTH - DAY

The booth has been equally vandalized. Film dumped
everywhere. A projector toppled on the floor.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          We knew the hatred that people were
          capable of.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Sara and Julien sit in opposite corners, Julien reading a
biography of Edison, Sara sketching in a novel’s margins.
                                                        61.


                      GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
            And this cemented our relationship.
            It gave it depth.

Julien steals a look at Sara, smitten... then quickly drops
his eyes back to the page. A beat later, Sara glances up
from her sketch to steal a look at Julien.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Sara and Julien peering out the small window at the stars
above, talking in intimate, hushed voices.

                      GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
            I began to see him as more than my
            rescuer, or even my friend.

TIME CUT:

SARA’S POV OUT THE SAME WINDOW: watching Julien hobble away.

                      GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
            He was my everything. My hope...
            My light.


INT. BARN - NIGHT

Julien “gallantly” opens the car door for Sara.

                      JULIEN
            Special trip tonight, Mademoiselle
            Blum.

                      SARA
                (fake fancy)
            How wonderful! Where to this time?

                      JULIEN
            You’ll see.

He closes the car door for her.

INSIDE THE CAR

Sara sits, waiting for Julien, when she hears a dull THUMP on
the car roof over her head. She’s startled --

                        SARA
            Julien--?
                                                           62.


                    JULIEN (O.S.)
          It’s fine, I swear. Just close
          your eyes, okay?

Sara grins, intrigued.

                    JULIEN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Are they closed?

Sara obeys and closes her eyes.

                     SARA
          Yes!

She waits like this a moment, then hears the sound of the
ENGINE SPARK, the car sputtering to life.

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          Are you crazy? We can’t go driving!

                    JULIEN
          I know, just keep your eyes closed!

Sara reluctantly shuts her eyes again. She can hear the
sound of the driver’s door open, and Julien climbing in.

                    SARA
          Can I look now?

                    JULIEN
          How’d you like to visit New York
          tonight?

                     SARA
          What?   Sure!

                    JULIEN
          Okay then... Open your eyes.

Sara waits a moment, then peeks an eye open -- and suddenly
opens both eyes wide...

... as through the windshield, it looks like they are
literally driving down a neon-lit Broadway -- a black-and-
white Broadway as seen in the 1930s musical film...

CUT OUTSIDE THE CAR (REVEAL)

...that is being projected from atop the car roof by the
projector Julien has recovered from the Cinema Mernuit and
now powered by rigging it to the car’s battery.

Sara stares in total awe, floored by Julien’s ingenuity and
by the sheer beauty of the moment - like a sort of homemade,
                                                           63.


hybrid drive-in movie/V.R. ride circa 1943...   It’s magical.

                    SARA
              (breathless)
          Oh Julien...

Julien beams, lost in the moment as well.   And so are we.

We stay with them like this, as enraptured as they are, until
the BLACK AND WHITE of celluloid Broadway projected on the
old barn wall finally DISSOLVES TO --


EXT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - ENTRANCE - DAY

THE FIRST YELLOWS AND REDS of autumn now dappling the woods.

Children with book sacks walking, scootering and biking up
the road to school. We find Mariann and Sophie among them.


EXT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - COURTYARD - DAY

Pastor Luc stands by the gate, welcoming the students back.
Julien keeps a low profile as he moves past Vincent and his
gang -- but to no avail:

                    VINCENT
          Man, Tourteau, don’t you ever
          bathe? I thought crabs liked water!

Others laugh at Julien, who refuses to make eye contact.

Jerome nudges Vincent, and they start after Julien to torment
him more -- when Pastor Luc arrives and stops Julien first.

                    PASTOR LUC
          Monsieur Beaumier, may I have a
          word in my office?


INT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - PASTOR LUC’S OFFICE - DAY

Julien takes a seat across from Pastor Luc’s desk.

                    JULIEN
          Sir?

Pastor Luc smiles warmly, but there is a weariness in it.

                    PASTOR LUC
          The teachers and I have been
          talking, and we’ve decided to place
          you in advanced mathematics this
                    (MORE)
                                                           64.

                    PASTOR LUC (CONT'D)
          year. You’ll be with the older
          students, but I suspect they’ll be
          the ones trying to keep up.

                    JULIEN
              (smiles proudly)
          Thank you, sir.

                    PASTOR LUC
          Thank you, Julien. There isn’t
          much that brings me joy these days.

He rises, and Julien follows suit, but as Pastor Luc reaches
over to shake his hand, Julien notices something on a shelf --

Sara’s sketchbook! Carefully stored up here along with some
other items the Jewish children were forced to leave behind.

He drops his eyes before Pastor Luc realizes he’s seen it.


EXT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - LATE DAY

The bustle of kids filing out at the end of the day.


INT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - LATE DAY

POV THROUGH AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW: we see Pastor Luc heading
home as well, climbing onto his bicycle.

REVERSE ON JULIEN at the window.   WIDEN to

THE HALLWAY

As Julien quickly hurries down the empty corridor...


INT. PASTOR LUC’S OFFICE - LATE DAY

The door creaks open and Julien enters. He hesitates just a
moment -- then takes Sara’s sketchbook off the shelf.


INT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

ANONYMOUS POV FROM DOWN THE HALL: Julien slips out, eyes
peeled to check if anyone’s watching, then hurries off.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - DUSK

We hear the sound of a BIG BAND playing swing as we SLOW PAN
over to... Sara dancing by herself, lost in her imagination
                                                          65.


(as evidenced by a wider shot to remind us there’s no actual
music playing). She’s letting loose, savoring a tiny taste
of freedom, at least in her mind --

-- when she abruptly stops, hearing a familiar sound that
brings a bigger grin to her face...


INT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

Sara hurries to the hole through which Julien always sneaks
in: he’s already slid one crutch through, the second crutch
follows, then his book bag... then finally Julien himself.

                    SARA
          You’re here so early.   Is
          everything okay?

                    JULIEN
          This couldn’t wait.

Getting to his feet, he pauses, noticing how she’s a little
out of breath, her hair still a bit wild from the dancing.

                    SARA
              (grins, embarrassed)
          I was...dancing. What couldn’t
          wait?

Julien reaches into his book bag; it takes Sara less than a
second to recognize her sketchbook as he takes it out.

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          My sketchbook!! How did you...?

                    JULIEN
          I was in Pastor Luc’s and I saw it
          on the--

She cuts him off with an impulsive hug around his neck.

                       SARA
          Thank you!

The impulsive physical contact reverberates through them a
beat -- then, chuckling nervously, Sara returns to her
cherished book, flipping through page by page.

Julien peers over her shoulder at the myriad drawings of
birds, animals, random objects -- and then, that sketch she
had drawn of Vincent. Sara quickly glances up at Julien to
find he’s staring at it too; he’s clearly stung, but tries
not show it. Sara, however, is abashed.
                                                        66.


                       SARA (CONT'D)
             I was so dumb--

A SUDDEN SOUND from outside the barn stops them both. They
hold their breath, listening to FOOTSTEPS approaching fast.
Julien instantly extinguishes the hurricane lamp. Darkness.

                       SARA (CONT'D)
             What is it?!

                       JULIEN
             Ssh! Go back up and hide - and
             don’t come out, no matter what.

Terrified, Sara scrambles up to --

THE HAYLOFT

Hiding in a corner beneath the rafters, she conceals herself
in the hay; she can hear the rustle of bats above her,
stirred -- then the barn door suddenly BANG open below.

                       TEEN BOY’S VOICE (O.S.)
             ...telling you, I bet he’s in here.
             Tourteau! Hey, Tourteau!

DOWN BELOW

We see three young men shining a flashlight as they enter.
As our eyes adjust to the glare, we recognize Vincent,
Jerome, and another teen (HENRI).

                       JULIEN (O.S.)
             Hello?

Vincent swings his flashlight... to find Julien bent over the
open hood of the car, illuminated by his hurricane lamp - as
if they just interrupted him trying to repair the engine.

                       VINCENT
             What’s going on, Tourteau?

                       JULIEN
             What are you doing here? I’m
             working on my father’s car--

                       JEROME
             We saw you sneaking out of Pastor
             Luc’s office with something.

                       JULIEN
             What?

They’re moving in closer, leering menacingly.
                                                          67.


                    VINCENT
          Don’t play dumb with us, cripple.

                    JULIEN
          I left my book there.   So what?

                      VINCENT
          Bullshit.

                    JULIEN
          I swear. It’s in my house, I can
          show you right now--

                    HENRI
          Vincent, look.

He nudges Vincent, who follows his flashlight beam to a far
corner, where we see Julien has left the projector.

                     JEROME
          See?   Told you he was a thief!

                    JULIEN
          Georges gave it to me to fix for hi-

SMACK! Vincent backhands Julien with his flashlight and
Julien drops to the floor.

                    VINCENT
          You’re a bad liar, Tourteau.

Henri KICKS Julien in the ribs.   Julien HOWLS in pain.

INSERT: SARA HIDING IN THE LOFT

Listening in horror...

                    JEROME (O.S.)
          What’d you steal from Pastor Luc?

                      JULIEN (O.S.)
          Nothing!    I just left my-- AH!

The sound of two more kicks.

BACK TO JULIEN AND THE TEENS

Vincent pulls Julien up by his collar.

                    VINCENT
          You think you’re smarter than
          everyone, don’t you?
                                                           68.


                    JULIEN
          N-no...

                    VINCENT
          You’re pathetic, you know that?
          Weak. Deformed. Useless.

Julien glares back at him, fear mingling with rage and pain.

                    VINCENT (CONT'D)
          Know what the Nazis do with freaks
          like you? Do you? They
          exterminate them. Like Jews.

He punches Julien across the face, hurls him to the ground.

                     VINCENT (CONT'D)
          I should do the human race a favor
          and put you out of your misery
          right now.

TIGHT ON SARA IN THE HAYLOFT

Hears this, terrified for Julien. She can’t stop herself
from crawling to the edge of the loft to see --

BELOW

Vincent has dropped his flashlight and is crouched over
Julien now. He lifts him just enough to PUNCH him again -
then again - each one harder. Jerome and Henri get nervous.

                    JEROME
          He learned his lesson, Vincent.

                    VINCENT
          Not yet he hasn’t.

CRACK of Vincent’s fist across Julien’s face again.   Again.

Julien spits blood, staring up helplessly... when he sees --

(JULIEN’S POV) SARA PEERING DOWN IN HORROR FROM THE LOFT

Julien tries to shake his head, urging her to stay hidden --

(JULIEN’S POV) BUT SARA SEEMS DESPERATE TO SAVE HIM SOMEHOW --

                    VINCENT (CONT'D)
          The hell are you looking at, freak?

Vincent starts to turn his head, when --
                                                          69.


                    JULIEN
          V-vive l’humanite...

Vincent immediately glowers back down at Julien.

                    VINCENT
          What’d you say?

                    JULIEN
          Vive..... l’humanite.

Vincent flashes anger, cocking his fist to pummel him again --

When Julien quickly grabs for VINCENT’S FLASHLIGHT and swings
the beam up, aiming directly into

THE RAFTERS

Illuminating the small army of bats nesting there! They
start to react to the light, stirring restlessly...

                    JEROME
          What the...?!

Even Vincent looks creeped out -- Julien still shining the
beam’s bright light directly at the bats, their agitated
noises growing louder... louder... LOUDER --

                    HENRI
          Let’s get out of--

AND SUDDENLY THE BATS SWARM DOWN EN MASSE FROM THE RAFTERS!
Vincent dives as bats swoosh right over him, his pals already
bolting out the door screaming, Vincent darting close behind
as the bats burst out the barn door with him...

ON SARA

Amazed, she hurries to the slat in the wall, peers out...
to see the three teens running down the road, disappearing
into the darkness.

BELOW - MOMENTS LATER

Julien tries to sit up, blood caked around his nose and
mouth. Staining his shirt.

                    SARA (O.S.)
          Julien!

Sara arrives below, rushing to his side as he fumbles for his
crutches.
                                                         70.


                    SARA (CONT'D)
          Julien, are you--

                    JULIEN
              (mutters)
          Go back to the loft... they could
          come back...

                    SARA
          I saw them go, it’s--

                    JULIEN
          I said GO TO THE LOFT!
              (off Sara’s shock)
          What are you, stupid?!    Go!

Tears sting Julien’s eyes as he glares at a stunned Sara.

                    SARA
          I just wanted to--

                    JULIEN
          I don’t care what you want!     It’s
          not always about you!

Sara takes a step back, on the verge of tears herself.

                    JULIEN (CONT'D)
          You know what happens if they find
          you?! They’ll arrest my parents!
          They’ll execute them, understand?!

                    SARA
          I -- you’re right, I didn’t think -

                    JULIEN
          Of course you didn’t! All you
          think about is yourself! You’re
          still the same spoiled brat who sat
          next to me for five years and
          didn’t even know my name!

He turns from her so she can’t see his furious tears.

                    SARA
          Julien, please... I’m so sorry.

A painful silence.   Then:

                    JULIEN
          Just go back to the loft, Sara.

He grabs his other crutch and hobbles to the door.
                                                        71.


Sara retreats to the loft as she hears him leaving, shutting
the door behind him... and then allows her own tears to flow.


INT. BEAUMIER’S HOME - NIGHT

Jean-Paul fights back tears of his own as he sits by his
son’s bed, watching Vivienne apply an ice pack to his face.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Sara peers down sadly at her old sketchbook, flipping slowly,
page after page.

She arrives at her sketch of Vincent. Stares at it a beat --
then tears the page out, crumples it and adds it to the flame
burning in her hurricane lamp.


INT. PASTOR LUC'S OFFICE - DAY

Vivienne and Jean-Paul meeting with Pastor Luc.

                    PASTOR LUC
          We need to report this to the
          police.

                    JEAN-PAUL
          No. We just want you to speak to
          the boy. Threaten to expel him if
          he goes near Julien again.

Pastor Luc nods, allows a painful sigh.

                    PASTOR LUC
          What’s happened to our world? Every
          day I pray, but God stays silent.

                    VIVIENNE
          With all due respect, Father, it’s
          not up to God. Only good people
          can end this.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - DAY

Vivienne is washing Sara’s hair.

                    SARA
          It’s been days since he’s come by.

                    VIVIENNE
          Let’s give him time.
                                                  72.


                    SARA
              (peers up at her)
          Vivienne... I’m sorry.

Vivienne glances down at her, confused.

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          I never realized how much danger I
          put your family in by being here.

                    VIVIENNE
          Oh cherie, you mustn’t worry about
          us. We’ll be fine. Just like you
          will be too.

                     SARA
              (beat)
          What about Julien?

                    VIVIENNE
          He needs time to heal, that’s all.

                    SARA
          He got so mad at me.

                    VIVIENNE
          He was just as mad at himself   for
          leading Vincent to the barn.    The
          truth is he should never have   taken
          your sketchbook. It was much    too
          risky, for all of us.

                    SARA
          He did it for me.

Vivienne nods gently.

                    VIVIENNE
          It was an act of kindness. In
          times like these, it’s those small
          things that remind us of our
          humanity.

Sara peers up at her.

                    SARA
          Vive l’humanite.

                    VIVIENNE
              (an emotional smile)
          Vive l’humanite.
                                                        73.


EXT. BARN - DUSK

The last leaves of autumn flutter from the trees that line
the field, night falling on the stone barn.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          Another week passed. Then another.
          It was almost winter now. And
          still Julien stayed away.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - DAY

The white bird is resting. Sara reaches out very carefully,
and it allows her to stroke its feathers. She smiles sadly.

She hears the familiar sound of crutches on a dirt road. She
peers out the slat to see Julien returning home from school.

He does not look up at the barn.


INT. BARN - NIGHT

Sara is lying back, trying to force herself to sleep -- when
she hears another familiar sound: a crutch sliding in through
the hole in the barn’s siding.

Sara quickly sits up, scurrying to the edge of the loft -- to
see the second crutch slide in. She holds her breath,
peering down... as a deck of cards then slides through.

A hopeful smile spreads across her face.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Sara and Julien playing Belote, but neither one is talking.
It’s as awkward as we’ve ever seen them.

                       JULIEN
                 (quietly)
          You.

Sara flips a card.

                    SARA
          Can we talk about--

                    JULIEN
          I’d rather not.

                         SARA
          Oh.    Okay.
                                                              74.


They keep playing in uncomfortable silence.

             SARA (CONT'D)                       JULIEN
 It just seems weird to not -        Can we just let it go?

More silence. Julien staring hard at his cards -- and then
abruptly sets them down.

                         JULIEN (CONT'D)
             I hate --

He stops himself.     Struggling for the words.

                       JULIEN (CONT'D)
             I hate that you saw me like that.

                        SARA
                 (confused)
             Like what?

                        JULIEN
             Like some weakling.   A helpless,
             pathetic--

                       SARA
                 (feeling for him)
             Julien, no -

                       JULIEN
             I know it’s hard to believe, but I
             used to run fast. Before I got
             polio, I was the fastest kid in my
             whole class. I still remember what
             that felt like, to run like that.
             To be strong.

                       SARA
             You are strong.

He scoffs.

                       SARA (CONT'D)
             You are. And brave. You’re the
             bravest person I ever met.

                       JULIEN
                 (humiliated)
             Why, because I walk with crutches?
             Crutches don’t make me brave. They
             make me walk.

                       SARA
             That’s - not what I meant.
                                                   75.


Julien just picks up his cards, stares at them.

                    JULIEN
          Can we just stop talking please?
          The worst thing is feeling you pity
          me. Poor Julien. Poor Torteau.

                    SARA
          That’s not how I feel.
              (off his look)
          What I feel is just... dumb. I
          thought about what you said, how
          I’m selfish -

                    JULIEN
          I was just upset, I didn’t mean it.

                    SARA
          But it’s true. When I think about
          how I was before, how kids would
          call you names, and I just... stood
          there. I didn’t care. Not really.
              (getting emotional)
          The truth is, if you were the one
          who needed saving, I probably
          wouldn’t have done it.

                    JULIEN
          You don’t know that.

                      SARA
          No, I do.    And I’m sorry.

He looks up at her, smiles a little.    Touched.

                    JULIEN
          You did try to save me though.
          That night with Vincent, I saw you
          about to come down from the loft.
          You were going to risk your life --

                    SARA
          I would’ve gotten us both killed.

                      JULIEN
          Probably.

They share a wry gallows smile.

                    JULIEN (CONT'D)
          Still, it was brave of you.

Sara shrugs, at once embarrassed and grateful.
                                                           76.


                    JULIEN (CONT'D)
          Take a compliment!

                    SARA
              (blushes)
          Fine. Thank you.

A beat, both smiling, relieved to be patching things up.

                    JULIEN
          Should we get back to the game now?

                   SARA
          Okay. Can I just say one last
          thing?

                    JULIEN
          What?

                    SARA
          Belote!

She tosses her winning hand down in front of him.

                    JULIEN
          Look who finally won a hand.
              (grins)
          I wouldn’t get too used to it.

                    SARA
              (laughs)
          Oh no?

Julien scoops up the cards and deals a new hand. Sara
smiles, beyond relieved to have him back with her again.


EXT. DANNEVILLIERS - AERIAL - DAY

Snow falls on the village.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          Winter came, and with it many
          changes.


EXT. AUBERVILLES AUX BOIS - STREETS - DAY

German military trucks squeeze through snowy streets.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          More and more soldiers arrived.
          The rations were brutal.
                                                           77.


INT. BOULANGERIE BALLOU - DAY

Madame Ballou’s bakery is a shell of itself, now reduced to a
few hard loaves handed out to rowdy Nazi troops.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          Everyone knew hunger.


EXT. DANNEVILLIERS - OCCUPYING HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Vincent and other young men in black Milice uniforms are
issued automatic rifles by their Nazi handlers.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          Vincent quit school to serve the
          Milice full-time.

Vincent returns a Seig Heil salute and a “Heil Hitler!”


EXT. DANNEVILLIERS - STREET - DAY

TWO OLD MEN shiver in the snow as Vincent and another Milice
roughly demand to see their papers.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          The streets became more dangerous.


EXT. DANNEVILLIERS OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Julien struggles to maneuver crutches through knee-deep snow.

                     GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          And Julien often took the long way
          to school.


INT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - HALLWAY/ CLASSROOM - DAY

Sweaty and half-frozen, Julien hobbles past Pastor Luc’s
office, but a NEW PASTOR is there now.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          In January, Pastor Luc disappeared.
          There were whispers... Rumors that
          he’d joined the Resistance.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - DAY

Sara marks her height against a post. She steps back, sees
she’s grown at least two inches since she came here.
                                                          78.


                     GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
           There were other changes too.

She regards her body, her figure less girlish, more mature.
She runs a hand through her hair, longer than before.

TIME CUT

Sara drawing in her sketchbook... a portrait of Julien.   She
smiles to herself as she fills in details of his face.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Sara is working on the day’s math assignment while Julien
frowns over a small piece of wood he’s whittling.

Julien sets his knife down, shows the results to Sara.

                     JULIEN
           Well?

                     SARA
               (over-enthusiastic)
           What a pretty... sheeeep?

                     JULIEN
           Cat.

                     SARA
           Cat, right! Of course.

Julien grins, fully aware of his artistic limitations.

TIGHT ON SARA watching Julien as he laughs. We can see
something has stirred in her... a feeling that has blossomed
beyond mere friendship.


EXT. FIELD/ BARN - DAWN

TIME LAPSE: THE SNOW THAT BLANKETS THE FIELD AND BARN GIVES
WAY TO THE FIRST GREENS OF SPRING...

                     GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
           Before I knew it, it was spring
           again. Impossible as it seemed,
           I’d been in hiding for over a year.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - NIGHT

Sara hears the familiar sound of Julien arriving at the hole
in the barn. Sara hurries down from the loft...
                                                             79.


... to find a small package on the floor? Like a little
present, wrapped in newspaper. She picks it up, unwraps it --

-- and discovers a little wooden bird, hand-whittled by
Julien. Sara beams, when --

                     VIVIENNE/JEAN PAUL/JULIEN (O.S.)
           Happy Birthday to you...

Sara looks surprised, turns to see the barn door open and the
Beaumier family enter, Vivienne carrying a chocolate cake
with a candle in it. Jean-Paul is toting a small radio.

                     VIVIENNE/JEAN PAUL/JULIEN    (CONT'D)
           Happy Birthday to you, Happy
           Birthday dear Sara, Happy Birthday
           to you!

                     SARA
           I don’t -- I didn’t even realize it
           was today --

                     VIVIENNE
           Happy birthday, cherie.

Vivienne sets the cake down on the small table.

                     SARA
           Is it really chocolate?

                     JEAN-PAUL
           Vivienne has been saving ration
           cards for months.

                     JULIEN
           Make a wish, Blum.

She meets Julien’s eyes just a moment, then blows out her
candle. Vivienne and Jean-Paul clap, hug her lovingly.

TIME CUT

The family and Sara hungrily eating the delicious cake.

                     SARA
               (between mouthfuls)
           But how’d you get past the
           Lafleurs?

                     VIVIENNE
               (smiles)
           We did something naughty, God
           forgive us.
                                                        80.


                    JEAN-PAUL
          Last week I had a tooth pulled, and
          the doctor gave me sleeping powder
          for the pain. I had a little extra -

                    JULIEN
          So Maman put it in the Lafleurs’
          milk this afternoon. We could hear
          them snoring through the walls!

They all laugh.   Vivienne turns to her husband.

                    VIVIENNE
          Now then, I was promised there’d be
          dancing.

                    JEAN-PAUL
          But of course!

Jean-Paul turns on the little radio, careful to keep the
volume low. We hear the sound of a big band playing the Duke
Ellington ballad “In a Sentimental Mood.”

                    JEAN-PAUL (CONT'D)
              (taking Vivienne’s hand)
          Madame?

Vivienne happily accepts and starts to dance with Jean-Paul.
She steals a quick look over her shoulder at Julien, nodding
toward Sara ala “go on,” but he looks uncertain.

                      SARA (O.S.)
          Monsieur?

Julien turns to find Sara before him, holding out a hand,
smiling but a little nervous herself.

Julien hesitates - then sets his crutches aside, allows her
to help him to his feet... and they dance, he with crutches.

Sara can feel Julien’s body trembling with the effort
required to dance without crutches, and does her best to keep
him supported without making him self-conscious.

Their faces are quite close, Julien holding his breath,
taking in her smell, her proximity. She leans in to him.

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          Thank you for my present.

                    JULIEN
          It’s a bird.
                                                           81.


                    SARA
          I could see that.

                     JULIEN
          It only took me seven tries.
          The first five looked more like
          dinosaurs.

Sara chuckles.    He smiles.   They dance.   And then --

                    RADIO ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO)
          Radio London interrupts this
          broadcast to bring you developing
          news: Monte Cassino has been
          liberated by the Allies.

The Beaumiers, Julien and Sara go still, listening intently:

                    RADIO ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO) (CONT'D)
          The First German Parachute Division
          has been destroyed, clearing the
          path to Rome for the Allies...

                    JEAN-PAUL
          France will be next!

                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO)
          ...to the west, the French
          Expeditionary Corps have taken
          Esperia...

                    VIVIENNE
          I can’t believe it! The war --
          it’s going to be over soon!

Vivienne and Jean-Paul embrace each other, then the kids.
Everyone hugging, flush with hope, tears of joy flowing.

We hold on them like this, hugging each other.     Celebrating.


EXT. BARN - HAYLOFT - LATE NIGHT

Sara fast asleep on her hay bed, a faint smile still
lingering on her face.

Sara stirs at a sound from below, looking alarmed.

                      JULIEN (O.S)
          Sara.

She breathes relief, crawls sleepily to the edge of the loft.
                                                           82.


                    SARA
          What are you doing here?   It must
          be after midnight!

                    JULIEN
          Put a sweater on, and your shoes.

                      SARA
          What?

                    JULIEN
          Just trust me. I’ve got one more
          present for you.

BELOW - MOMENTS LATER

In her sweater and shoes, Sara joins Julien by the door.

                    SARA
          A walk - are you crazy?    What about
          the Lafleurs?

                    JULIEN
          That sleeping powder knocked them
          out. I could still hear them
          snoring through the walls.
              (smiles)
          It’s safe, I promise. This may be
          our only chance. And I want you to
          see something.


EXT. THE BARN - NIGHT

Sara steps out of the barn, taking a moment to embrace this
small sense of freedom. She blinks back a tear.

                      JULIEN
          You okay?

                    SARA
          Yeah, I just... I haven’t been
          outside in...

She trails off, overcome by the thought.   He smiles at her.

                      JULIEN
          Come on.

He starts off on his crutches.   She follows, greedily
inhaling the cool night air.
                                                            83.


EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Julien leading Sara through a dense maze of trees.

                    JULIEN
          Do you recognize it?    You probably
          never came this way.

                    SARA
              (smiles)
          The Mernuit?

Julien nods, keeps leading the way.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          I’d never been there at night
          before. All the stories about giant
          wolves would have scared me away.

Julien continues to lead them up an incline.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          But that night I felt no fear.

They’re almost at the peak.   Julien pauses, turns to Sara.

                    JULIEN
          All right, we’re here.

Sara looks around at the dark trees, confused.

                     SARA
          We are?

Julien nods for her to follow him just a few more steps.
Sara does... and suddenly her eyes go wide in amazement.

She turns to him, beaming.    He smiles back at her.

                    JULIEN
          Happy birthday.

Sara gazes out ahead of her as we come around to see...

THE FOREST FLOOR BEFORE THEM IS A SEA OF BLUEBELLS, LITERALLY
SPARKLING IN THE MOONLIGHT.

Sara is overwhelmed by its beauty and the intense nostalgia
it evokes. She and Julien start forward into the clearing
together, as if in a shared dream.

For a moment, neither dares break the spell.     Finally:
                                                          84.


                    JULIEN (CONT'D)
          There’s something I want to say,
          and I feel like if I don’t do it
          now, then I’ll never, um...

He exhales, nervous.    She turns to him, searching his face.

                    JULIEN (CONT'D)
          Here’s the thing... if the war is
          really going to end soon, well -
          when it does, I want you to know
          that in the future I see for
          myself, I, um - well you’re a part
          of it, and I’m wondering if--

                       SARA
          Yes.

                    JULIEN
          I haven’t even asked the question
          yet.

                    SARA
          But I know the answer.    Yes.

Sara leans in and KISSES him. It’s a bit awkward at first,
clearly a first kiss for both...

...but in moments they’re swept up in it, the kiss more
passionate, the pair holding each other tight in the glowing
sea of bluebells.


EXT. WOODS - LATE NIGHT

Sara and Julien returning as they came, but now her hand is
holding his where it meets his crutch, the two walking side
by side as she leans her head on his shoulder.


INT. BARN - LATE NIGHT

Sara and Julien inside again.

                    SARA
          You should go. The sun’ll be up
          soon.

                       JULIEN
          Yeah.

But neither one wants to move.   They chuckle.

He finally kisses her one last time.
                                                          85.


                    JULIEN (CONT'D)
          See you tomorrow.

                     SARA
          You know where to find me.
               (then, a thought)
          Wait. I want to give you something
          too.

Sara climbs up into the hayloft, returns a moment later with
her sketchbook. He’s at once surprised and moved.

                    JULIEN
          Really?

She nods, smiling as she hands it to him.

                    SARA
          See you tomorrow.

Julien starts for the door, floating on a cloud, his heart
brimming. He turns back to Sara as she’s climbing back up to
the loft, and waves his cap high above his head:

                    JULIEN
          Vive l’humanite!

Sara beams back, her heart just as full as Julien finalizes
his departure with a Chaplin-esque “hat” and “cane” goodbye.


INT. BEAUMIER'S HOME - JULIEN’S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Our first time here, the room is small but entirely Julien,
books stacked everywhere, walls decorated with old lobby
cards for films by Chaplin, Keaton and the Marx Brothers.

Julien lies in bed, staring at a page in Sara’s sketchbook...
it’s the portrait she’s drawn of him. We can feel her love
for him in every detail, every carefully etched line.

On the opposite page, we see a poem she’s written, that
begins: “I used to be afraid of the night...”

                    SARA’S VOICE (V.O.)
          “I used to be afraid of the night.
          But now I see it as my time for
          listening to the soul of the world
          telling me its secrets, over and
          over, like a song: ‘You love
          Julien.’ Yes, I answer, I know.
          I love Julien.”

Julien stares at the words, the drawing.    His head swimming.
                                                           86.


No chance of him ever falling asleep tonight.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          I did. I loved him. I wasn’t brave
          enough to say it that night, but I
          decided the next night I would.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - LATE NIGHT

Sara lies in bed, smiling at the little wooden bird Julien
worked so hard to carve for her.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          And maybe he would say he loved me
          too.

Sara leans back, blissful --

FLASHBACK TO HOURS EARLIER: JULIEN SMILING BACK AT SARA AS HE
WAVES HIS CAP OVER HIS HEAD.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          I didn’t know that I would never
          see his face again.


INT. BEAUMIER'S HOME - JULIEN’S ROOM - DAWN

Julien getting dressed for school, still re-reading the poem
beside Sara’s portrait of him.

                     VIVIENNE (O.S.)
          Julien?   You’ll be late for school!

Julien quickly stuffs the sketchbook into his book bag a
second before Vivienne opens the door.

                    JULIEN
          Bonjour, Maman!

He bounds up on his crutches, kissing her on the cheek as he
hurries past, unable to conceal his buoyant spirit.

                    VIVIENNE
          Someone’s in a good mood.

                    JULIEN
          Why not? The sun is shining,
          bluebells are blooming...

                       VIVIENNE
          Bluebells?
                                                           87.


Julien just grins and hurries down the stairs.

                      JULIEN
            À bientôt, Maman!    Arrivederci!

Vivienne chuckles, intuiting the reason for his good mood.


EXT. DANNEVILLIERS - STREETS - EARLY MORNING

Julien is hurrying along the street, book bag strapped across
his chest, a far away smile lingering on his face.

Julien fails to notice a group of GERMAN SOLDIERS gathered by
a pair of military vehicles, chatting with some Milice.

We recognize Vincent among them; a bit in awe of the
soldiers, listening eagerly to their conversation, laughing
hard at their jokes... when Vincent’s focus falls on the
familiar figure hobbling up the street.

Vincent smirks, happy for this stroke of luck. He taps one
of the German officers, gestures toward Julien, approaching.

ON JULIEN

Still unaware of them -- until he is. He slows, realizing
his grave mistake... he turns to avoid their notice, when --

                         GERMAN SOLDIER
            You there!     Cripple!

Julien halts, debating whether to flee or not. It’s too
late, the Soldier and a second Soldier are marching over.

                         GERMAN SOLDIER 2
            Papers.

Julien reaches into his bag, nervously finds his papers.

                      JULIEN
            I’m just on my way to school, the
            Ecole Lafayette -

                      GERMAN SOLDIER
            We can take you.

Julien is about to protest, but they each seize an arm,
yanking him forward, knocking his bag to the ground.

                      JULIEN
            Wait -- my bag!

They shove him into the open door of a jeep, slam it shut.
                                                           88.


One of them barks something in German to the driver -- and
before Julien can get another word out the jeep ROARS away.

Among the witnesses is a MAN in a sewer worker’s uniform.

ON VINCENT

Proud of his handiwork, he crosses to the spot where Julien
was just taken. Julien’s ragged book bag, his cap, and one
of his crutches lay strewn on the street.

Vincent kicks the crutch aside, then bends and rifles through
Julien’s bag to see if there’s anything worth seizing. Just
some books, a pencil... wait - what’s this?

A sketchbook. Curious, Vincent picks it up, and as he starts
to flip through pages, we see on his face: he recognizes it.

A dark, puzzled look as he lifts his eyes, working over why
Sara Blum’s sketchbook would somehow be in Tourteau’s bag...
And all it once, it hits him.

                       VINCENT
                 (darkly, to himself)
             The barn.


INT. BARN - HAYLOFT - MORNING

Sara stirs to the sound of the fluttering of wings. She sits
up, finds her white bird has returned to its little perch.

Sara smiles at it, still buzzing from last night -- when
something startles the white bird, and it takes flight.

Sara’s puzzled -- when she hears a faint sound outside: a
motorized whining, coming nearer...? Worried, Sara moves to
the slats the bird just vacated, peers out...

SARA’S POV: A young man in a Milice uniform comes roaring
down the road on a motorbike. Sara looks concerned --

-- then instantly alarmed when the rider looks up: Vincent.


INT. LOCAL EGOUTIER’S ADMINISTRATION - LOCKERS - DAY

Jean-Paul is changing into his sewer worker’s uniform --

                          SEWER WORKER (O.S.)
             Jean-Paul!

He looks up to find the Sewer Worker who witnessed Julien’s
arrest hurrying over, lowering his voice:
                                                           89.


                    SEWER WORKER (CONT'D)
          It’s your son, Julien.

Jean-Paul immediately goes ashen --


EXT. BARN - DAY

Vincent has left his motorbike in the tall grass, marches
quietly to the barn door -- then KICKS it in with his boot.


INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

Vincent enters, stalking through the barn, automatic rifle in
hand, a predatory grin on his handsome face.

IN THE HAYLOFT

Hiding in the bales, Sara holds her breath, terrified,
listening to his boots clomping through the barn below.

BELOW

Vincent takes his time, savoring the hunt. He raises his gun
and UNLEASHES A THUNDEROUS ROUND OF GUNFIRE into the old car,
shattering the windows and punching holes in its rusty sides.

IN THE HAYLOFT

Sara shudders at the concussive noise, clutching herself
tighter, when:

                    VINCENT (O.S.)
              (calling out, below)
          It’s Sara, right? The little
          missing Jewess.

Sara’s terror spiking, eyes gripped in fear...

BELOW

Vincent prowls, scanning the barn.

                    VINCENT (CONT'D)
          I know you’re in here. Come out
          now and I won’t hurt you, I swear.

Vincent’s eyes land on the loft. Whatever’s up there is
concealed by the stacks of hay bales. Vincent smirks...

Then whips his gun up and fires a spray of automatic rounds
up at the loft, the majority of them punching holes in the
barn’s ceiling. Dozens of light beams spill in from above.
                                                           90.


ON SARA

Petrified. Beams strafe the shadows in which she’s hidden.
She peers up through the hay bales, listening in horror...

... to the sound of Vincent starting to climb up on the
barrel that allows access to the loft...

ON VINCENT

Rifle strapped across his back, he reaches for the hayloft
ledge to pull himself up --

-- when Sara’s foot comes down hard on his knuckles!

                    VINCENT (CONT'D)
             AH!

Vincent falls back down to the barn floor.   Above him he can
hear Sara scrambling --

IN THE HAYLOFT

Sara frantically climbs up a post and punches at the holes in
the roof, creating a hole large enough to crawl up through...

She reaches up and does just that -- as around her more
gunshots shred the hayloft and the roof!


EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

Sara bolts along the rooftop to the edge -- and JUMPS --

-- landing with a hard THUD on the muddy ground below.    She
leaps to her feet and takes off in a sprint when --

BANG! The barn door slams open behind her, then the sound of
MORE GUNSHOTS! Sara refuses to glance back, sprinting with
all her might toward the treeline beyond!


EXT. WOODS (THE MERNUIT) - DAY

Sara bolting through the maze of trees, nearly tumbling over
roots, branches ripping at her arms.

Running... Running... Running... she gasps for breath,
desperately searching for the best path to escape...

She clambers down an incline --

-- and abruptly freezes.   Follow her gaze up ahead to find...
                                                        91.


A LARGE WOLF. The ferocious-looking creature is rooting
through something in the wet leaves, temporarily distracted.

Sara holds her breath, backing away as noiselessly as she
can...

Then breaks into a run again, searching for another direction
to flee... when she hears the sound of rapid boot-fall coming
closer!

She looks around, terrified of being spotted --

-- she does the only thing she can: ducks behind the biggest
tree she can find, her back pressed against its large trunk.

VINCENT

Jogs into view, automatic rifle raised. He scans the trees
around him, knows she couldn’t have gotten far.

                    VINCENT
          You shouldn’t have run, Jew girl!

He OPENS FIRE into the trees, shredding trunks, the gunshots
echoing eerily throughout the Mernuit.

SARA

Shuts her eyes, knows it’s only a matter of time before he
finds her - and if she runs, he’ll shoot her for sure...

VINCENT

Still firing with abandon, until the CLIK-CLIK-CLIK sound
tells him his magazine is spent.

He ejects it, hunting in his belt for a fresh one --

-- when Sara bolts from behind the tree and makes a run for
it! Vincent laughs cruelly and sprints after her, hot on her
tail...

Sara running as hard as she can, stealing just a glance back -
when her foot snags a root and she goes flying, hitting the
ground hard! She frantically starts to pick herself up --

                    VINCENT (CONT'D)
          Don’t.

Sara freezes, peers up to find Vincent is only some 20 yards
away. She’s trapped. He stalks toward her, taking his time
freeing his magazine from his belt, loading it into his
weapon with an ominous CH-CHHUNK.
                                                           92.


                    VINCENT (CONT'D)
          So. That’s where you were all this
          time. Hiding in Tourteau’s barn.
              (sneers)
          He’ll have to answer for that.

Sara peers up at him, and somehow through her terror and
despair, her anger fights through and she finds her voice:

                     SARA
          His name is Julien... And he saved
          your life.

Vincent frowns, what the hell’s she talking about?

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          That day... at the cinema... you
          would have been shot dead if it
          wasn’t for him.

Vincent scoffs - he doesn’t believe her, nor does he care.

                    VINCENT
              (grimly)
          Get up.

Sara hesitates --

                    VINCENT (CONT'D)
          NOW!

She gets to her feet, glaring, scared but defiant.

                    VINCENT (CONT'D)
          Hands behind your head. Do it.

Sara raises her hands, puts them behind her head.

                     VINCENT (CONT'D)
          Turn around.
              (beat)
          I said TURN AROUND!

Sara stares back at him, realizes he’s going to shoot her.

                    SARA
          Coward.

She turns her back to him, and takes a steadying breath,
realizing she’s about to die.

She hears Vincent’s shallow breathing... the rustle of his
gun against his shirt... a short inhalation as he raises its
stock to shoot -- then another noise -- like a SNARL?
                                                             93.


VINCENT HEARS IT TOO. Surprised, his eyes dart to the sound --

-- glimpsing for only a split second the huge wolf to his
left! Vincent whips his gun toward the animal --

-- as the WOLF LUNGES, Vincent’s gunfire too wild and too
late as the wolf lands on him and sends him tumbling under
its weight, its ferocious jaws gnashing at him --

SARA BOLTS FOR COVER behind the nearest tree, unable to watch
as she hears the wolf mauling Vincent. Another quick burst
of gunfire, an injured HOWL from the animal... and then she
hears it limping away.

The Mernuit goes eerily still. Sara stays frozen a moment,
then braves a look. She can just make out Vincent’s body
lying in the wet leaves.

Sara pads closer, can now see Vincent has been fatally
mauled, gasping his dying breaths, eyes wide and unblinking.

Horrified, Sara is about to flee -- when she sees something
in the leaves where Vincent had first been knocked down:
Julien’s book bag?

Alarmed, she rushes to pick it up, finds her sketchbook
inside. All at once, she puts it together and knows the
worst has happened...

                    SARA (CONT'D)
          Julien!


EXT. FIELD - DAY

The world is almost eerily tranquil, grass rustling in the
breeze, the old stone barn visible in the distance... when
Sara comes racing into view, running as hard as she can.

She blows right past the barn, not thinking of her own
safety, not thinking of anything but Julien’s welfare --


EXT. STREET/ BEAUMIER'S MULTI-FAMILY HOME - DAY

Sara races along the same street she’s been observing for a
year now, the one Julien takes home from school each day...

Up ahead is the Beaumier’s home.    Sara rushes across the
street --

-- a CAR HORN BLARES as she’s nearly hit by a farm truck
hauling potatoes! Sara gasps, the DRIVER staring back at her
suspiciously through his windshield.
                                                           94.


Sara acts like she lives here, continues to the Beaumier’s.

She tries the door.   Locked.   She BANGS twice.   No answer.

She looks around -- spies a trellis along the side of the
building, and a window open just a crack on the second floor.

She makes for it, careful to act casual as she steals a look
back at the farmer’s truck, now idling down the street.


EXT. BEAUMIER’S MULTI-FAMILY HOME - SIDE OF THE BUILDING

Sara scales up the trellis, nearly losing her footing.    She
makes it to the window, forces it open --


INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

-- and slips inside. Silence. She peers around; she’s never
been in here before. Feeling something wet underfoot, she
realizes her cut-up bare feet are leaving bloody footprints.

                      SARA
          Vivienne?    Jean-Paul?


INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Sara searching.   The house appears empty.


INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Still no sign of the Beaumiers. Sara tries another door --
it’s locked. She tugs on it harder, but it won’t give.

She turns away, and then notices something on the wall: a
faded wedding photograph of a young couple we do not
recognize - definitely not Vivienne and Jean-Paul...?

                    OLD MAN (O.S.)
          Stay where you are.

Sara freezes, turning her head to see MONSIEUR LAFLEUR a few
feet away, an old shotgun in his frail hands trained on her.


INT. MILICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

A frantic-looking Jean-Paul and Vivienne stand breathless
before an impatient and evasive MILICE OFFICER.
                                                           95.


                    VIVIENNE
          Please -- we’re begging you --

                    MILICE OFFICER
          I just told you, there have been no
          arrests today.

                    JEAN-PAUL
          You’re lying!

The Officer glowers, starts to rise --

                    VIVIENNE
              (scared)
          Please -- we’re just upset...

Vivienne tugs Jean-Paul away. She peers around, helpless and
terrified, unsure where to turn --

                    YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
              (under his breath)
          Madame...

She glances up to find a young Officer staring furtively at
her: it’s Jerome, Vincent’s pal, his expression tinged with
guilt. He discreetly signals for them to follow him out --

BY THE ENTRANCE

Vivienne and Jean-Paul wait anxiously as Jerome joins them,
his voice hushed and weighted by conscience.

                    JEROME
          I know your son. He was taken this
          morning. I heard they put him on a
          transport truck to Aubervilliers
          along with some patients from the
          hospital...

Jean-Paul reaches for Vivienne as she chokes back a cry.

                    JEROME (CONT'D)
          You can still save him. I know the
          men who took him. For the right
          money, they can be bribed.


INT. BEAUMIER’S MULTI-FAMILY HOME - HALLWAY - DAY

Sara and Monsieur Lafleur as we left them, the old man
training his shotgun on a terrified Sara --

                    LAFLEUR
          Not another step or I’ll shoot.
                                                          96.


                        SARA
            Please...

-- when an old woman (MADAME LAFLEUR) steps into the hallway
behind her husband, looking almost as fearful as Sara.

                      M. LAFLEUR
            What are you doing here?

                      SARA
            I’m -- I’m a friend of Julien
            Beaumier.

                      MME. LAFLEUR
            What do you want with us?

                      SARA
            Nothing, I -- I need to find
            Vivienne.

Sara takes a step closer and Lafleur waves his gun.

                      MME. LAFLEUR
            Stay there!

               SARA                          M. LAFLEUR
  Please!                          Don’t make me shoot you!

                        ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
            Sara?

They all turn to find another OLD MAN (bearded, frailer)
emerging from the locked door, another OLD WOMAN behind him.
They’re dressed in overcoats. The woman carries a valise.

Sara looks shell-shocked, and then she recognizes him:

                      SARA
            ...Rabbi Bernstein?

                      M. LAFLEUR
            Bernstein, you know this girl?

                      MME. BERNSTEIN
            This is Sara Blum. Her family
            lived down the street from us.     Her
            father’s a surgeon --

                      SARA
            I - I don’t understand --

                      RABBI BERNSTEIN
            Lafleur, please - put the gun away.
                                                           97.


Lafleur lowers his gun, exchanging a wary look with his wife.

                    M. LAFLEUR
          We don’t have time for this. He’s
          waiting downstairs.
              (to Bernsteins)
          If you don’t leave now we may not
          get another chance.

                    RABBI BERNSTEIN
          Just a moment. Sara, what are you
          doing here?

                    SARA
          The Beaumiers have been hiding me
          in their barn.
              (to Lafleurs)
          They thought you were informants
          for the Nazis.

                    M. LAFLEUR
          Informants? We were afraid they
          might be.

                    RABBI BERNSTEIN
          Sara, the Lafleurs have been hiding
          us in their attic for almost two
          years now. Today we’re being
          smuggled out by the Armee Juive.

It starts to make sense to Sara; she’s reeling when Mme.
Bernstein approaches and wraps an arm around her.

                    MME. BERNSTEIN
          You should come with us.

                    SARA
          I can’t. I have to find Vivienne.
          Julien’s been arrested.

                     MME. LAFLEUR
          What?   That poor boy!

                    M. LAFLEUR
          That must be why she left in such a
          hurry this morning.

                    SARA
          What do you mean?

                    M. LAFLEUR
          Jean-Paul picked her up in a car
          and they sped away.
                                                         98.


Sara looks distraught.

                    M. LAFLEUR (CONT'D)
          Bernstein, if you have any hope of
          escaping, you need to go now.

                    MME. LAFLEUR
          We’ll look after the girl until the
          Beaumiers return.

                     RABBI BERNSTEIN
          Sara?   Are you sure you won’t come?

She shakes her head no.   The Bernsteins accept her choice.

                    M. LAFLEUR
          Good luck, old friend.

Bernstein turns to Lafleur and embraces him tightly.   The Old
Women do the same.

                     MME. LAFLEUR
          You’ll write us when you get to
          Jerusalem.

                    RABBI BERNSTEIN
          God will remember your kindness.

                    M. LAFLEUR
          Vive l’humanite.


INT. LAFLEUR HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

The Lafleurs stand at the same window from which we’d seen
them peering out before... watching as the Bernsteins are
helped into the back of the same farmer’s truck that nearly
ran Sara down. The Driver conceals them in potato sacks.

In a moment, the Driver is back in the cab and driving away.

                    M. LAFLEUR
          Bernstein and I served in the
          infantry together in the Great War.

The couple turn to Sara, now seated at their table, no less
distraught but helpless to do more than wait, busying herself
by washing the blood from her feet in a small basin.

                    M. LAFLEUR (CONT'D)
          He’s been like a brother to me.
                                                        99.


                     MME. LAFLEUR
          Sara, those gunshots we heard
          earlier...

                    SARA
          It was a Milice. The same one who
          had Julien arrested.
              (quieter)
          But he’s gone now.

Mme. Lafleur senses Sara’s trauma, about to ask her more --

                    M. LAURENT
              (peering out again)
          It’s Vivienne!

Sara leaps to her feet, races to the window...

ACROSS THE STREET she can see Vivienne running for the barn.
Sara tugs open the window --

                      SARA
          Vivienne!

Vivienne halts, takes her a second to realize where Sara’s
shouting from. She’s stunned to find Sara standing in the
Lafleur’s window, the old couple on either side of her.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. LAFLEUR HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

Vivienne looks utterly devastated as we finishes explaining
to Sara and the Lafleurs:

                    VIVIENNE
          Jean-Paul went to ask his foreman
          to loan him the money for a bribe.
          I ran back here to check on Sara.
              (squeezes Sara’s hand)
          Thank God you’re safe.

The old couple share a quick look.

                    M. LAFLEUR
          How much money do you need?

                    VIVIENNE
          Much more than we have.

Mme. Lafleur springs to her feet.

                    MME. LAFLEUR
          With this we can help.
                                                        100.


She reaches into a cupboard, takes down a tin box.   She opens
the lid, revealing a wad of bills.

Vivienne’s eyes well, overwhelmed with gratitude.

                     M. LAFLEUR
           We’ll take my car.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Vivienne hurries into the passenger seat of Lafleur’s old
Citroën as he starts it. In a moment they’re speeding away...


INT. LAFLEUR HOME - ATTIC - DAY

Sara stands at a window, anxiously watching the old Citroën
disappear from view. The street is unsettlingly quiet again.

The only sound is Sara’s breathing as she stares out,
stricken. We see Mme Lafleur outside picking up the
motorcycle and rolling in into the barn.

Sara finally steps away from the window. Peers around this
small space where the Bernsteins were hiding for two years.


EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

A military truck climbs a steep and snaking road.

UP AHEAD

we see a MILITARY BLOCKADE coming into view.

As the truck nears, the Nazi soldiers stationed there step
forward with weapons ready, halting the truck.

The MILICE DRIVER rolls his window down.

                     BLOCKADE COMMANDER
           Road’s closed by order of the SS.

                     MILICE DRIVER
           Our orders are to transport these
           men to Aubervilliers.

The Blockade Commander eyes the driver irritably.

                     BLOCKADE COMMANDER
           What idiot ordered that? The
           prison in Aubervilliers is too
           crowded as it is!
                                                       101.


                    MILICE DRIVER
          Sir, they were taken from the
          hospital in Dannevilliers.
              (confides)
          Most are from the loony bin.

                    BLOCKADE COMMANDER
          The hospital?

                    MILICE DRIVER
          To make room for wounded Germans.

The Blockade Commander frowns.

                       BLOCKADE COMMANDER
          Wait here.

Through the windshield the Driver observes the Commander
march back to his men, orders one to hand him a radio...


INT. MILITARY TRUCK - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS

We find a collection of HOSPITAL PATIENTS, almost twenty in
all, crammed in here. Some appear mentally ill; others are
visibly infirm. Among them we find Julien, looking scared.

                    NERVOUS PATIENT
          I don’t like this. Why are we
          stopping?

                       OLDER PATIENT
          You there.     Boy.

Julien glances up.

                    OLDER PATIENT (CONT'D)
          You all right?

Julien hesitates, then shakes his head no. The Older Patient
regards him kindly, about to say something of comfort --

-- when the panel doors are pulled open, and harsh daylight
spills in. The German Commander is standing there, two of
his TROOPS beside him, as well as the truck’s Driver.

                    GERMAN COMMANDER
          Okay, everybody out.

                    OLDER PATIENT
          What’s going on?
                                                         102.


                    BANDAGED PATIENT
          We were told we were being
          transferred to Aubervilliers.

                    GERMAN COMMANDER
          You are, but this road is closed,
          so you’re being diverted. Best to
          take a bathroom break now.

Julien tenses as he sees their Milice Driver drop his eyes
guiltily. He realizes they’re being lied to --

                      GERMAN TROOP
          Let’s go.    Out! Move it!

Julien looks to the Older Patient, who appears gravely
worried as well.

The first of the prisoners nevertheless begin to climb out.
Julien has no choice but to follow, using only his one
remaining crutch to walk.


INT. LAFLEUR HOME - ATTIC - DAY

Sara as we left her; terrified for Julien... when she sees
something at the little window that surprises her...

THE WHITE BIRD. It’s flying over her barn, just visible in
the distance. The sight of it brings a worried, sad smile to
her face. As if its mere presence gives her some hope...

Staring out at the bird soaring farther away, she’s moved to
quietly sing, her voice trembling, almost like a prayer:

                    SARA
          Little bird, little bird,
          How high will you fly?
          As high as the sky,
          As the sky above...


EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - CONTINUOUS

The Guards wait for the last of the Prisoners to dismount.
Julien can see the other German Guards by the blockade eyeing
them disdainfully; one of them smirks.

Julien glances back at their Milice Driver, who still refuses
to look at them...?

                    OLDER PATIENT (O.S.)
              (a harrowed whisper)
          They’re going to shoot us.
                                                          103.


Julien turns to him, alarmed.

                    GERMAN COMMANDER
          To the woods! All of you!

The group begins to pace fearfully toward the woods ahead.


EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

The Prisoners now marching between the trees, trailed by the
Commander and his two Troops.

A few of the prisoners are starting to cry, aware of their
fates. Others steal terrified glances back at the officers.

A BEARDED PATIENT looks determined, however; he sneaks a low
whisper to the Patient beside him:

                    BEARDED PATIENT
          There’s nineteen of us and three of
          them. If we all run at once, some
          of us would have a chance.

The other PATIENT considers this, then nods grimly.

                    BEARDED PATIENT (CONT'D)
          Tell the others. On my say.

The Patient inconspicuously slows a beat, then whispers
inaudibly to the man beside him.

                    BLOCKADE GUARD
          No talking!

But as the group continues deeper into the woods, we see that
word is slowly managing to spread among the prisoners.

Word reaches the Older Patient, who glances uneasily at
Julien hobbling on one crutch. A beat, then he whispers:

                    OLDER PATIENT
          How fast can you run like that?

Julien peers back at him...


EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

The Lafleurs’ car comes racing up the winding road. The
remaining Guards at the roadblock hurry out to stop them.

The passenger door opens and Vivienne leaps out.
                                                          104.


                       VIVIENNE
            Please!   My son is in that truck!

                      BORDER GUARD
            Not anymore. They continued on
            foot.

Vivienne sees the Driver eyeing her as he smokes, and
instantly she knows what this means. Gripped by terror:

                      VIVIENNE
            No, no please -- I have money --

She desperately waves a fistful of bills at the Guards.

                      VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
            Money for his release! Please!

The Guards exchange wary glances. One of them nods to
another, who reaches out and takes her money.

                         GUARD
            Follow me.

She gasps relief, quickly follows the Guard toward the trees.


EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

The Prisoners even deeper in the woods now. The Guards
exchanging looks, their hands tighter on their gun stocks.

                      GERMAN COMMANDER
            Walk to that thicket up ahead.   You
            can do your business there.

ON JULIEN

His gaze shifting from his captors to his fellow prisoners,
all of whom are staring dead ahead now, feigning obedience.

Julien looks breathless, struggling on his crutch as he sees
the Bearded Prisoner steal a furtive look to the others.

It’s nearly time. Julien cranes his neck as if to take one
last look at the trees and the clear blue sky... when the
most unexpected thing happens. He cracks a small smile.
Follow his gaze up to see --

A WHITE BIRD flying overhead.
                                                       105.


INT. LAFLUER HOME - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Sara as she was, singing very quietly to herself:

                    SARA
          Little bird, little bird...

                    SARA/JULIEN (V.O.)
          How fast will you go?


EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Watching the white bird soar over, Julien is somehow moved to
quietly sing under his breath a snippet of the song as well.

                    JULIEN/ SARA (V.O.)
          As fast as a crow,
          As fast as a dove...

The air is charged as the group enters the thicket; we can
feel the prisoners about to make their run for it --

                    OLDER PATIENT
              (whispers)
          Good luck, boy.


EXT. WOODS (FARTHER BACK) - CONTINUOUS

Vivienne running, desperate to catch them in time, the Border
Guard annoyed at having to keep up with her...


EXT. WOODS - THICKET - CONTINUOUS

The Prisoners in the midst of the thicket, Julien seems
mysteriously calmer now, as if the presence of the white bird
above has reminded him of Sara...

                    BEARDED PRISONER
          NOW!

The Germans look shocked as the Prisoners suddenly make a run
for it en masse, bolting into the trees in all directions!

The Commander barks an order and the Guards open fire on the
escapees in a punishing barrage of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE --


EXT. WOODS (FARTHER BACK) - CONTINUOUS

Jolted by the sudden GUNSHOTS echoing from up ahead, Vivienne
goes white as a sheet, eyes wide in terror --
                                                       106.


                     VIVIENNE
           NOOOOOOO!!!


INT. LAFLUER HOME - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

As if reacting subconsciously, tears begin to flow down
Sara’s cheeks as she keeps softly singing through her fear:

                     SARA
           Little bird, little bird...


EXT. WOODS - THICKET - CONTINUOUS

Julien running as fast as his legs allow, forcing himself to
fight through their limitations as GUNFIRE RAGES around him.

The Older Patient falls dead up ahead.

PUSHING TIGHTER ON JULIEN’S FACE

He’s willing himself to run harder... to flee... and now the
GUNFIRE FADES TO SILENCE in his ears, until the only sound we
hear is his labored breathing -- and:

                     SARA (V.O.)
               (singing softly)
           How far will you see?

Bullets shred a tree trunk to his right, but he ignores it,
just keeps running as hard as he possibly can...

                     SARA (V.O.)
           As far as I wish...

A glimmer of hope in Julien’s eyes, almost as if he can hear
her singing. Transcendence seems just within reach...

                     SARA (V.O.)
           For now I am fr--

BANG!   A sudden, single GUNSHOT RINGS OUT.

Julien falls out of frame as the world goes totally SILENT.


INT. WOODS (FARTHER BACK) - CONTINUOUS

TOTAL AND UTTER SILENCE as we see Vivienne collapsing to the
forest floor, screaming noiselessly...
                                                          107.


INT. LAFLUER HOME - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

TOTAL AND UTTER SILENCE as Sara slumps against a wall, sits
and hugs her knees to her chest, nothing more to do but wait.

She stays like this.   Waiting... Waiting... Waiting...

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          They never found Julien’s body.


EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - LATE DAY

Monsieur Lafleur looks stricken as he struggles to help a
hysterical Vivienne back into his car, the Nazis shouting
angrily at her, their guns waving.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          The Nazis did not let Vivienne get
          any closer. In fact, they quickly
          denied a shooting had even taken
          place.


EXT. BEAUMIER'S MULTI-FAMILY HOME - TWILIGHT

Lafluer’s car rumbles into view.    Slows to a halt.


INT. LAFLEUR HOME - ATTIC - NIGHT

The sound of a door being unlocked, then opened... to reveal
Sara pacing in the center of the room. She looks up. The
moment she sees Vivienne and Jean-Paul’s devastated
expressions in the doorway, she goes stock still.

The Beaumiers slowly approach Sara, Vivienne cradling her in
her arms as Sara begins to sob uncontrollably.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          The Beaumiers held on to the hope
          that perhaps somehow Julien had
          escaped, but they knew better.


INT. BEAUMIER’S HOME - JULIEN’S ROOM - DAY

Sara moves through Julien’s room, cherishing every object he
left behind. His whittling knife, his Edison biography. But
it’s the Charlie Chaplin lobby card that brings her to tears.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          Somehow they put aside their
          immeasurable sorrow to take care of
                    (MORE)
                                                        108.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (CONT'D)
          me. I stayed with them through the
          end of the war. Hidden, of course.


INT. BEAUMIER’S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

Vivienne, Jean-Paul and Sara listen intently to the radio.

                    RADIO ANNOUNCER
          Allied troops have gathered at the
          Arc de Triomphe, to the cheers of a
          grateful Paris. General De Gaulle
          announced that he will move his
          headquarters into the War Ministry,
          and has requested the assistance of
          the American infantry in
          maintaining order in the city...

Jean-Paul wraps an arm around Vivienne. Sara can see that
even in their joy there is immeasurable sadness.


EXT. AUBERVILLIERS AUX BOIS - STREETS - LATE DAY

Celebrations in the crowded streets. From the oldest to the
youngest, people hug each other, laugh and cry.

For the first time in almost two years, Sara walks among
them, the Beaumiers behind her; she no longer needs to hide,
yet there’s a timidity in her movements, a lingering distrust
and a deep loneliness even amongst the revelers.

She spies familiar faces like Madame Ballou’s. Sara looks
conflicted, but has been through too much to begrudge anyone.
And then she sees something up ahead, and slows.

                    VIVIENNE
          Sara?

                    SARA
          I’ll be right back.


EXT. BLUM FAMILY FLAT - LATE DAY

Sara arrives at the steps of her old building.   Peers up.


INT. BLUM FAMILY FLAT - LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY

Sara enters her family’s home... to find it was ransacked
long ago. Nothing of monetary value remains; the windows are
cracked, and a layer of dust coats every surface.
                                                        109.


Sara looks sorrowful but unsurprised. She moves through the
rooms, taking it all in -- then pauses, a flicker of relief
to find an old photo album tossed in a corner.

She carefully picks it up, flips through the pages of photos.
Tears flood her eyes as she stares at herself at age
thirteen, beaming between her two loving parents.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          When the war was finally over, it
          was expected that life would return
          to normal. And I suppose for some,
          it may have.


EXT. BEAUMIER'S MULTI-FAMILY HOME - MORNING

Vivienne hugs Sara goodbye as she departs with her book bag.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          I continued to live with the
          Beaumiers, who’d become like
          family.


EXT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - COURTYARD - DAY

Sara approaches uncertainly, feeling exposed.   It all feels a
little unreal.

She’s spotted by Mariann and Sophie, who seem equally
uncertain how to act. They smile nervously, slowly approach
her. Sara manages to smile back as they arrive before her.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          I was glad to be back at school,
          but everything felt different now.


INT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - CLASSROOM - DAY

At least 1/4 of the desks are empty.   Sara looks distracted
as Pastor Robert teaches his class.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          The weeks passed in a fog. Try as
          I might, I couldn’t stop thinking
          about all that had happened to me.
          And to Julien.

Her gaze lingers on the empty desk in the spot where Julien
always used to sit.
                                                        110.


                    GRAND-MÈRE
          Then one day, in early November...


EXT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - COURTYARD - DAY

Kids filing out of school, bundled in coats. Sara chatting
with Mariann and Sophie, feigning a good mood as she listens
to Sophie gossip about some boy she likes -- when Sara stops
dead in her tracks, staring ahead in utter amazement...

REVERSE ON THE FRONT GATE

There, standing before her, is her father. Max’s hair is
grayer now, he looks thinner, but the smile on his face tells
us whatever he’s suffered has been worth it to find her.

Sara rushes to him, overcome with joy, leaping into his arms
as they embrace tightly, both of them tearful.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          It was Papa. He was back!


EXT. ECOLE LAFAYETTE - SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

Sara and Max sit on a bench, Max filling her in, unable to
stop himself from hugging her every other minute.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          He said that he was still looking
          for Maman, that he and another
          doctor had evaded the round up by
          hiding in the morgue.

                    MAX
          ...I finally made it to the Mernuit
          and joined the Maquis for a time.
          They smuggled me across the border
          into Switzerland...


INT. BEAUMIER’S HOME - KITCHEN - EVENING

Sara and Max talking with Vivienne and Jean-Paul, Max
thanking them profusely.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          I introduced him to the Beaumiers,
          who he could not stop thanking.

As Vivienne speaks, Sara can’t help but notice a look on her
father’s face, an effort to conceal a profound sadness.
                                                       111.


INT. BEAUMIER’S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Max sits on the edge of Sara’s bed, gripped by emotion as he
lowers his head and starts to explain something:

                    GRAND-MERE (V.O.)
          That night, Papa took me aside.

                    MAX
          Sara... there’s something I need to
          tell you...

                    GRAND-MERE (V.O.)
          Somehow I knew it was about Maman.
          He had tried to keep the truth from
          me, but realized that he could not.


EXT. AUBERVILLIERS-AUX-BOIS - OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY

Rose is buying some vegetables from a stall, when she notices
TWO GENDARMES checking a list. She swallows, terrified...

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          He explained that on the day of the
          round up, Maman had been arrested.

One of the Gendarmes looks up and his eyes meet Rose’s --
Rose suddenly drops her groceries and makes a run for it, the
Gendarmes chasing after, shoving people out of their way.


EXT. AUSCHWITZ CAMP - ARRIVAL PLATFORM - DAY

A Reichsbahn consisting of freight and cattle cars grinds to
a halt. HUNDREDS OF JEWISH MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN are
herded off the train, yellow stars sewn to their clothes.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          She was put on a train to Drancy,
          and from there sent to the
          concentration camp in Auschwitz.


EXT. AUSCHWITZ CAMP - DAY

The prisoners look around fearfully, clocking the sinister
barbed wire, the forbidding rows of barracks. Among these
faces, we find Rose, peering around her, utterly forlorn.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          He didn’t know how long she was
          kept a prisoner there.
                                                          112.


TIGHT ON ROSE’S FACE

as she takes a last glance behind her, toward us --

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          Only that that is where she died.


EXT. BEAUMIER’S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sara visible in the window, weeping in her father’s arms.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          I cried all that night, and for
          many days that followed.


EXT. DANNEVILLIERS - TRAIN STATION - DAY

The Beaumiers hug Sara tightly, Max standing beside them,
gripping two suitcases.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          Papa and I stayed with the
          Beaumiers for a short while, until
          he found work at a hospital in
          Paris, the city that would become
          my new home.

Vivienne fights back tears as she kisses Sara’s cheeks.

                    SARA
          I’m going to miss you.

                    VIVIENNE
          You will always have a mother in
          me, cherie. I love you.


EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY

Vivienne and Jean-Paul wave to Sara and Max as they depart.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          I came back to visit the Beaumiers
          often, even as a grown woman.


INT. PARISIAN SYNAGOGUE - DAY

A beautiful SARA (AGE 25) stands with Max on her right, and
Vivienne and Jean-Paul on her left, as the three of them walk
her down the aisle.
                                                       113.


                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          And when I married your
          grandfather, they, along with my
          Papa, walked me down the aisle.


INT. DANNEVILLIERS OUTSKIRTS - DAY

SARA (AGE 40) walks along the same road she once walked with
Julien, only beside her now is her 14 year old DAUGHTER and 9
year old SON.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          You forget many things in life, but
          you never forget kindness.


EXT. DANNEVILLIERS - CEMETERY - DAY

Sara lays flowers beside a grave that reads: “ICI REPOSENT
VIVIENNE BEAUMIER ET JEAN-PAUL BEAUMIER, MERE ET PERE DE
JULIEN AUGUSTE BEAUMIER.”

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          Like love, it stays with you
          forever.

Sara smiles poignantly, taking each of her children’s hands.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (V.O.)
          And I suppose that, mon cher...


INT. ALBANS' APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Grand-Mère’s smile identical at age 95.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          ...is the end of my story.

Julian peers back at her, in awe of all she’s been through.
Moved in a way that is likely quite unusual for him.

                    GRAND-MÈRE (CONT'D)
          Did I upset you?

                    JULIAN
          Yes, but - in a good way.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          And do you understand why I needed
          to tell you now? Julian?
                                                        114.


Julian nods, gripped by a flood of conflicted emotions.
Grand-Mère rises, crosses to him -- and he hugs her tight.

She pats his back, proud of his response.   O.S. we can hear
the sound of the front door opening.

                      GRAND-MÈRE (CONT'D)
          Ah!    Your parents are home.

She rises, starts to clear the dishes.

                    JULIAN
          It’s okay, I’ve got them.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          Merci, mon cher.

She squeezes his hand, then exits the dining room; in a
moment we hear her entering the foyer, greeting her son and
daughter-in-law, asking how their “soiree” was.

Julian picks up the dishes, about to carry them into the
kitchen, when his eye lands on something...

ONE OF A FEW OLD FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS on the far wall. He sets
the dishes back down and approaches... There, in faded black
and white, is that photo of 13-year-old Sara with her smiling
parents that we’d seen in the album she recovered from her
family’s ransacked home.

Julian stares, moved by the girl his age smiling back at him
in the photo, unaware of all that life has in store for her.


EXT. YATES ACADEMY - MORNING

Students filing in to school...


INT. YATES ACADEMY - HALLWAY - DAY

We find Julien in his uniform, walking past the lockers,
ignored by some, snickered at by others. But he seems less
bothered by the stares now; instead searching the crowded
hall -- until he sees who he’s looking for...

CAROLINE, the girl we met at the start of our film. She’s
standing at a folding table with two other kids, a hand-drawn
“RALLY FOR IMMIGRANT RIGHTS IN BRYANT PARK THIS SATURDAY!”
poster taped between the table legs.

                     JULIAN (O.S.)
          Hey.
                                                        115.


Caroline glances up, surprised to see Julian here.

                    JULIAN (CONT'D)
          I don’t know if it’s too late to
          sign up or--

                   CAROLINE
          Yes! I mean, no -- it’s not too
          late! Definitely not. Here!

She hands him a sign-up sheet.   Only a handful of names.

                    CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          This is Sean and Jessie.

                    JULIAN
          Julian.

SEAN and JESSIE return muted but welcoming hellos. Julian
glances down at the rally flyers, and a phrase catches his
eye: “SPECIAL GUEST SPEAKERS!” Caroline notices, cringes:

                    CAROLINE
          Yeah, that’s - something we’re
          still working on.

Julien considers this a beat, then has an inspired idea:

                    JULIAN
          Maybe I can help with that.

The three kids look back at him, puzzled...

                    CAROLINE (PRE-LAP)
          You know her for her incredibly
          influential body of work...


EXT. BRYANT PARK - EVENT/ STAGE/ PODIUM - DAY

THOUSANDS OF ATTENDEES, mostly TEENS, fill the great lawn,
many holding signs that read “NO WALLS, NO BANS!” “KEEP
FAMILIES TOGETHER,” etc.

                    CAROLINE (OVER P.A.)
          ...which can be found in museums
          from here to the Louvre...

AT THE PODIUM

We find Caroline addressing the huge crowd.
                                                       116.


                    CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          But today, she’s here to speak
          about her experience as a Holocaust
          survivor, and tell us about the
          pain and hope that has shaped her
          life. Please join me in welcoming,
          the one and only... Sara Blum!

The crowd erupts in cheers and applause as Grand-Mère makes
her way to the podium. She quietly thanks Caroline, then
continues to the microphone as the crowd’s cheering swells.

AT THE SIDE OF THE STAGE

We find Julian in an event t-shirt, beaming proudly up at
her, surrounded by some potential new friends.

BACK TO GRAND-MÈRE

As she continues for the podium, we now see she is squeezing
something in her hand, like a talisman: it’s the small carved
bird that Julien made for her birthday all those years ago.

She glances down at it, then sets it down on the podium and
peers out at the sea of young faces before her.

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          Bonjour, mes amis jeunes.

A renewed burst of applause and cheers. Grand-Mère looks
momentarily overcome. She stares out across their hopeful
faces, waving at her, cheering up at her...

...when she catches her breath.

There, in their midst, is Julien Beaumier, age 15, looking
just as he did the last night Sara saw him. He smiles back
at her. Proud of her.

Fortified, Grand-Mère returns an emotional smile, and begins:

                    GRAND-MÈRE (CONT'D)
          I want to thank my grandson for
          inviting me today... and to thank
          you all for speaking out. Because
          when we see inhumanity, we must
          speak out. It is the only way to
          be sure that what happened to me,
          and millions like me, will never
          happen again... Let me hear you say
          it: Never again!

                    CROWD
          Never again!
                                                       117.


                    GRAND-MÈRE
          Louder, so the whole world can hear
          us... Never again!

                    CROWD
          NEVER AGAIN!

                    GRAND-MÈRE
          Never again!

                    CROWD
          NEVER AGAIN!!

The crowd erupts as we soar up and over this inspiring sea of
young people... to whom Grand-Mère now begins to tell her
story, the sound fading as we soar higher...

Higher over the park... higher... until we’re looking at the
city’s skyline, the sun shining brightly, the sky a glorious
blue... when A WHITE BIRD enters frame.

We follow it on its journey toward the horizon, the city
receding in the distance, the Statue of Liberty like a beacon
far below. The white bird spreads its wings, and soars
higher... higher... higher...

                                                FADE OUT.



                            The End
