OVER BLACK:

The first notes of Sweet Thing by Van Morrison. Warm, gentle,
easy.

                                                FADE IN TO:

SUMMER CAMP in the CATSKILLS. Sunlit. Glorious. Ten thousand
shades of green.

                   The year is 1970.

It could be any year. Summer camp might be the only thing
that never changes.

OPENING CREDITS begin to appear and disappear as we find...

MARGARET SIMON (11), standing on a DOCK in her BATHING SUIT,
spindly arms and legs, nose peeling from a sunburn, hair
swept up in a jumble of bobby pins, growing out from a bob.

She lets out a GOOFY REBEL-YELL and   does a AWKWARD JUMP into
the LAKE, arms and legs flailing. A   DOZEN 11-YEAR-OLD GIRLS
do their own funny lake-jumps after   her, one after another,
like dominos. They all come up from   the water, LAUGHING.

A COLLAGE OF IMAGES: The girls singing CAMP SONGS, firing and
misfiring ARROWS, clopping through a stream ON HORSEBACK,
whispering in BUNK BEDS, blowing out MARSHMALLOWS by a
CAMPFIRE, all squeezed together with their arms around each
other by a “CAMP EAGLE LAKE” SIGN.

A BRIGHT LIGHT FLASHES, capturing a PHOTO of it. All of the
girls grinning, carefree, unaware yet of their bodies, their
crooked teeth, the dorky haircuts they’ll soon regret. KIDS.

They break apart. Margaret and the other campers HUG and do
stupid handshakes goodbye.

She climbs aboard the NEW YORK-BOUND CAMP BUS among a LINE OF
BUSES here to shuttle all the girls back to the cities they
came from.


INT./EXT. SCHOOL BUS - SAME

Margaret looks out the bus window at bucolic New Hampshire,
saying goodbye to the best summer of her life.


EXT. NEW YORK CITY - AFTERNOON

A labyrinth of STEAL AND CONCRETE, swarming with people.
                                                         2.


Margaret’s BUS lumbers through traffic, making a wide slow
turn towards UNION SQUARE, packed with WAITING PARENTS.


EXT. UNION SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

Margaret gives more goodbye-hugs as she makes her way out of
the bus, scans the sea of faces for her mom.

BARBARA SIMON (30’s) -- hair frizzed from the heat, anxious
to please, polite to a fault -- weaves through the crowd,
brightening as she spots Margaret. She waves both hands, her
fingers stained with paint, a wrist coil key chain jammed
with too many keys.

Margaret runs over, HUGGING her. Barbara squeezes her hard.

                      MARGARET
          Mom!

                    BARBARA
          Heyyy! You already got taller! How
          was it?

                    MARGARET
          So good. I almost didn’t want to
          leave.

                    BARBARA
          Good! Come on, let’s get your
          trunk, I double-parked the car,
          they’re already mad at me.

                      MARGARET
          What car?

                    BARBARA
          Oh, we bought a car.

They pull Margaret’s CAMP TRUNK out of the BUS’S CARGO HOLD.

                    MARGARET
          We bought a car? What for?

                    BARBARA
          I’ll explain later. Right over
          there, that blue one.

They awkwardly schlep the trunk over to the Simon’s new
CHRYSLER NEWPORT, a humongous land-yacht idling in the road.

Margaret’s Grandma, SYLVIA SIMON (60’s), coiffed red hair, a
vibrant dominating force, the kind of woman to keep on your
good side, climbs out of the passenger seat.
                                                            3.


                     MARGARET
          Grandma!

                    SYLVIA
          There’s my girl!

Margaret drops the trunk, runs to hug her. Barb watches their
love-fest, dragging the trunk the rest of the way herself.

                    SYLVIA (CONT'D)
          Oh god I missed you.

                    MARGARET
          Me too! You changed your hair
          color?

                    SYLVIA
          Several times. Here, welcome home
          gift. Read the label. Aloud.

Margaret reaches inside a GIFT BAG, pulls out A HAND-KNIT
SWEATER, reads the LABEL.

                    MARGARET
          “Handmade expressly for you by
          Grandma.” Ah, you made this?

                    SYLVIA
          From scratch. Cashmere. I did
          everything but kill the goat.
          Anyway, tell me all about camp! Did
          you have the best time? Did you
          meet a new boyfriend?!

                     MARGARET
                (embarrassed)
          Grandma...

                    SYLVIA
          Don’t worry, you’ll be swimming in
          boys soon. And let’s hope they’re
          Jewish!

Barb is hurrying to find the key to the hatch on her massive
wrist coil when she overhears this, looks up at Sylvia: WTF?

                    SYLVIA (CONT'D)
          Never mind, I take it back! Your
          boyfriend can be anything. Anything
          at all.

She gives Margaret a secret look: But between you and me:
Jewish.
                                                           4.


A CAR HONKS behind them, TRAFFIC stacking up.

                    GUY IN CAR
          Let’s go lady, you can’t just stop
          in the road!!!

                    BARBARA
          Going! We’re going!

Margaret rushes to help Barb hoist the luggage in the trunk.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Sorry! It’s our first car, we just
          bought it last week!

                     GUY IN CAR
                    (softens)
          Oh, is that right? Congratulations!
              (then lays on horn LOUDER)


INT. SIMONS’ WALK-UP APARTMENT BUILDING - A LITTLE LATER

Margaret, Barb, and Sylvia carry the camp trunk up a FLIGHT
OF STAIRS, each holding a corner, sweating.

                    SYLVIA
          How many more steps? What the
          heck’s in here? Sand?

                     MARGARET
              (switches places with her)
          It’s ‘cause you’re at the bottom.
          Here.

                    BARBARA
          Hold on, I gotta find the key.

Barb strains to hold her end with one hand, searching through
her big wad of keys again with the free hand. Sylvia rolls
her eyes, knowing this will take a while.

                    SYLVIA
          Oh god, not with those keys again.


INT. SIMONS’ APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Tiny, hodge-podge, lovingly cluttered, Barb’s CANVASES and
ART SUPPLIES stacked around in piles.
                                                           5.


IN THE BEDROOM, HERB SIMON (30’s), natural born salesman,
can’t go anywhere without making 50 new friends -- changes
out of his suit from work, bouncing in his socks to the beat
of I Wonder Why by Dion and The Belmonts.

He hears the FRONT DOOR swing open, and heads into THE LIVING
ROOM, sees the women lumber in and drop the trunk, out of
breath. He rushes over, feeling guilty.

                    HERB
          Why didn’t you come get me for
          this?! Heyyyy, welcome back,
          Honeybunch!

He gives Margaret a hug, says hello to Barb and his mom.

                    HERB (CONT'D)
          How was it? It sounded like so much
          fun in your letters, you were even
          in the play!

                     MARGARET
          They needed a boy and I could do
              (deep voice)
          the deeeeepest vooooice.

                     HERB
              (deep voice back)
          Oh! Who are you, sir? What have you
          done with my little girl?

                     MARGARET
                  (deep voice)
          It’s still meeeee. This is acting.

They both laugh.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          What are those boxes for?

She points to SOME CARDBOARD BOXES stacked up in the corner.

                    HERB
          We’ll get to that in a sec, let’s
          hear more about camp!

                    SYLVIA
          You’re moving.

Margaret FREEZES. Looks at Sylvia. What?

Barb and Herb exchange a look, can’t believe it.
                                                           6.


                       HERB
          Mom.

                       BARBARA
          Oh my god.

                    SYLVIA
          What, she saw the boxes, she was
          putting it together.

Margaret tries to catch up, hoping she’s hearing this wrong.

                    MARGARET
          What! We’re moving?

Barbara scrambles to soften the blow.

                    BARBARA
          Listen, we wanted you to settle in
          before we sprung the news, but dad
          got his promotion and we found this
          great house--

                    HERB
          Great. Much bigger than this one,
          with grass and trees and kids your
          age--

Margaret is still disoriented, barely hearing them.

                       MARGARET
          Where?

                    BARBARA
          Well that’s the thing, we got lucky
          and you know how we always--

                     SYLVIA
              (cuts to chase)
          New Jersey.

Margaret’s eyes bug out of her head. Barb and Herb can’t
believe Sylvia did it again.

                       HERB
          Mom!

                    MARGARET
          New Jersey?!

Sylvia puts her hands up, guilty.
                                                            7.


                     SYLVIA
          I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I’m sitting
          over here!

She puts herself in a TIME-OUT across the room.

Margaret begins to spiral, retreats to a chair, trying to
process this. Barb struggles to regain control of things.

                    MARGARET
          We’re leaving New York?

                    BARBARA
          Okay, hold on a second--

                    MARGARET
          But why? We’re happy here, we don’t
          need to move.

                    HERB
          We don’t need to, we want to.

                    MARGARET
          I don’t. I’ll have to change
          schools, and leave all my friends,
          I won’t see Grandma anymore...

Sylvia helplessly mimes her commiseration.

                    BARBARA
          That’s not true, you’ll make new
          friends, the schools are great, and
          Grandma will come visit us, won’t
          you Sylvia?

Barb looks to her mother-in-law for help.

                    SYLVIA
          I said I’d stay out of it. But I
          don’t drive...

Barbara gives up, kneels down in front of Margaret, trying to
get through. Really talk to her.

                    BARBARA
          Look, Margaret, I know. It’s a big
          thing to digest, but believe me, I
          swear to you, it’s gonna be good.
          We’ll have a real house, more
          space, our own backyard. And listen
          to this:

She takes Margaret’s hands in hers, earnest, trying to convey
what’s really at the heart of this.
                                                            8.


                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          I’m not gonna work anymore. Do you
          know what that means? That means I
          won’t be gone all the time, running
          to a different class every night.
          God, you know how bad I’ve felt
          about that?

We can see just how bad Barb’s felt. Working mother’s guilt
oozing from her.

                    MARGARET
          But you like teaching art.

                    BARBARA
          Yeah but so what, this our
          opportunity, I can stay home now.
          I’ll be home everyday with you,
          we’ll have family dinners, I’ll
          learn to cook, get involved at your
          school...like your friends’ moms...

Barbara feels herself get a little emotional at the prospect
of finally being the kind of mother she’s seen on TV.

                    HERBS
          We promise you, Margaret. This is
          good. Things are only going to get
          better.

                    BARBARA
          Just try to believe us, okay? Can
          you just try?

Margaret manages a nod. No other choice. Barbara draws her in
for a hug. Herb joins. They embrace in a little clump. Barb
looks over at Sylvia, still in time-out across the room.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Come on. Come over here, Sylvia.

Sylvia heads over, joining their hug. It’s a sweet moment.

                     SYLVIA
          Aww honey...
              (pats Margaret, emotional)
          I’m never gonna see you again.

                    HERB
          Oh good lord!

Their HUG BREAKS APART. We stay on Margaret’s face as the
adults go at it again.
                                                            9.


EXT. NYC   - NIGHT

It’s late now, the New York skyline twinkling yellow, the
streets a relative quiet.


EXT. SIMONS’ APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME

We take Margaret in from outside her window. She stands near
the glass, uneasy, looking out at the city she’s leaving.


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - SAME

She peers around her room, the knot in her stomach
tightening, her eyes starting to fill up.

                     MARGARET
           Oh god... are you there God? If you
           are, it’s me, Margaret... I just
           want to say... well... first, I’ve
           heard a lot good things about
           you... Uh, so, I could use some
           help? Please, God, I don’t wanna
           move, I’ve never lived anywhere but
           the city, New Jersey is...I mean,
           look, I’m sure you’ve heard what
           people say about it, nobody’s ever
           prayed “God let me live someplace
           great like Hoboken!” I’m just...I’m
           begging you. Please just stop this
           move from happening.

She looks over at the HANDFUL OF BOXES that have already been
packed for her.

                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
           And if you can’t do that... just
           somehow... make things turn out
           okay?

She lets out a deep exhale, desperately hoping somebody heard
this prayer.


EXT. SIMONS’ APARTMENT BUILDING / STREET CORNER - MORNING

The CHRYSLER is packed up, idling at the curb. Sylvia and
Margaret hug each other goodbye, both gutted about this.

                     SYLVIA
           I’ll call you everyday after
           school. 3:30 everyday, okay?
                                                           10.


Margaret nods somberly. Herb puts his arm around Sylvia,
squeezing her goodbye.

                    HERB
          We’ll call you when we get there,
          mom.

                     BARBARA
              (hugging her)
          Bye, Sylvia.

                    SYLVIA
          You could’ve just said “you’re
          dropping in too much, cut it out,”
          you didn’t have move.

                    BARBARA
          This isn’t about you, I promise.

Sylvia doesn’t quite believe it.

                    HERB
          Alright, all board the Big Blue
          Beast!

They pile into the car. Herb looks back at his mother
standing alone on the curb, forlorn. Feels badly. He walks
over to give her one more hug.

                    HERB (CONT'D)
          It’s only an hour by train, mom.

                    SYLVIA
          Yeah, just long enough to pick up a
          family of bedbugs.

                    HERB
          We’ll hose you off before you come
          inside.

Herb smiles, teasing her. She rolls her eyes. He gives her
little a kiss on the head, goes back to get behind the wheel.
As they pull way, Margaret gives Grandma one last goodbye out
the back window. Sylvia gives her an air-kiss, Margaret give
one back.

Sylvia stands there watching them head off to their new life
without her, their car finally disappearing. She looks around
at the city. For the first time, she’s alone in it.
                                                           11.


EXT. FARBROOK, NEW JERSEY - DAY / VARIOUS

A sprawling SUPERMARKET with parking spaces galore. A GARAGE
SALE, junk spread out on a lawn. Kids in bathing suits on
BIKES, yelling as they chase an ICE-CREAM TRUCK.


EXT. MORNINGBIRD LANE - SAME

A tree-lined street of quaint, almost identical homes baking
under the summer sun.


EXT. SIMONS’ HOUSE - SAME

The Simons’ new residence is a CHARMING BRICK 2-STORY, the
shutters and front door freshly painted black.


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - SAME

Margaret arranges LITTLE HOMEMADE CERAMIC ANIMAL FIGURINES
she made with Barb, trying to build a new life for herself
here. She looks around the room -- it’s filled with all the
same stuff from her old room, but it doesn’t feel like home.


INT. SIMONS’ LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A disaster of BOXES and PACKING PAPER. Barb finishes
unpacking a CRATE OF BOOKS into a BUILT-IN BOOKSHELF, looks
around the room to see what’s next. It’s overwhelming, she’s
barely made a dent. She wipes away some SWEAT, SNIFFS her
armpit to see if she stinks.

                    MARGARET
          Do they smell bad?

Margaret comes down the stairs, catching her in the act.

                    BARBARA
          Well I can’t say they smell good.

Margaret makes a face.

                     BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Pretty soon you’ll know the
          feeling...

Margaret raises an eyebrow, not looking forward to that.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          We have so much stuff. I don’t even
          like half this stuff.
                                                          12.


She pulls an OLD CRUSTY MODEL SAIL BOAT out of a box. Why did
they even pack this? The DOOR BELL rings.

                    MARGARET
          I’ll get it.

Margaret crosses the FOYER, opens the FRONT DOOR to find a
girl in a swimsuit with her hands on her hips. This NANCY
WHEELER, 11 going on 17, overflowing with confidence.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          Hi...

                    NANCY
          I already know your name’s Margaret
          and you’re in 6th grade. The real
          estate agent sent a sheet out on
          you.

                    MARGARET
          Oh... Okay.

                     NANCY
          I’m Nancy. I’m in 6th too.
              (points to her house across
               the street)
          You wanna come over and go under
          the sprinklers with me?

                    MARGARET
          Uh, I don’t know.

                    NANCY
          You don’t know?

                    MARGARET
          I mean I have to ask. Just a sec.

Margaret goes back inside to Barb.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          There’s a girl from across the
          street who asked if I can run
          through her sprinklers.

Barb brightens a little, glad Margaret’s already making
friends, their move working out as planned.

                    BARBARA
          Oh. Good. Sure, fine by me.

                    MARGARET
          I need my bathing suit.
                                                           13.


Barb looks at the big mess, no clue where one would be.

                    BARBARA
          Oh boy... Good luck finding it in
          here.

                     NANCY
                 (appearing)
          It’s alright, she can borrow one of
          mine.

They turn to see Nancy has let herself inside.

                    BARBARA
          Oh. Hello. Nice to meet you...

                    NANCY
          Nancy. I live in the bigger house
          across the street.

Nancy points through the window at her better house. Barbara
smiles crookedly. Interesting kid.


EXT. NANCY WHEELER’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Nancy and Margaret head across the street. Nancy notices
Margaret’s bad posture.

                     NANCY
          You want a trick to stop slouching
          like that?

Margaret looks over, not sure what to say.

                     NANCY (CONT'D)
          Walk with your thumbs forward. It’s
          impossible to slouch when you do
          that, see.

Nancy demonstrates her forward-thumb, chest-out posture.

                    MARGARET
          Oh...

Margaret tries it, walking stiffly upright next to Nancy.

                    NANCY
          So whose class are you in at
          Delano?

                    MARGARET
          The letter said “room 18”...
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                  14.


                    NANCY
          I’m in 18 too! We were supposed to
          have Miss Phipps, but she ran off
          with some guy to California, so
          we’re getting a new teacher now.

They step into--


INT. NANCY WHEELER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

It’s full of EXPENSIVE ORNATE FURNITURE WITH CLAWED FEET.

                    NANCY
          Anyway, just pray for a good one.
          Come on, my room’s upstairs.


INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

POSTERS OF HEART THROBS peppered with Nancy’s lipstick
kisses, a DRESSER loaded with BOTTLES OF NAIL POLISH and
TANGLED COSTUME JEWELRY, a HEART-SHAPED MIRROR with “Nancy
Wheeler” scrawled a million times on the glass. A stark
contrast to Margaret’s patchwork childlike bedroom.             *

Nancy gets a BATHING SUIT out of a drawer, tosses it to
Margaret.

                    NANCY
          Here. It’s clean.

                    MARGARET
          Thanks. Where should I change?

                    NANCY
          What’s wrong with here?

Margaret pauses, a little self-conscious.

                    MARGARET
          Nothing... I don’t mind if you
          don’t mind?

                    NANCY
          Why would I mind?

                    MARGARET
          I don’t know...

Margaret starts to change into the suit. Nancy sits on the
edge of her bed, staring right at her as she does.
                                                        15.


Margaret turns around, carefully pretzeling herself so as not
to reveal her body.

                     NANCY
                 (laughs)
          Oh, you’re still flat.

Margaret’s cheeks flush. She yanks up the suit.

                    MARGARET
          Not exactly, I’m just small boned.

                    NANCY
          I’m already growing, see?

Nancy sticks her chest out to demonstrate.

                    NANCY (CONT'D)
          In a few years, I’m gonna have a
          pretty big chest. My mom’s are
          huge.

Margaret raises an eyebrow.

                    MARGARET
          Oh...

                    NANCY
          I thought you’d be a lot more grown
          up coming from New York. Have you
          ever kissed a boy?

                    MARGARET
          You mean...really kiss? Like on the
          lips?

                    NANCY
          Yeah. Have you?

                     MARGARET
                (beat, reluctantly)
          Not really...

Nancy looks relieved.

                    NANCY
          Neither have I... But I practice a
          lot. Wanna see?

Nancy picks up her pillow, opens her mouth wide and gives it
a LONG KISS, gently stroking the pillow’s “hair” and “back”.
It goes on for uncomfortably long.

Margaret can’t help but laugh. Nancy frowns, embarrassed.
                                                           16.


                     NANCY (CONT'D)
          You have to practice, or you won’t
          be a good kisser.
                  (then)
          You wanna see something else?

Margaret’s not sure she does. Nancy opens a DRESSER DRAWER
with a MILLION COSMETICS inside.

                    NANCY (CONT'D)
          It’s another one of my experiments.
          I put on different kinds to see how
          I look best so when 8th grade rolls
          around, I’ll be ready.

She runs a HAIRBRUSH through her long hair.

                    NANCY (CONT'D)
          Do you always wear your hair like
          that?

Margaret touches her mess of bobby pins, self-conscious.

                    MARGARET
          It’s in an in-between stage right
          now. I’m trying to grow it longer
          so it covers my ears. They stick
          out a little.

                       NANCY
          I noticed.

Apparently Nancy notices everything.

                    NANCY (CONT'D)
          Ready to go?

                       MARGARET
          Sure...


EXT. NANCY’S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

MRS. WHEELER (30’s), tan with big breasts and curled hair,
WASHES a LITTLE DOG in a TUB. The girls come out with their
towels.

                    NANCY
          This is the girl who just moved
          from New York. Margaret Simon.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Hi Margaret. Nice to meet you. How
          do you like Farbook so far?
                                                   17.


                    MARGARET
          It’s fine...

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Tell your mother I’m looking
          forward to meeting her. We have a
          bowling team on Mondays, and a
          bridge game Thursday afternoons.

                       MARGARET
          Oh...

Mrs. Wheeler cocks her head, waiting for more.

                       MRS. WHEELER
          Oh?

                    MARGARET
          No, I just don’t think my mom’s
          ever played Bridge and I don’t
          think she bowls either...

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Ahh. Well, tell her she can call me
          about carpooling to Sunday School
          then.

                    MARGARET
          I don’t go to Sunday school.

Mrs. Wheeler stops scrubbing the dog, surprised.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          You don’t go to Sunday School?

Margaret feels a little put on the spot.

                       MARGARET
          Uh...

                       NANCY
          Lucky you.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Nancy. Please.

                     NANCY
              (tugs Margaret away)
          Mom, she came to be with me, not
          you. Come on, let’s go.
                                                          18.


                     MRS. WHEELER
              (calling after them)
          30 minutes, no more or it drowns
          the grass!


EXT. NANCY’S YARD - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Nancy cranks on the SPRINKLER.

                    NANCY
          Follow the leader!

She dances through the water. Jumps, spins, cartwheels.
Margaret copies her move for move, trying to keep up.

Nancy pretends to run in sexy slow-motion like a girl from a
movie.

                    NANCY (CONT'D)
          Look at me, I’m a model.

She pouts her lips, runs her fingers through her wet hair.
Just then, A BIG HARD BLAST OF WATER nails her in the face.

                       NANCY (CONT'D)
          AAAAHHH!!!

Nancy’s brother EVAN (14), pudgy and freckled, holds the
HOSE, laughing with his friend, MOOSE FREED (14) handsome
with big brown eyes, a foot taller thanks to a recent growth
spurt.

                    NANCY (CONT'D)
          Evan you idiot!

                    MARGARET
          Who are they?

                     NANCY
          My stupid brother and his friend.
          They’re 14 and disgusting, all they
          think about is naked girls!
                 (screams)
          Mommmmm!!!

Nancy runs off to tattle. Both boys look at Margaret. She
quickly grabs the TOWEL, covering herself, thinking about the
naked girls comment.

                    EVAN
          Who’re you?
                                                        19.


                    MARGARET
          Um...Margaret? We just moved in
          across the street.

                    MOOSE
          You’re the new people? Ask your dad
          if he wants me to cut your lawn.
          Five bucks and I trim too.

                    MARGARET
          Uh... alright.

She smiles, trying to seem normal.

                    MRS. WHEELER (O.S.)
          Evan! Get over here right now!

Evan rolls his eyes, leaving Margaret with Moose.

Moose lifts up his arm to wipe some sweat, revealing a TINY
TUFT OF ARMPIT HAIR. Margaret stares at it a sec.

She shifts her weight, feeling nervous around him.

Moose bends down, picks up the Wheeler’s FALLEN BIRD FEEDER,
carefully hangs it back on its HOOK. Margaret watches,
transfixed.

                    MOOSE
          Gotta get ‘em more birdseed.

She nods. There’s a tiny flutter in her belly.

                    MOOSE (CONT'D)
          My name’s Moose Freed. Don’t forget
          to ask your dad about the lawn.

                    MARGARET
          I definitely won’t.

She grins at him. Then worries the grin is too much, tries
for something more casual. It’s not great either.


EXT. NANCY WHEELER’S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

Nancy walks Margaret back home.

                    NANCY
          Sorry you got stuck with Moose.

                    MARGARET
          Oh. That’s okay...
                                                           20.


Margaret decides she better not say how she really felt about
him. They stop in front of her HOUSE.

                    NANCY
          Anyway, listen Margaret, on the
          first day of school you have to
          wear loafers, but no socks.

                      MARGARET
          How come?

                    NANCY
          Because I decided I want you to
          join my secret club. There’s 3 of
          us, and I’m letting in one more.
          Just don’t wear socks or the other
          kids might not want you.

Margaret swallows, already feeling rejected.

                      MARGARET
          Okay...

Nancy waves and skips off, leaving Margaret with that.
Margaret stands there a moment, feeling her anxiety rise.


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Margaret organizes her SCHOOL SUPPLIES, thinking. Then--

                     MARGARET
                  (whispers)
          Are you there God? It’s me...
          Margaret again. It’s the first day
          of school tomorrow. Sometimes when
          I’m nervous, if I get my pens and
          pencils all facing the right
          direction, I feel a little better.

She looks at her METICULOUS DESK. It’s not helping at all.
She gets up from the chair, starts to pace a little.

                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
          Also... today I met this girl
          Nancy. She knew about a lot of
          stuff, I don’t know if she liked
          me, I think she expected me to be
          older or something? Anyway....it
          got me thinking, maybe it’s time...
          you know...
              (how does she put it?)
          ...things started happening...
          around here...
                                                          21.


She draws a quick little circle around her flat chest. Feels
a little embarrassed putting it so bluntly to God. Then
suddenly: The SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall.

                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
                  (lowers voice)
          My parents might think it’s weird
          we’re talking, so I’m just gonna do
          it without moving my lips.

Barb hurries in, carrying a bunch of RANDOM JUNK in her arms,
still getting through the unpacking.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                     (V.O.)
          Hey it’s me, I’m still here.

Barb tosses MARGARET’S BATHING SUIT onto her bed.

                    BARBARA
          It was in with the bathroom stuff.

                    MARGARET
                     (V.O.)
          Anyway, just think about, you know,
          what I mentioned...

Margaret’s eyes dart quickly at her chest again.

                    BARBARA
          And found this if you want it.

Barb puts an OLD ELECTRIC PENCIL SHARPENER on her desk.

                     MARGARET
          Thanks God.
              (then)
          Thanks mom.

Barb nods, exiting again.


EXT. SIMON’S HOUSE - MORNING

MORNING LIGHT streaks across the Simons’ front lawn,
GLISTENING WITH DEW. A perfect image.

A DIGITAL ALARM CLOCK goes off, wrecking it a little.


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

BARE FEET wriggle into a PAIR OF BROWN LOAFERS.
                                                           22.


Margaret steps in front of the mirror for a look at herself.
Takes a deep breath, anxious.


INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Barb has the kitchen almost in order, down to the last items.
Herb hurries to gobble some TOAST, running late. Margaret
walks in, hunched in her new blue jumper, her toes pointed
self-consciously inward.

                    BARBARA
          Heyyyy! There she is. You look
          great. All ready for the first day?

                    HERB
          Look at you. A 6th grade vision in
          blue!
                (kisses her head)
          Can’t wait to hear all about it.

Herb gives Barb a squeeze before rushing out. Barb pours
Margaret some cornflakes, senses her anxiety.

                    BARBARA
          How do you feel? You look nervous.
          Don’t be. Just don’t. I mean, it’s
          fine if you are, I still get
          nervous sometimes. It doesn’t go
          away cause you’re older. In fact,
          it might actually get worse...

Barbara realizes her pep talk is going the wrong way. Then--

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Wait, you forgot your socks.

                    MARGARET
          I don’t want socks.

                    BARBARA
          You do. Trust me, you’ll get
          blisters without them.

Margaret rolls her eyes a little, not in the mood to be
lectured. A LAWN MOWER ENGINE starts up next door, suddenly
JOGGING MARGARET’S MEMORY.

                    MARGARET
          Oh, wait! Dad!

She leaps up from her seat. Barb turns around, not sure what
the commotion is. Margaret runs to catch him.
                                                           23.


EXT. SIMONS’ DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Herb is already in the car, backing out of the driveway.

                    MARGARET
          Dad!

He sees her racing towards him, rolls down the window.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          A boy named Moose asked if you want
          him to cut our grass for 5 dollars.

                    HERB
          Tell him thanks but no thanks. Just
          bought a power-mower. Top of the
          line.

Shit.

                    MARGARET
          Uh...he also trims.

                    HERB
          Got a trimmer too. Two kinds. Might
          turn that shrub into a penguin.
          Gotta go honey, knock em dead
          today!

Herb starts to back out again. Margaret starts back towards
the house, finds Barbara waiting for her in the doorway.

                    BARBARA
          I just feel like I need to warn you
          one more time about the socks.

Margaret sighs, annoyed. Barbara puts up her hands, not
wanting to be a nagging mother.


EXT. DELANO SCHOOL - LATER THAT MORNING

First day chaos. Tons of TRAFFIC and WANDERING KIDS.


INT. DELANO SCHOOL - SAME

Margaret limps up the front steps through the MAIN ENTRANCE,
her sockless feet throbbing. She pulls down the heel of her
shoe to see a HOT RED BLISTER FORMING. She sucks it up, puts
her thumbs forward, trying to walk the way Nancy showed her.
She spots ROOM 18 up ahead.
                                                          24.


INT. 6TH GRADE CLASS - CONTINUOUS

Margaret enters, peers around for Nancy. Her eyes scan
everyone’s FEET. Socks, socks, socks. Then finally: NO SOCKS.
She pans to see the feet belong to Nancy.

                    NANCY
          Hey! Over here!

Margaret hurries over, relieved. Nancy checks her feet.

                     NANCY (CONT'D)
          Good. I thought you’d forget.
                    (then)
          This is Margaret, she’s the one I
          told you about.

GRETCHEN POTTER (11), Jewish, chubby, opinionated-- waves.
JANIE LOOMIS (11), skinny, soft-spoken, African American,
smiles.

                    GRETCHEN
          So you’re the fourth.

                    JANIE
          Nice to meet you...

                       MARGARET
          You too...

                    NANCY
          You’re lucky we saved you a seat,
          otherwise you’d be over there next
          to Norman Fisher.

NORMAN FISHER (11), ill-fitting button-down, bed-head, thick
glasses with a string, sits off by himself.

                    GRETCHEN
          Oh my god, oh my god, don’t look,
          Philip Leroy just walked in.

                    NANCY
          Yessss. I was praying so hard he’d
          be in our class!

                    MARGARET
          Who’s Philip Leroy?

                    NANCY
          Take a guess.
                                                        25.


Margaret looks over at a CLUSTER OF BOYS entering the room.
PHILIP LEROY (11) instantly stands out, casually great-
looking, sun-kissed from a summer of waterskiing.

                    MARGARET
          Oh. Got it.

Philip takes a seat next to his friend, FREDDY BARNETT (11),
a SHORT REDHEAD with an EXTREMELY BAD SUNBURN.

Margaret notices a TALL ATTRACTIVE WOMAN entering the room.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          Is that our teacher?

They all turn to look.

                     NANCY
          Her? That’s Laura Danker! She’s in
          our class!

Margaret looks again, feeling dumb.

                    MARGARET
          She’s in 6th grade?

LAURA DANKER (11), looks at least 16 thanks to her HEIGHT and
HUGE EARLY BOOBS.

                    NANCY
          Stay away from her if you’re smart.
          My brother says she goes behind the
          A&P with him and Moose and let’s
          them feel her up...

Margaret reacts to “feel her up,” not used to peers talking
like this. She watches Laura take a seat by herself in the
back row.

A THROAT CLEARS. They turn to see their new teacher, MILES J
BENEDICT (20’s) -- starched shirt, neatly combed hair. They
all quiet down, sit up straighter as he walks to the front of
the class.

                     MR. BENEDICT
          Uh, good morning class...
              (clears throat)
          Um, uh, first I’d just like to
          introduce myself... My name is Mr.
          Benedict and I will be your new 6th
          grade teacher.

He writes “MR. BENEDICT” on the chalkboard.
                                                        26.


                    MR. BENEDICT (CONT'D)
          That’s Benedict, like the eggs. And
          because it’s eggcellent to meet
          you.

He chuckles at his joke. They all just stare at him.

He clears his throat again. Looks down at a SWEATY SCRAP OF
PAPER tucked inside his palm, his INTRODUCTION speech written
on it.

“Benedict. Like the eggs. And because it’s egg-cellent to
meet you. (Pause for laughter.)”

He looks back up at their blank faces. Holds in an ocean of
nervous diarrhea.

                     NANCY
              (whispers to Margaret)
          Can you believe this guy?

Margaret feels a little sorry for him.

                    MR. BENEDICT
          Uh, now, if you’ll please complete
          the following sentences so we can
          get to know each other a little
          better...

He writes on the chalkboard: “I love...” “I hate...” “I’m
looking forward to...”

                     MR. BENEDICT (CONT'D)
          I’ll begin. I love...that I’m
          finally getting to be a teacher for
          the first time.
                  (smiles sincerely)
          I hate...self-doubt, feeling tongue
          tied, upset stomaches, and staring
          at the ceiling all night instead of
          sleeping at all.
                  (smiles again)
          I’m looking forward to...the year
          with you. Okay, now your turn.

They all take out paper and get busy writing. Nancy slides a
NOTE to Margaret: “Secret club meeting today. 3pm, my house.
NO SOCKS!!!”

                    NANCY
          Pass it on.

Margaret nods dutifully, passing it to Janie.
                                                        27.


INT. SYLVIA’S NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY

Sylvia finishes watering TWO LITTLE BAMBOO PLANTS sitting in
her window sill, then sits at the kitchen table, not sure
what to do next. She looks at the phone, then looks at her
watch. Margaret’s not home for several hours.


INT. SIMONS’ HOUSE / VARIOUS - THAT AFTERNOON

The KITCHEN is done now. Barb finishes wiping the counters,
goes into THE LIVING ROOM to see what’s left to do.

Just one BIG STACK OF BOXES remain, carrying all her ART
STUFF. PAINT BRUSHES, PAINTS, CANVASES, HER OLD ARTWORK. She
pulls out a few of her PAINTINGS. Eyeing some of the older
ones, she’s surprised by her reaction to them: She likes her
own work. She’s talented. Two endorsements she always
hesitates to give herself. She leans a few of them against
the walls to be hung up later.

Then glances around the room, trying to figure out where to
put all of her art supplies. She opens the HALL CLOSET:
already stuffed. Peaks in the LAUNDRY ROOM: Too small.


INT. SIMONS GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

She slides the ART BOXES into a CORNER next to a RUSTY FAN
and a BOX OF YEARBOOKS. Something about putting this stuff
here makes her a little sad. The end of a long-held part of
herself. But she brushes off the feeling, goes back into --


INT. SIMONS’ LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

As Barb comes into the room, she suddenly notices something
hadn’t until this moment, FROWNS.

The TATTERED LIVING ROOM SET from their New York apartment
has seen better days, and also looks RIDICULOUSLY SMALL in
their vast new suburban den. Just comically out of
proportion. Hmmm. This will definitely not work.

The PHONE RINGS. Barb crosses get it.

                       BARBARA
          Hello?

                       SYLVIA
          Guess who.

INTERCUT with Sylvia at her apartment, dusting her furniture
to pass the time.
                       Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)             28.


                    BARBARA
          Hello Sylvia. Margaret’s not home
          from school yet.

                       SYLVIA
          It’s 3:32.

                       BARBARA
          I know.

                    SYLVIA
          You said she’s out at 3:15 and the
          walk is 10 minutes.

                    BARBARA
          Yes, she’ll probably be here any
          minute.

                    SYLVIA
          Okay... I’ll... just wait I guess.

A beat as Sylvia waits for the few minutes to pass. Then she
realizes she should probably small-talk with Barbara.

                    SYLVIA (CONT'D)
          Um, so, how are you?

                    BARBARA
          Good. I’m good. How are you?

                    SYLVIA
          Oh fine... Today I read that when
          you don’t have any loved ones
          around your life expectancy drops
          drastically. But, you know, I’ve
          had a good run...

Barb can’t help but laugh at her guilt trip.

                     BARBARA
               (laughing)
          Oh Sylvia, come on.

Sylvia’s not kidding. The door opens behind Barb and Margaret   *
hurries in.                                                     *

                     BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Oh, here she is, she’s home.
              (holds out the phone)
          Grandma’s on the phone for you.

Margaret instantly perks up, drops her bag, runs to grab it.
                                                        29.


                     MARGARET
          Grandma!

                     SYLVIA
                  (lighting up)
          Honey!!! How’s New Jersey? Are you
          okay? You can tell me the truth.

                     MARGARET
          It’s actually not as bad as I
          thought...

                    SYLVIA
          Really? That’s wonderful news...

Sylvia looks crestfallen, secretly hoping it’d be bad enough
they’d all move back.

                    SYLVIA (CONT'D)
          Well, anyway, I was thinking you
          could come visit the weekend after
          next, I’ll get us tickets to a
          show, you can spend the night,
          we’ll do a little slumber party,
          that’d be so fun, right?

                    MARGARET
          Oooh yeah, I’d love that!

                    SYLVIA
          I knew you would. Great. I’ll tell
          your mother it was your idea, okay?
          I’ll call you tomorrow.

Margaret agrees, hangs up.

                    MARGARET
          Can I go to Nancy’s right now?

                    BARBARA
          You just got home, I haven’t even
          heard about your day.

                    MARGARET
          I know, can I?

                    BARBARA
          Well just at least give me one word
          first.

                     MARGARET
                 (thinks a beat)
          “Eghh?”
                                                           30.


A sound indicating “I don’t know, maybe it’ll be okay, maybe
it’ll be a truly hellish nightmare, we have to see.” Barbara
gets her meaning.

                    BARBARA
          Fair enough. Okay, go ahead.

Margaret hurries for the door.


INT. NANCY WHEELERS BACK PORCH - A LITTLE LATER

Nancy, Gretchen and Janie sit around the patio table eating
Oreos, LAUGHING. Margaret arrives through the back door,
wishing she weren’t the last one to get here.

                    MARGARET
          Hi...

She finds a seat at the table, reticent.

                    NANCY
          We were just talking about Laura
          Danker again.

                    GRETCHEN
          Yeah, how she got even bigger over
          the summer.

Gretchen cups her hands to show the size of Laura’s chest.
Margaret quickly nods in agreement, trying to catch up to
where they are in the conversation.

                    MARGARET
          Oh. Yeah, she looks so grown up...

Margaret crosses her legs, trying to seem cool. Her SHOE
falls off. She quickly leans down and puts it back on.

                    NANCY
          She’s worn a bra since 4th grade.
          I bet you a dollar she already gets
          her period too.

Margaret gets a little uncomfortable at the word “period”.
Janie does too. They share a look.

                    GRETCHEN
          Well I know for sure somebody in
          our school does.

                    JANIE
          How...?
                                                        31.


                    GRETCHEN
          I always check the bins.

Margaret’s never even thought of checking the bins.

                    NANCY
          Did you get it yet, Margaret?

Suddenly they’re all looking at her, waiting for a response.

                     MARGARET
                   (beat)
          Uh... not yet. Have you?

                    NANCY
          No, none of us have yet.

She couldn’t be more relieved. Nancy bangs her COKE CAN on
the table like a gavel.

                    NANCY (CONT'D)
          Alright, let’s get down to
          business. First, this secret club
          is a secret. You can’t tell anyone
          what happens here. Ever.

                    GRETCHEN
          Duh.

                    NANCY
          Second, if you want to be in it,
          you have to follow the club’s
          rules.

                    JANIE
          What kind of rules?

                     NANCY
          I don’t know, I haven’t thought of
          them yet. Oh, I just got one.
              (twiddles eyebrows)
          If you’re in the club, you have to
          wear a bra.

The energy in the room immediately shifts. Margaret crosses
her arms over her non-existent chest.

                    GRETCHEN
          I have one. If you get your period,
          you have to tell us about it.

                    NANCY
          Oooh, yes. Every detail. Especially
          how it feels.
                                                        32.


                    JANIE
          Mine is... what if we all keep a
          notebook of the boys we like?

They all love that idea too.

                     MARGARET
                (piggy-backing)
          Yeah, and, and we have to show it
          to each other at each meeting and
          we can’t ever lie.

The room tingles with excitement at the prospect of this kind
of sharing. Margaret smiles, starting to feel like part of
the group. She’s at the beginning of a whole new chapter.


EXT. FARBROOK - EARLY EVENING

RAINBIRDS spray a GRASSY PARK.


INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - LATER

Herb organizes his RECORDS in a COOL RECORD STAND now that he
has enough room to showcase his collection, Peggy Lee’s Fever
playing, absently singing along.

                    HERB
          Fever when you kiss me, fever when
          you hold me tight. Feva! You know
          her real name was Norma? Then a guy
          looks at her and goes “you don’t
          look like a Norma, you look like a
          Peggy” and she goes “Okay.”

But Margaret’s not listening. She’s studying something, her
BROW FURROWED, chewing her fingernails.

REVEAL: THE JC PENNEY CATALOGUE, opened to the BRA SECTION.
She has it tucked inside her HISTORY BOOK, angled so nobody
but her can see it.

How is she going to broach this? She looks over at her mom.

Barb is in THE KITCHEN looking at a PHOTO in a RECIPE BOOK: A
JUICY GOLDEN BROWN CHICKEN nestled in a clump of crispy
potatoes. She looks over at HER OWN VERSION: A LIMP GRAY
WATERY CARCASS floating next to BURNT BLACK POTATOES. It’s
somehow both overcooked and under-cooked.

                    BARBARA
             How is that even possible?
                                                        33.


She puts a PIECE OF PARSLEY on top of it, trying to make it
look more like the picture.


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Margaret climbs in bed, her mind still on the bra, Barb
dropping off some FOLDED LAUNDRY from a basket on her hip.

                     BARBARA
          Turns out I don’t hate laundry, I
          just hated going to the laundromat.
          Thank you, New Jersey.
              (walks over to kiss her)
          Goodnight, hon. See ya in the
          morning.

                    MARGARET
          Um...

Barb looks back at her. Margaret tries to bring up the bra.

                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
              (chickens out)
          Yeah, g’night.

Barb makes her way to the door, SHUTS OFF THE LIGHT. Margaret
regrets not having the guts. Just before the door closes--

                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
                  (blurts)
          I WANT TO GET A BRA!

Barb freezes. Margaret covers her face, mortified. Barb turns
the LIGHT BACK ON, a little dumbstruck. Unprepared for this
conversation. She treads lightly.

                    BARBARA
          Okay... Uh, you...you think you
          need one?

Margaret shoots her a mom hurt look. Barb realizes.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          No, no, I just mean, you know,
          they’re kind of a pain, so no need
          to start sooner than you have to.
          But if you want one, we’ll get one.

Margaret chews her lip, feeling so weird about this.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          So you want one?
                                                           34.


                    MARGARET
          Yes, I already said that!

She can’t stand to keep talking about it.

                    BARBARA
          Okay, okay. We’ll get one then.
          We’ll get one this weekend.

Margaret nods, just wanting this conversation to be over.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Alright. Well, g’night again.

                    MARGARET
          Night.

Barb walks out, pulls the door shut behind her, just stands
there a moment, realizing she’s just entered a whole new
phase of motherhood. Is she ready for it?

INSIDE, Margaret still cringes.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          So weird. So weird. That was so
          weird, God. Why do I feel so weird?

She drums her face, trying to knock the feeling out of her
head.


EXT./INT. DELANO SCHOOL - MORNING

School in session, kids in class. Barb hurries inside,
running a little late. Pokes her head into the PTA ROOM,
making sure she’s in the right place.


INT. DELANO SCHOOL P.T.A ROOM - SAME

A FEW DOZEN WOMEN mill around.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Here for the PTA meeting?

                    BARBARA
          Oh hi, yes, I’m Barbara Simon.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Oh! Barbara! I’m Jan Wheeler,
          Nancy’s mother. I met Margaret.
          I’ve heard a lot about you.

Hard to tell whether she means it in a good way.
                                                        35.


                    BARBARA
          Oh... great to meet you too.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          We’re just about to get started.
          Please, have a seat.

Barb finds a chair. Mrs. Wheeler gets up behind the PODIUM,
quiets everyone down.

                    MRS. WHEELER (CONT'D)
          Thank you all for coming today.
          Delano is nothing without our
          dedicated parents. So, let’s dive
          right in and start the year like we
          always do, by forming our
          committees. First... Our Campus
          Improvement Committee. Any
          volunteers?

Barb RAISES HER HAND. A few other women do too. Mrs. Wheeler
nods, grateful.

                    MRS. WHEELER (CONT'D)
          Thank you. Okay...Delano Social
          Committee. Dances, luncheons,
          parent-teacher night...

Barb RAISES HER HAND AGAIN. Why not.

                    MRS. WHEELER (CONT'D)
          Great. Restroom Sanitation
          Committee...

Nobody volunteers for that one. Barb RAISES HER HAND A 3rd
TIME. Mrs. Wheeler gives her an approving little nod.

                    MRS. WHEELER (CONT'D)
          Good for you, Barbara.

Barb smiles, feeling good about this.


INT. ROOM 18 / 6TH GRADE CLASS - LATER THAT DAY

The class finishes a MATH WORKSHEET. A stop watch BEEPS. Mr.
Benedict clicks it off.

                     MR. BENEDICT
          Alright, pencils down and kindly
          pass your worksheets forward...
              (gathering them up)
                     (MORE)
                                                          36.

                    MR. BENEDICT (CONT'D)
          Now, uh, before the bell rings, I’d
          like to share some news that I
          think will make you all very happy.

The class perks up, paying attention.

                    MR. BENEDICT (CONT'D)
          Now that you’re all in 6th grade...
          you’ll each get to do a full, year-
          long research project.

The whole class GROANS. This is the good news?

                    MR. BENEDICT (CONT'D)
          Wait, wait. Let me get to the good
          part. And these research projects
          will be about...anything you want.
          You decide. 100% your choice.

He waits for their expressions to brighten at the prospect of
such autonomy.

                    FREDDY BARNETT
          Are you kidding me?

They all complain even louder. Mr. Benedict sputters, not
expecting this.

                    MR. BENEDICT
          I... uh... well...

Freddy flicks a PAPER FOOTBALL at him.

                    MR. BENEDICT (CONT'D)
          What was that? Uh, please don’t do
          that again please?

THE BELL RINGS, thank god. They all pack up to leave. Mr.
Benedict gestures to Margaret.

                    MR. BENEDICT (CONT'D)
          Excuse me, Margaret, may I talk to
          you for a moment after class?

Margaret looks taken aback. Did she do something wrong?

                     NANCY
                  (teasing)
          Uh oh, what’d you do, Margaret?

Margaret swallows. Janie gives her a concerned look. As the
kids clear out, Margaret approaches Mr. Benedict’s desk.
                                                        37.


                    MARGARET
          Hi...

                    MR. BENEDICT
          Please, have a seat.

She reluctantly sits. Mr. Benedict shuffles through papers.

                    MARGARET
          Did I... do something wrong?

He looks up, suddenly seeing how nervous she is.

                    MR. BENEDICT
          Oh! No. No-no-no-no. Sorry, did I
          give that impression? Rookie
          mistake. Please, relax. Would you
          like anything? Water? Candy Corn?

He offers her his little JAR OF CANDY CORN.

                    MARGARET
          No...thank you.

Margaret loosens a little. He takes a piece of CANDY CORN for
himself. She watches him chew it for a moment.

                    MR. BENEDICT
          I’m just having little chats with
          each student in advance of your
          research projects to answer
          questions, perhaps guide you
          towards a topic of your choice...

                    MARGARET
          Oh.

                    MR. BENEDICT
          I read your getting-to-know you
          paper, and noticed under the “I
          hate” section, you wrote “religious
          holidays”? Which I found curious...

Margaret shifts in her seat, put on the spot.

                    MR. BENEDICT (CONT'D)
          If you don’t want to share why, you
          don’t have to.

                    MARGARET
          No, I, uh... I guess I just don’t
          like those holidays because I don’t
          celebrate any of them...
                    (MORE)
                                                        38.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          My dad is Jewish and my mom is
          Christian, so instead of picking
          which religion I am, they just
          decided I wouldn’t have one, and
          I’ll choose when I grow up...

                    MR. BENEDICT
          Ah, I see. And have you given that
          much thought?

                    MARGARET
          Not really... My grandma wants me
          to be Jewish...

                    MR. BENEDICT
          And your other grandparents want
          you to be Christian I imagine?

                    MARGARET
          I’ve never seen my other
          grandparents. They live in Ohio.

                    MR. BENEDICT
          You just talk to them on the phone.

                    MARGARET
          No, I’ve never met them at all.

Mr. Benedict absorbs this with curiosity.

                    MR. BENEDICT
          Interesting...

His curiosity begins to pique her own. That is pretty
interesting now that she thinks about it.

                    MR. BENEDICT (CONT'D)
          Well, if I may suggest it, religion
          could make a very compelling
          research topic for you...

Margaret nods, still thinking about her grandparents.


EXT. SIMONS HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

A SALVATION ARMY TRUCK idling out front.


INT. SIMONS HOUSE - SAME

Barbara tries to wrap up a phone call with Sylvia while THE
SALVATION ARMY GUYS carry out their OLD FURNITURE. Sylvia’s
in her APARTMENT, standing next to a PORTRAIT OF HERSELF.
                                                       39.


                    SYLVIA (O.S.)
          Mezzanine tickets, dead center.
          Tell her that.

                      BARBARA
          I will.

                    SYLVIA (O.S.)
          Is she excited?

Barbara’s losing patience.

                    BARBARA
          Yes. She’s excited.

One of the GUYS hands Barb the DONATION RECEIPT.

                     BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Really gotta go now, call you later
          Sylvia.
              (takes receipt)
          Thanks.

                    SALVATION ARMY GUY
          God bless you.

Margaret walks in just as they’re leaving.

                    MARGARET
          What happened to the couch?

                      BARBARA
          Oh it   was old and too small for the
          room.   Time to turn a new leaf.
          Maybe   something modern? I don’t
          know,   I need to think about it...

The men exit and she closes the door, crosses to the
SECRETARY DESK to file it.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          How was school? You’re later than
          normal.

                    MARGARET
          Fine. How come I’ve never talked to
          your mom or dad?

Barb’s posture changes, caught off guard.

                    BARBARA
          Uh...what made you think of that?
                                                           40.


                     MARGARET
                  (beat)
          Just wondering.

Barb slides the receipt into a FILE FOLDER, thrown off-
balance by the question.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          I know we don’t see them because
          they’re far away, but why don’t we
          even call them?

Barb’s not sure how to handle this. She steadies herself,
weighing it.

                    BARBARA
          Because...we just don’t. It’s a
          long story.

                    MARGARET
          What do you mean.

                    BARBARA
          I mean I’ll tell you some other
          time.

                    MARGARET
          Why can’t you just tell me now?

Margaret looks at her, really wanting to know. Barb can tell
she’s not getting out of this.

                    BARBARA
          Look, I just don’t want you to be
          burdened by anything... But maybe,
          I don’t know, maybe you’re old
          enough to hear this now...

Now Margaret is even more interested. Barb releases a breath,
has out with it.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          The truth is... we don’t see my
          parents because they don’t want to
          see us.

Margaret furrows her brow, not getting it. Barb tries to
explain.
                                                           41.


                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          My mom and dad are very, very
          devout Christians, and before you
          were born, when your dad and I
          first fell in love, they told me
          they would never accept a Jewish
          son-in-law, and that if I wanted to
          marry him and ruin my life, that
          was my business...but I wouldn’t be
          their daughter any longer.

Retelling this story, Barb can’t help but feel those old
emotions rising up in her.

                    MARGARET
          But...you are their daughter.

Margaret doesn’t understand. Barb realizes she has to phrase
this more clearly.

                    BARBARA
          What I mean is that they... they
          decided they didn’t want me in
          their life anymore.

It’s difficult to say it so plainly.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          And so... I’m not. It’s been that
          way going on 14 years.

Margaret is pinned to her chair. Heartbroken for her mom.

                    MARGARET
          Mom...

She moves towards Barb, wrapping her arms around her to
comfort her. Barb feels herself choke up a little, then wills
it back, not wanting Margaret to take this on, uncomfortable
feeling their parent-child dynamic reversed.

Barb gives her a little pat, reassuring Margaret she’s okay.

                    BARBARA
          It was a long time ago, Margaret.

Barb smiles resiliently, determined to lift the mood.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Come on. I took dad to the train
          station so we’d have the car. We
          had a plan to go shopping,
          remember?
                                                        42.


Barb stands to find her purse and keys. Margaret’s head is
still whirling.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          Are you there God, It’s me,
          Margaret. I can’t believe this.


INT. SIMONS CHRYSLER - A LITTLE LATER

They drive to the mall.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          How could they be so mean? Just
          because of a dumb religion?


EXT. LORD & TAYLOR PARKING LOT - A LITTLE LATER

They near the entrance of the store.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          My mom doesn’t deserve this. She’s
          a good person, she’s nice to
          everyone.

Barb holds the door open for an absurdly long time, letting a
whole parade of people go into the store before her.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          Even when she doesn’t need to be!


INT. LORD & TAYLOR DEPARTMENT STORE - A LITTLE LATER

They float up the ESCALATOR.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          I mean, what the heck, God? How
          could you let this happen? Religion
          is supposed to bring people
          together and make them love each
          other more, isn’t that right there
          in all your books and stuff?!

                    BARBARA
          The bras are over there.

At the word “BRAS,” Margaret instantly SNAPS INTO THE PRESENT
MOMENT, abandoning her conversation with God. She eyes the
MANNEQUINS IN LINGERIE, suddenly very uncomfortable.
                                                           43.


Barb leads them through THE UNDERWEAR DEPARTMENT up to a
SALES LADY (60’s), cat eye-glasses, built like a baked
potato.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Excuse me, we’re looking for a bra
          for my daughter.

Margaret immediately stares at her shoes, pretending to know
nothing about this. The lady sizes up Margaret’s chest.

                    SALES LADY
          Hmmmm. Well we don’t have many that
          small...

Margaret just about dies.

                    SALES LADY (CONT'D)
          Come’re, dear, let me measure you.

Margaret reluctantly follows her to the REGISTER. The lady
loops a TAPE MEASURE around her chest, puts a 2ND PAIR OF
GLASSES over her cat-glasses to see the number.

                     SALES LADY (CONT'D)
              (clicks tongue, bad news)
          Barely 28. Not even a Double-A.

Margaret’s really starting to resent this lady.

                    SALES LADY (CONT'D)
          Your best bet is one these Gro-bras
          here. So one day when you do grow,
          it’ll grow with you.

                    BARBARA
          Thank you. We’ll go try it on.


INT. LORD & TAYLOR DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Margaret and Barb step into a STALL.

                     BARBARA
              (takes bra off hanger)
          You know how to put it on?

                     MARGARET
              (not at all)
          Yes.

Margaret quickly takes the bra, turns around the opposite way
to slip off her shirt, awkwardly fumbles with it, getting
hung up in the straps.
                                                           44.


                    BARBARA
          Here, I’ll help you out.

Barb adjusts the straps, clasps the back.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          There you go.

Margaret slowly turns around, feeling extremely exposed.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          What do you think?

                    MARGARET
          I don’t know.

                    BARBARA
          Well does it feel too tight?

                    MARGARET
          I don’t think so.

                       BARBARA
          Too loose?

                       MARGARET
          No.

                    BARBARA
          Try moving around a little.

Margaret wiggles her shoulders, pumps her arms.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          How’s it feel now?

                    MARGARET
          Fine but I’ll be glad to take it
          off.

                    BARBARA
          Yep. Welcome to womanhood.


EXT. MORNINGBIRD LANE - SATURDAY / DAY

The weekend in full swing. Neighbors weeding their yards,
washing their cars, kids playing freeze tag.
                                                          45.


EXT. SIMONS FRONT YARD - SAME

Barb gets the MAIL, sees her FURNITURE CATALOGUE has arrived.
Flips through it a bit at the curb. Then looks up to see Herb
rolling his NEW POWER LAWN MOWER onto the grass.

                    BARBARA
          Look at you. Working the land...
          Heavy machinery...

                    HERB
          Is it too much if I take my shirt
          off?

She laughs. Herb unbuttons one of his shirt buttons, starts
the motor with extra manly flair. She bites her lip,
pretending to be turned on. He pushes it across the lawn like
a stud, popping a wheely.


INT. MARGARET’S BATHROOM   - SAME

Just out of the shower in a BATHROBE, Margaret heads into--


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

She closes her curtains and gets some UNDERWEAR out   of her
drawer, pulls it on, then pauses, suddenly noticing   something
different. She bends over, looking closer. Her eyes   widen.
Hairs. She pretzels her head down closer, squinting   at them.

                     MARGARET
          1 2 3... 4 5 6 7.
              (impressed)
          Seven.

Not bad. She pulls the GRO-BRA out of LORD AND TAYLOR BAG,
rips the tags off, wriggles into it with much effort.

Then turns to study herself in the mirror. Flat as a board.
She turns sideways, pulls her shoulders all the way back,
pushing her chest out as far as she can. It makes no
difference. She sighs, frustrated.

Thinking, she gets two BALLED UP PAIRS OF SOCKS out of her
top drawer, stuffs them into each cup. They’re ridiculous and
misshapen. It doesn’t matter. She absolutely loves them.

She walks cat-like around the room, feeling them out.
                                                        46.


                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
                  (sexy voice)
          My name’s Laura Danker, what’s
          yours?

She puts on one of her RECORDS: Chica Chica Boom Chic, by
Carmen Miranda. Begins to DANCE around the room, swinging her
sock-boobs back and forth, playing the bongos on them, her
and her boobs becoming the star of their own music video.

Suddenly, there’s a SCREAM from the front yard.

                    HERB (O.S.)
          AHHHHHH!! DAMMIT!!!

Margaret startles, yanked back into reality. She runs to the
WINDOW, looks out it to see Herb next to the lawnmower with a
VERY BLOODY HAND.


INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - LATER

Herb’s hand is BANDAGED UP now, embarrassed by his blunder
after making so much fanfare. Barbara reads the LAWNMOWER
DIRECTIONS to find out what went wrong.

                    BARBARA
          “Always turn mower off before
          clearing grass clippings from the
          bag...”

                    HERB
          Pssh. In sales we call that a
          design flaw.

Margaret squeezes past them carrying a GLASS OF WATER and a
NOTEBOOK towards the backdoor, already excited about the
silver lining: MOOSE IS CUTTING THE REST OF THEIR GRASS NOW.


EXT. SIMONS BACKYARD - SAME

                    MARGARET
          Hi...

She puts the water down for him. He waves thanks. She takes a
seat on a LAWN CHAIR, opens the LITTLE NOTEBOOK, where the
words Boys I like are written & underlined at the top.


INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM - DAY

The four girls sit in a circle on the floor.
                                                        47.


                      NANCY
          Veronica?

                      GRETCHEN
          I’m here.

                      NANCY
          Kimberly?

                      GRETCHEN
          Here.

                      NANCY
          Mavis?

                      MARGARET
          Here.

                    NANCY
          And so am I...Alexandra.

                    JANIE
          Why do we have to have these names
          again?

                    NANCY
          Because it’s boring using our
          normal ones. Okay, time for boy
          books.... Everyone get them out.

Margaret opens her LITTLE NOTEBOOK, where she’s listed just
one boy: Moose Freed. A LITTLE HEART by his name.

                    NANCY (CONT'D)
          So who wants to go first?

                    GRETCHEN
          Like it matters. We already know
          who everyone put down.

                    NANCY
          Philip Leroy!

                    JANIE
          Of course...

                    GRETCHEN
          It’s been the same since 2nd grade!

                    NANCY
          What about you, Margaret? Who’d you
          put?
                                                        48.


                     MARGARET
                (closes her book)
          Oh... yeah, I put him too. Philip
          Leroy. He’s so cute.

                    NANCY
          Well, that was quick. Alright, time
          to check for bras.

Nancy walks behind each girl, feeling their backs for a bra
strap.

                    NANCY (CONT'D)
          Gretchen has a bra, Janie has a
          bra, Margaret has a bra...and
          (snaps her own) I have bra. Good.
          Now we have to go around and say
          what size it is.

                     MARGARET
              (eyes dart around, nervous)
          What? That wasn’t a rule.

                    NANCY
          It’s a new one, I just made it up.

                     GRETCHEN
          Well mine doesn’t have a size, it’s
          a Gro-Bra.

                    JANIE
          Yeah, that’s what I have too!

Margaret is so relieved she’s not the only one.

                       MARGARET
          Same here.

                    NANCY
          Not me. Mine’s a 32 Double-A.

Nancy puts her shoulders back, proud. They all look at her,
impressed.

                    NANCY (CONT'D)
          If you ever want to get out of
          those baby bras, you have to
          exercise like I do.

                     MARGARET
               (suddenly very interested)
          What kind of exercise?

Nancy stands, demonstrating.
                                                          49.


                    NANCY
          Hold your arms out like this, and
          then you do this motion over and
          over.

Nancy pumps her arms back and forth, flexing her pecks.

                    NANCY (CONT'D)
          I must, I must, I must increase my
          bust!

                    JANIE
          That really works?

Margaret and Janie exchange a look, hoping so.

                    NANCY
          Try it. You’ll see.

They all stand up, pumping their arms along with her.

                    ALL TOGETHER
          I must, I must, I must increase my
          bust!

                    NANCY
          Now squeeze real hard when you say
          it.

They all squeeze. Margaret squeezes harder than anyone.

                    ALL TOGETHER
          We must, we must, we must increase
          our bust! We must, we must, we must
          increase our bust!

Suddenly, the BEDROOM DOOR SWINGS OPEN. Evan and Moose burst
in, LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY.

                    NANCY
          What are you doing?! Get out of my
          room!

                     EVAN
          WE MUST, WE MUST, WE MUST INCREASE
          OUR BUST!
                (groping his chest)
          Oooh I can feel it working, Moose!

Margaret is mortified.

                    NANCY
          Shut up!!! Get out! Get out! Get
          out! Mommmmmmmm!!!
                                                        50.


Nancy chases them out of the room, slapping at Evan.


EXT. NEW JERSEY BUS TERMINAL - DAY

Margaret is still cringing about what happened with Moose as
she hurries with her parents to catch the BUS to NYC.

                    BARBARA
          Grandma said she’ll meet you at the
          information desk. When you get on
          the bus, do not talk to anyone.
          Especially men. Either sit alone or
          pick out a nice lady.

                     MARGARET
          I will.

                    HERB
          If you don’t see Grandma when you
          get there, ask someone to help you.

                    BARBARA
          But make sure it’s a lady, not a
          man.

                    MARGARET
          Okay, you told me 20 times!

                     BARBARA
              (to bus driver)
          Excuse me, this little girl is
          traveling alone, can you please
          keep an eye on her?

                     MARGARET
          Mommmmm.

                    BARBARA
          Okay okay, g’bye.

Margaret gets on the bus, the doors closing behind her. Barb
suddenly regrets this, second-guessing her parenting.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          I hope this wasn’t a mistake.

Just then, a CRAZY HOMELESS LOOKING PASSENGER bangs on the
side of the bus through his open window, yelling for the bus
to MOVE. He flicks his CIGAR BUTT onto the tarmac. Herb
smiles at Barb.

                     HERB
          Nah.
                                                        51.


INT. NY BOUND BUS - SAME

Margaret takes a WINDOW SEAT BY HERSELF in the back, staying
away from the WEIRD GUY.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          Are you there God? It’s me,
          Margaret. I’m a little nervous
          being alone so can you just not let
          anything really horrible happen?

Margaret looks over to notice TWO NUNS sitting across the
aisle from her.

                    MARGARET
          Oh good. That makes me feel better.

She breathes a sigh of relief. Then considers--

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          You know, maybe Mr. Benedict had a
          good idea -- if I made my research
          project about religion, then I
          could finally pick one. Don’t
          worry, I won’t make any decisions
          without asking you first. What do
          you think, God?

Margaret waits a sec, as if for an answer. Something inside
her responds in the affirmative. She shakes her head.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          Okay. We’ll do it.

She looks out the window, feeling resolved.


EXT. PORT AUTHORITY BUS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

Ten times more crowded than New Jersey’s terminal. Margaret
stands on her toes, looking for her grandma, finally spots
Sylvia, who’s a BLONDE now.

                     MARGARET
          Grandma!

                    SYLVIA
          You made it!!!

Sylvia sprays her with a CAN OF DISINFECTANT.
                                                         52.


                    SYLVIA (CONT'D)
          It’s just Lysol, don’t worry about
          it. Just gettin’ the bus off. You
          look beautiful!

                    MARGARET
          So do you. Your hair’s blonde!

                    SYLVIA
          Everyone thinks I’m a show-girl!
          Come on, we don’t want to miss
          anything.

Sylvia whisks her away.


EXT. LINCOLN CENTER - MAGIC HOUR

Sylvia and Margaret climb out of a CAB, head up the steps
towards THE ICONIC FOUNTAIN and MASSIVE COLUMNS all lit up.


INT. LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA PIT - A LITTLE LATER

A COUPLE VIOLINISTS playing Dance of the Little Swans.


INT. LINCOLN CENTER AUDITORIUM - LATER

20 BALLERINAS spin in unison, performing SWAN LAKE.

Sylvia and Margaret watch them, in awe.

Margaret slips out of her flats to stretch her feet. Sylvia
slides her high-heels off too, wiggles her stocking feet over
to Margaret’s to give them a “kiss.” They smile at each
other.


EXT. NYC - NIGHT

Margaret and Sylvia stroll through NYC after the show,
goofing around pretending to be ballerinas.


INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - LATER

The WAITER sets TWO COMICALLY HUGE CHOCOLATE PARFAITS and a
couple SPOONS in front of Margaret and Sylvia.

                    SYLVIA
          Spoons? How about a shovel? Thank
          god I did 10 minutes of aerobics
          two weeks ago.
                                                        53.


Margaret laughs. They dig in.

                    MARGARET
          Grandma...I have to tell you a
          secret.

                    SYLVIA
          Oooh. I’m listening.

                     MARGARET
              (leans in, whispers)
          I’m wearing a bra tonight, could
          you tell?

                     SYLVIA
              (smiles, conspiratorial)
          I didn’t want to say anything, but
          bosoms run in the family...

Sylvia makes a little gesture at her own good-sized bosoms.
Margaret grins a mile wide.


INT. SYLVIA’S BEDROOM - LATER

Sylvia and Margaret are in nightgowns now, crawling into BED,
Sylvia rubbing her face and hands with a MENAGERIE OF CREAMS
lined up on her nightstand.

                    SYLVIA
          I had a fabulous time tonight. You
          make a great date.

                     MARGARET
          You too.

They crawl under the covers.

                    SYLVIA
          Goodnight, honey. If I snore or
          pass gas, that’s not me, you’re
          just dreaming it.

                      MARGARET
                  (laughs)
          Okay.

Sylvia switches off the LAMP. They lay in the dark for a sec.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          Hey Grandma?

                    SYLVIA
          Yes, Sugar?
                                                        54.


                    MARGARET
          Do you think I could go to Temple
          with you some time?

Sylvia’s EYES SNAP OPEN, she SITS UP, flips the LIGHT BACK
ON, wide awake suddenly.

                     SYLVIA
          YOU BET YOU CAN!
              (jumps out of bed)
          We’re going in the morning, I gotta
          iron my suit!


EXT. NEW YORK SYNAGOGUE - NEXT DAY

TONS OF PEOPLE dressed to the nines. Sylvia leads Margaret
towards the entrance, still ecstatic about this surprise
twist of fate.

As they pass the GREETER--

                    SYLVIA
          I have my granddaughter with me
          today.

The GREETER nods politely, not caring at all.


INT. NEW YORK SYNAGOGUE - CONTINUOUS

They find their seats. Sylvia waves to more people.

                     SYLVIA
          This is my granddaughter.
               (looks at another group,
               points at Margaret)
          Granddaughter.

Margaret smiles hello at everyone, not quite sure how to act.
Sylvia spots THE RABBI walking up to the PODIUM.

                    SYLVIA (CONT'D)
          There he is, that’s the Rabbi.
          Isn’t he handsome? He looks like
          Robert Redford. If Robert Redford
          had a large black beard and
          glasses.

The MUSIC BEGINS, signaling the service is starting. Sylvia
squeezes Margaret’s arm.

                    SYLVIA (CONT'D)
          Here we go, it’s starting.
                                                        55.


Margaret sits up straighter, a little anxious.

                    RABBI
          Welcome dear friends. So good to be
          here with all of you this morning.
          Shabbat shalom.

                     SYLVIA
                   (whispers)
          Shabbat shalom means hello. And
          goodbye. And peace and harmony and
          other stuff.

Sylvia hands her a PRAYER BOOK. Margaret opens it backwards.
Sylvia flips it around for her. Margaret already feels lost.

                    RABBI
          So let us lift our voices in thanks
          to God this morning. We begin on
          page 124 of our prayer books--
                  (reading)
          Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh
          ha`olam....

He keeps going in Hebrew. Margaret glances at Grandma for a
translation, but Sylvia’s Hebrew ends at “Shabbat Shalom.”
Margaret tries to follow but her eyes glaze over. She starts
to glance around the room and COUNT HATS.

                     MARGARET (V.O.)
          1, 2, 3...4, 5, 6 brown ones.
                 (then)
          1, 2, 3--
              (realizes)
          God, why am I counting hats?

Margaret tries to focus again. The CANTOR sings, there are
more prayers, more rituals, more Hebrew. Her posture begins
to sags.

TIME CUT: Margaret JOLTS, as if woken from sleep. Everyone
stands up, the service over. Sylvia smiles.

                    SYLVIA
          Wasn’t that lovely? Oh honey,
          congratulations.

Sylvia hugs her as if she’s officially jewish now.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          I don’t know, God. The Rabbi seemed
          nice and I liked the music, but I
          guess I thought I’d feel something
          else. Like, you know --
                    (MORE)
                                                           56.

                     MARGARET (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              (spiritual epiphany sound)
           “Laaaaaaaaaa!”.

Margaret’s a little disappointed. But Sylvia puts her arm
around her, thrilled.

                    SYLVIA
          And now we go to the deli and
          kvetch!


INT. SIMON’S KITCHEN - NEXT EVENING

Barb unloads the DISHWASHER, upset. Margaret puts away the
silverware. Herb pulls a TV DINNER out of the oven.

                    BARBARA
          I can’t believe she’d just take you
          to Temple without even asking us.

                    HERB
          I can’t believe it took her this
          long.

                    MARGARET
          I told you it was my idea. I just
          wanted to try it out, I’m gonna try
          church too, don’t worry mom.

                    BARBARA
          Church is not the point. You don’t
          need to bother yourself with this
          stuff right now.

                    MARGARET
          You said I can pick my religion
          when I grow up.

                    BARBARA
          Yeah, when you grow up. When you’re
          an adult.

                    MARGARET
          I’m almost 12. That is an adult.

Barb LAUGHS. Margaret feels mocked, shuts the silverware
drawer, leaving the room.

                    BARBARA
          Margaret...

                    HERB
          Hey, I just turned on Fats Domino.
          Don’t leave, its groovin’ time.
                                                         57.


He does a little jig to Aint That A Shame by Fats Domino,
trying to change the mood. But Margaret keeps walking. Herb
shrugs at Barb. He tried. She sighs, worried maybe she
handled that badly.

Herb sits down with his TV DINNER on a LAWN CHAIR he’s set up
in front of the TV since they still don’t have furniture.
Barb looks at him, feels like she’s failing as a wife too.

                    BARBARA
          Sorry, I swear I’m gonna order the
          furniture soon, I just want to pick
          the right stuff, you know, so
          everything goes together, like how
          people have it.

Herb waves it away. No big deal.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          And I was gonna cook dinner, I was
          going to, but the meat didn’t thaw
          and--

                    HERB
          Hey hey hey, didn’t you hear what I
          said about “groovin’ time”? It’s
          all good, baby. Look at me, I’m
          leaned back to 3. I’m solid gold.

He gestures to his lawn chair, reclined to the 3rd notch.
Barb laughs. This is why she gave up everything for him.


EXT. THE WHEELERS HOUSE - DAY

Moose rakes FALL LEAVES off the Wheelers’ grass.


INT. THE WHEELER’S HOUSE / DEN   - DAY

Mrs. Wheeler sets a TRAY OF ICED TEA on the COFFEE TABLE.
Barb and THREE OTHER MOTHERS ON THE CAMPUS IMPROVEMENT
COMMITTEE sit in the den.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Here we are, ladies.

                    BARBARA
          Thank you, Jan.

Barb takes a sip. A LEMON SEED gets in her mouth. She
awkwardly spits it in her hand, embarrassed. She looks
around, not sure where to throw it away.
                                                           58.


                    MRS. WHEELER
          I’ll take it.

Mrs. Wheeler reaches out a hand. Barb drops it into her palm,
feeling like a child. Mrs. Wheeler takes it to the trash,
comes back.

                    MRS. WHEELER (CONT'D)
          So, last year we replaced the
          school marquee... and this year, I
          had an idea to do something even
          more meaningful.

She smiles, very pleased with herself. The women wait in
suspense.

                    MRS. WHEELER (CONT'D)
          You know how ugly the ceiling in
          our Gymnasium is? We’ll have it
          refinished, painted completely
          black, and then we’ll hang little
          stars from it, with each Delano
          child’s name on them...

Mrs. Wheeler holds up a FELT STAR she cut out as an example.

                    PTA MOTHER
          Awww. Our own night sky filled with
          our own little stars...

They all coo at that adorable image.

                    BARBARA
          That’s so cute. How many stars do
          we need, how many kids are there?

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Twenty three hundred and two.

Mrs. Wheeler puts SEVERAL BOLTS OF LIGHT BLUE FELT and FOUR
PAIRS OF SCISSORS in front of them. Barb blinks.


EXT. DELANO SCHOOL - DAY

ON THE BLACK TOP, WESTERN MUSIC plays, all the kids awkwardly
SQUARE DANCING for P.E. Mr. Benedict reads the dance calls,
way out of his comfort zone.

                     MR. BENEDICT
                (stiffly, from a Xerox)
          And one and two and dosey-doe, all
          the way around the ring you go.
                     (MORE)
                                                          59.

                     MR. BENEDICT (CONT'D)
          Now boys rock right, now girls go
          low, now all the way around and
          dosey-doe.

The kids are clumsy and terrible at it. Norman Fisher keeps
stepping on Margaret’s feet.

                     NORMAN
          Sorry.
              (does it again)
          Sorry again.

Margaret gives Janie a look expressing her annoyance with
Norman. Janie rolls her eyes, commiserating. The BELL RINGS,
thank god. As the kids disperse, Nancy hurries over with
Gretchen in a tow. She has a shit-eating grin on her face.

                     NANCY
              (whispers)
          Gretchen stole it.

                    JANIE
          Stole what?

Nancy nods for Gretchen to show them. Gretchen slyly unzips
her bag, giving them a peek: A HUMAN ANATOMY TEXT BOOK.

                    GRETCHEN
          My dad’s book I told you about.

All the girls’ eyes get big. Margaret fidgets, nervous,
feeling like an accomplice to a crime.


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

C.U.: A DETAILED DRAWING OF THE MALE BODY, INCLUDING PENIS.

The girls hover over it silently, taking it in.

                    JANIE
          Whoa.

                     GRETCHEN
          Do you think Philip Leroy looks
          like that?

                    NANCY
          He’s male, isn’t he?

Margaret swallows. Checks the door again just to make sure no
one can come in. HER DESK CHAIR is shoved in front of it.
                                                        60.


                    JANIE
          Veins. Uggckk...

                    GRETCHEN
          That’s what everyone looks like
          inside their body.

                    JANIE
          I don’t like it. It’s disturbing.

                    NANCY
          Turn the page.

Gretchen flips the page to the book’s real gold: A CLOSE-UP
DRAWING OF A PENIS AND TESTICLES.

They all get very quiet again.

                     MARGARET
              (whispers)
          Oh my god...

Nancy grins. She was waiting for that reaction.

                    NANCY
          My brother’s looks like that.

                    JANIE
          Ew, how do you know?

                    NANCY
          He walks around naked. I see it.

Margaret shakes off a visual of naked Evan.

                    GRETCHEN
          My dad used walk around naked when
          I was little. His looked like that
          too. And really red. Like a bad
          sunburn.

                    JANIE
          Oh god. Ew. I never want to see
          anyone naked or have anyone see me
          naked.

                    NANCY
          What about when you get married?

                    JANIE
          Especially then.
                                                        61.


                    NANCY
          Trust me, you’ll change your mind
          once you grow a little. Then you’ll
          want the whole world to see you,
          like the girls in Playboy.

                    JANIE
          What girls in Playboy?

                    NANCY
          You’ve never seen Playboy?

                    JANIE
          Where would I see it?

                    MARGARET
          My dad gets Playboy...

                    NANCY
          Wait, so you have a copy here in
          this house? Go get it!

Margaret suddenly regrets revealing that.

                    MARGARET
          I...I don’t know if I....

                    NANCY
          Come on, Gretchen stole her dad’s
          anatomy book, it’s only fair you
          steal us the Playboy!

All of the girls look at her. Margaret feels the pressure.


INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

Margaret tip-toes down the hallway, glances downstairs to
check the coast is clear, sees Barb busy cutting out FELT
STARS, a STRIP OF MUSTACHE BLEACH on her lip, standing by the
TV watching a COOKING PROGRAM, hoping to learn something.

Margaret continues down the hall to--


INT. BARBARA AND HERB’S MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

She slips inside, surveys the room. Tries the MAGAZINE RACK.
Then Herb’s NIGHTSTAND. No dice. She kneels down, looks under
his side of the bed. Bingo... The WHOLE STACK. She takes one,
quickly stuffs it under her shirt.
                                                        62.


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

The girls are all huddled behind Nancy as she opens the
magazine, turning it long-ways so the CENTER FOLD UNFURLS.

Their eyes adjust to the image.

                    JANIE
          That isn’t like the science book...

                     GRETCHEN
          Look how round they are...
              (disappointed)
          Mine look like little wizard hats.

Margaret laughs. Gretchen gives her a look.

                    GRETCHEN (CONT'D)
          Hey, at least I have something.

Margaret zips her lips.

                    NANCY
          “Hillary Brite is 19 years old and
          loves waterskiing, horses, and
          going to the mall for an Orange
          Julius.”

                    GRETCHEN
          Do you think any of us will look
          like that at 19?

They all look at each other, desperately hoping so. CUT TO:

                    ALL THE GIRLS
          WE MUST, WE MUST, WE MUST INCREASE
          OUR BUST! WE MUST WE MUST WE MUST
          INCREASE OUR BUST!

Off their PUMPING ARMS--


INT. JANIE’S CHURCH - DAY

ANOTHER SET OF PUMPING ARMS, clapping rhythmically. A GOSPEL
CHOIR, harmonizing with a A BADASS 80-YEAR-OLD LEAD
SINGER/PASTOR, tearing it up with his killer pipes.

Margaret stands with Janie and her FAMILY, clapping along.
Margaret looks around, trying to feel out if this is “it.”
It’s great, but she’s not so sure. JANIE’S MOM smiles over at
her, making sure she’s having a good time.
                                                           63.


                     MARGARET
                  (nods)
          Thanks for having me.

She gives Margaret a little shoulder squeeze. Janie elbows
Margaret, nods at an OLD WOMAN a few seats over, DEAD ASLEEP
IN THE PEW despite all the action. They both laugh.


EXT. MORNINGBIRD LANE - DECEMBER / EARLY EVENING

The street is BURIED UNDER A FOOT OF SNOW now, all lit up for
the holidays. CHRISTMAS LIGHTS, NATIVITY SCENES, PLUG-IN
MENORAHS glowing in windows.

The Simons is the only dark house on the block. Out front,
Moose finishes SHOVELING THEIR WALKWAY before he loses the
light, the last house on his route.


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - SAME

Margaret watches from her bedroom window as he clears the
last bit of now, then slings the SHOVEL over his shoulder to
begin his walk home.


INT. SIMONS DINING ROOM - SAME

Barb sits at the table in her sweats and slippers, filling
out “HAPPY NEW YEAR” CARDS. She looks at her ADDRESS BOOK for
the next name on the list: “PAUL AND MARY HUTCHINS,” an OHIO
ADDRESS... HER PARENTS.

She pauses seeing it. Can’t help feeling a prick of sadness.
Then, on an IMPULSE she can’t explain, she reaches for a
BLANK CARD and scrawls out: “Dear Mom and Dad, I hope you’re
both well. Love, Barbara.” She stuffs it into an ENVELOPE,
licks and seals it before she can change her mind.

Margaret comes up behind her.

                    MARGARET
          What are you doing?

Barb turns around, startled. Then notices out the window
behind Margaret--

                    BARBARA
          Oh! The mailman. You’ve got your
          shoes on, will you run these out to
          him?
                                                        64.


Barb scoops up the stack. Margaret takes it, hurries out the
door.


EXT. SIMONS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

She rushes down the walkway, the MAILMAN already leaving.

                    MARGARET
          Just a second.

He turns around, waiting for her. She sprints down to hand
him the cards. Just as she does, she catches the name on the
top envelope: PAUL AND MARY HUTCHINS.

She freezes. Blinks.

                     MAILMAN
              (taking them)
          Thanks.

The mailman hands her the day’s MAIL in exchange.

                       MARGARET
          Thank you.

Margaret’s mind is still on card, until something even more
unusual catches her eye: A PIECE OF MAIL ADDRESSED TO HER.
Who in the world would send her a letter? She tears it open.

Come on over for a PARTY!

Norman Fisher’s 12th Birthday

Saturday December 20th, 5-7pm

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          Norman Fisher?

She rolls her eyes. What a let down.


INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

Barbara is reading the invitation now, Margaret scrounging in
the fridge, eating DELI MEAT from the package.

                    BARBARA
          Who’s Norman Fisher?

                    MARGARET
          No one. This weird kid in my class.
          I don’t why even he invited me, I
          barely know him.
                                                         65.


The PHONE RINGS. Margaret picks it up.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          Hello?

                    NANCY (O.S.)
          Did you get invited?

                    MARGARET
          Yeah, to Norman’s? You did too?

                    NANCY
          Everyone did. Janie and Gretchen
          and the whole class, even Philip
          Leroy.

                    MARGARET
          Even Laura Danker?

                    NANCY
          The whole class I said. My mom just
          talked to Norman’s mom who said
          it’s a big-deal dinner party, we
          have to dress up really nice.

                    MARGARET
          Really?

Margaret’s expression is somewhere between panicked and
thrilled. Her view of this party just changed dramatically.


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Margaret frantically scours her closet, searching for
something to wear, scared nothing is good enough.

In QUICK CUTS, we see EACH OF THE GIRLS GETTING READY:

They paint their fingernails, untangle costume JEWELRY,
squeeze into TIGHTS, spritz perfume, shampoo, blow-dry,
straighten, curl. They’re ON THE PHONE WITH EACH OTHER THE
ENTIRE TIME, anxiously comparing notes. (The images are in
direct contrast to the summer camp ones only months ago.
Female self-consciousness has arrived in its full shitty
glory.)


INT. BARBARA AND HERB’S MASTER BATHROOM - SAME

Margaret sits on the closed toilet seat in a BLUE VELVET
DRESS, her knee bouncing nervously as Barb curls her hair.
                                                        66.


                     MARGARET
              (looking in the mirror)
          This piece looks weird.

She points at a jagged curl sticking sideways. Barb tries to
flatten it down. It doesn’t work.

                    BARBARA
          There.

                    MARGARET
          It’s still doing it.

                    BARBARA
          Try licking your fingers and
          pushing it down, they’re gonna be
          here, you gotta put your shoes on.

Margaret scurries out of the bathroom, licking her fingers
and trying to fix the curl. Herb passes her in THE HALLWAY.

                    HERB
          Whoa whoa, who’s that showstopper?!

Margaret just rushes past him to her room, too nervous to
hear a compliment. He shrugs it off, knowing he’s superfluous
right now.


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

She hurries through the door, finds her KITTEN HEELS in the
closet, slips them on and crosses to the FULL LENGTH MIRROR
for a last look. She likes her hair. Likes her shoes. Likes
the dress. Then she looks at her chest. Frowns.

                    MARGARET
          God? Really? It’s already December
          and still nothing? Please, come on,
          I’m not even asking for that much,
          just something.

Just as she says that, an IDEA begins to form.


INT. MARGARET’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Margaret closes the door behind her, a little scared about
what she’s about to do. She opens the medicine cabinet, gets
out the BOX OF COTTON BALLS... Then stuffs 3 into each side
of her bra.

She turns to see herself in the mirror. Her eyes light up,
absolutely blown away by the improvement.
                                                          67.


                    MARGARET
          See. Three cotton balls. That’s all
          we’re even talking about.

SFX: Mrs. Wheeler’s CAR HORN. Nancy screaming Maaaargaret!
Margaret realizes it’s time to go. Reaches in her bra to take
out the cotton balls. Then...an IDEA. A radical one. She acts
on it: Walks out the door, taking the cotton balls with her.


EXT. SIMONS HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Barb and Herb wave goodbye from the front door.

                    BARBARA
          Thanks Jan!

                    HERB
          Have fun tonight! Go easy on the
          whiskey and cigars!

Margaret climbs into MRS WHEELER’S STATION WAGON, squeezing
in next to the GIRLS. She still can’t believe what she did.


EXT. NORMAN FISHER’S HOUSE    - A LITTLE LATER

A large, modern home.


INT. NORMAN FISHER’S HOUSE - SAME

MRS. FISHER (30’s) sequined party blouse, opens the door.

                    MRS. FISHER
          Girls, you look so pretty! Come in,
          come in, they’re all downstairs.

                     NANCY
              (laying it on)
          Lovely house, Mrs. Fisher.

They all follow Mrs. Fisher inside. Janie squeezes Margaret’s
arm, nervous for their big entrance.


INT. NORMAN FISHER’S CONVERTED BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

They clomp down the stairs to the PARTY. Streamers tacked up.
MUSIC playing. The boys have congregated one side of the
room, girls on the other.

Janie and Margaret exchange another look, not sure what
they’re supposed to do with themselves.
                                                           68.


                    MRS. FISHER
          Alright, that makes everyone,
          Norman.

Seeing this is his cue, Norman picks up a spoon, TAPS IT ON
HIS PUNCH GLASS. It’s too full and the punch sloshes out,
dribbling down his pants.

                    NORMAN
          Oops, uh, whoops.

He tries to sop it up with some cocktail napkins. His mother
gestures for him to forget the stain and focus on the speech.

                    NORMAN (CONT'D)
          Uh, I just wanted to say thank you
          all for coming tonight and I hope
          you enjoy the evening. My mom made
          beanie weenies. Please, help
          yourself.

Norman lifts the SERVING LID from A FANCY SILVER PLATTER to
reveal the BEANIE-WEENIES (CUT UP HOTDOGS FLOATING IN BAKED
BEANS). The kids peer at it wearily. Norman senses it.

                    NORMAN (CONT'D)
          Uh, there are sandwiches too... and
          nuts if, uh, you like nuts.

He points to the SANDWICHES and NUTS. Freddy Barnett grabs a
plate, goes for the beanie weenies. The rest of the kids
start to follow.

LATER--

Margaret, Janie, Gretchen and Nancy eat at a card table.

Margaret’s eyes are on Laura Danker, standing on the other
side of the room, the BOYS side, alone with her arms crossed.
Margaret can’t help feeling oddly fascinated by her.

                     JANIE
              (sees Margaret staring)
          I didn’t think she’d come, did you?

                    MARGARET
          How come she never talks to
          anybody...?

                    JANIE
          I don’t know...
                                                         69.


                     NANCY
                 (butting in)
          ‘Cause she’s too busy doing other
          stuff, that’s why.

Gretchen laughs. Good one.

                    NANCY (CONT'D)
          Whatever, all I care about is
          Philip Leroy came...

They all turn to look at Philip Leroy. He’s bent over,
sucking MUSTARD off his plate with a straw.

                     PHILIP LEROY
              (taps Freddy)
          Hey, watch this.

He aims the straw upwards, blows hard, making a BIG YELLOW
SPLOTCH on the ceiling. They both crack up. Nancy grins.

                    NANCY
          He’s hilarious.

Norman TAPS HIS PUNCH GLASS again.

                    NORMAN
          Okay, now if everyone’s had enough
          to eat, we can start the games.

                       GRETCHEN
          The games?

Everyone looks around. What kind of games?

CUT TO: An EMPTY BOTTLE LAID SIDEWAYS on the floor.

                    FREDDY
          Are you kidding Norman? This is the
          stupidest game ever.

                    NORMAN
          But it’s a classic.

                    NANCY
          Just play. Who spins first?

                    NORMAN
          I’ll go first since it’s my
          birthday. And my bottle.

Norman spins. All the girls get nervous, hoping it doesn’t
land on them. It lands on Janie.
                                                        70.


                     JANIE
              (sotto)
          No...

Margaret shoots her a sympathetic look.

                    FREDDY
          Ha ha! Norman and Janie have to
          kiss!!!

Janie swallows. Norman walks over, gives her a peck on the
cheek. Except he misses her face, gets her hair instead.

                    FREDDY (CONT'D)
          That doesn’t count, you kissed her
          hair!

                    MARGARET
          Oh it’s fine, it counts.

                    NORMAN
          No he’s right, I’ll do it again.

Janie looks sick. Norman does it again, connecting this time.

                    NANCY
          Okay, now Janie’s turn to spin.

Janie spins. It twirls and twirls. Then lands on...Norman
Fisher again. Everyone LAUGHS.

                    NORMAN
          This is a great party.

                    MARGARET
          Do we have to play this game?

                    FREDDY
          I said that from the beginning!

                    NANCY
          Fine, let’s play a different game.
          I have one. It’s called Two Minutes
          in the Closet.

                    MARGARET
          What’s that?

                    NANCY
          We all get a number, and then
          somebody calls, like, “number six”
          and then those two go in the closet
          and...you know...
                                                        71.


All the kids get a little nervous imagining this. Margaret
and Janie eye each other: Should we be doing this?

CUT TO: Nancy holds a BASKET OF LITTLE NUMBERED PAPERS, the
room tense with anticipation.

                       NANCY (CONT'D)
          Alright...

She holds the basket out to Freddy. He pulls one out.

                       FREDDY
          Number 3.

Everyone looks around to see who 3 is.

                    GRETCHEN
          Who’s number 3?

No one responds.

                    NANCY
          Hellooo? Somebody’s gotta be three.

Laura Danker slowly stands up. She towers over Freddy, her
chest at his eyeballs. Freddy turns bright red. Margaret
can’t believe it. Philip grins, slapping him on the back.

                    PHILIP
          Go ahead! Into the bathroom!

                    NANCY
          Hey somebody get Freddy a step
          stool!

Everyone LAUGHS. Margaret can’t take her eyes off Laura as
the two of them go into the BATHROOM. They close the door.
The whole room goes SILENT, listening.

                    GRETCHEN
          What do you think they’re--

                    EVERYONE
          SHHHHHH!!!!!!

Gretchen shuts up. A few seconds pass. Finally, the door
opens. Laura comes out, arms folded tightly over her chest,
flustered, Freddy behind her. Everyone HOOTS and CLAPS.
Freddy hands the basket to Philip, traumatized.

                    FREDDY
          You’re next.
                                                        72.


All the girls sit up, hoping Philip picks their number. Nancy
prays so hard she could burst.

                     PHILIP
          I pick number...
              (oh the suspense)
          12.

Nancy’s shoulders fall. Everyone looks around to see who 12
is. Margaret stares down at her number: 12.

                       MARGARET
          Oh my god.

                    NANCY
          What. You’re 12 Margaret?!

Margaret is still frozen. Philip does a crooked little smile
at her. All the girls burn with envy. Margaret slowly stands,
heart banging in her chest. The whole room watching intensely
as they head towards--


INT. NORMAN’S BASEMENT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Philip goes in first. Margaret follows, hardly able to
breathe. She slides the ACCORDIAN DOOR shut, all the kids
eyes on her until the last inch of it closes.

She’s about to turn around and face Philip when suddenly it
dawns on her: The cotton balls. Her eyes widen, her hands
reflexively fly up to her chest.

                    PHILIP
          Margaret, turn around.

She realizes where her hands are, quickly drops them. Nothing
she can do about it. She swallows, slowly turns around.

                       MARGARET
          Hey...

                       PHILIP
          Hey.

She gulps a gallon of saliva.

                    MARGARET
          Um, so, do we--

Before she can finish, his LIPS ARE ON HERS. She’s stunned,
completely unready. He pulls away, looks at her. Margaret
can’t move.
                                                        73.


Then he leans in again, kisses her a second time. This one is
LONGER and SLOWER. When he finishes, he grins, proud of that
one. Margaret is frozen in her spot. He walks past her OUT OF
THE BATHROOM.

Standing there alone, a shocked little smile forms on her
face. She looks down at her COTTON BALL BOOBS, then up at
God, grateful. The bathroom fills with PRE-LAPPED CHURCH
ORGAN MUSIC.


INT. NANCY’S PROTESTANT CHURCH - CHRISTMAS EVE

A LADY (90’s), thick glasses and puffed hair, hunches over
the CHURCH ORGAN, playing. Margaret watches from a pew, the
same goofy smile still on her face. Nancy is next to her,
sick with jealousy.

                    NANCY
          So he was a good kisser? Like
          really good?

                    MARGARET
          Each of ‘em were pretty good, yeah.

                    NANCY
          Each of them? So he kissed you more
          than once? Like how many times?

                    MARGARET
          Uh...about 5, I think? I kinda lost
          count...

Nancy looks miserable. Margaret can’t help but gloat.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          I know, God. I know. I shouldn’t be
          rubbing it in, especially here. But
          Nancy Wheeler is jealous of me. You
          gotta admit, it’s just too good.

Margaret shakes her head, amazed by her good fortune.


EXT. NEW JERSEY - FEBRUARY / DAY

Winter is fading. Just dirty patches of ICE now.


INT. SIMONS’ LIVING ROOM - SAME

Barb is still cutting out FELT STARS, starting to get really
sick of this task. She’s on the PHONE, trying to fundraise.
                                                        74.


                     BARBARA
          All donations are tax deductible
          and always go towards the school’s--
              (gets cut off)
          Oh. Uh, yeah. Okay, g’bye.

She hangs up. Cold-calling is not her strong suit.

Then, something OUTSIDE THE WINDOW catches her eye.

It’s A GOLDFINCH perched on a twig, yellow feathers catching
the light just so. The image is so beautiful it breaks
through something, reaches a place deep down inside her. On
instinct, she drops the scissors, hurries out to--


INT. SIMONS’ GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Barb runs to her BOXES OF ART STUFF, rushes to get a CANVAS,
EASEL, PAINT, PAINTBRUSH.


INT. SIMONS’ KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

She rushes back into the house. By the grace of God, the bird
is still there. She sets up the canvas as quickly as she can,
squeezes out a blob of PAINT, begins to make the first
delicate strokes, when--

DING DONG! The doorbell rings. The goldfinch startles, FLYING
OFF. Barb’s shoulders drop, genuinely disappointed. She sets
down her paint brush, crosses through the DEN, opens the
front door. Mrs. Wheeler is outside.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Hi Barbara! I just popped by to
          pick up your stars.

Mrs. Wheeler scans Barb’s appearance: undone hair, grubby
house clothes. Barb feels it, reflexively smooths her hair.

                    BARBARA
          Sorry, I’ve just been cleaning, uh,
          yeah I’ve almost finished them,
          please come in, sit down.

Mrs. Wheeler follows Barb into the DEN, looks for a place to
sit. But HERB’S LAWN CHAIR is still the only seat, now joined
by other make-shift furniture: an OVER-TURNED BUCKET as a
side-table, an UPSIDE-DOWN CRATE as a footstool.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Uh...
                                                          75.


                     BARBARA
                    (dying)
          Oh, pssh, would you believe it, I
          ordered new furniture 6 months ago,
          and they still haven’t sent it...

                    MRS. WHEELER
          It’s alright, I can’t stay long.

                    BARBARA
          I’ll get the stars.

Barb gets the HUMONGOUS BOX from the dining room.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Thanks... Oh, and don’t say
          anything, but Deb’s stars came out
          a teensy bit lopsided. Yours are so
          good, do you think you could do her
          allotment too, our little secret?

                    BARBARA
          Oh... Uh, Sure.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          You’re a doll, thanks. Well, gotta
          run, meeting the girls for Bridge.

Barb nods, walking Mrs. Wheeler out. She closes the door,
rolls her eyes at herself: God, what’s wrong with me, why
can’t I get it together?


INT. DELANO AUDITORIUM - DAY

ALL THE 6th GRADE GIRLS are gathered in the auditorium.

ON STAGE IN THE WING, MRS. WEBSTER (50’s) in a boxy gray suit
and orthopedic shoes, vigorously cleans her nostrils with a
handkerchief. Then stuffs it in her pocket, clears away some
throat phlegm, walks out ON STAGE.

                    MRS. WEBSTER
          Hello, girls, my name is Ms.
          Webster, and today I’m here to
          speak to you about your changing
          bodies...

A few GIGGLES in the crowd. Margaret and the girls look at
each other.

                     NANCY
                   (whispers)
          Toldja this was the big sex movie.
                                                         76.


                    MRS. WEBSTER
          Some of you may have already begun
          to experience these changes.

Everyone looks at Laura Danker. She lowers her head.

                    MRS. WEBSTER (CONT'D)
          While some others of you... still
          haven’t experienced a single change
          at all.

Margaret sinks down in her chair, sure all eyes are on her
now.

                    MRS. WEBSTER (CONT'D)
          We’re going to watch a short film
          to learn a little more.

The LIGHTS GO DOWN and THE FILM begins: Images of GIRLS
flashing on screen, all shapes, sizes, and colors. THE TITLE
CARD comes up: “What Every Girl Should Know”

                    NARRATOR (O.S.)
          All girls are different. But every
          girl has something in common.
          Between the ages of 9 and 16, her
          hips begin to fill out, her breasts
          become rounder and fuller, a soft
          growth of hair forms in her pubic
          area, and it is now that she begins
          to menstroo-ate.

An animated UTERUS and OVARIES appear.

                    NARRATOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Every month, a lining of blood
          forms in the uterus to prepare for
          pregnancy. If a baby is not
          conceived, the lining is released,
          flowing out of the body through the
          vagina.

The REACTIONS to the film vary dramatically: thrilled,
fascinated, grossed-out terror-stricken, exhilarated,
genuinely bereft.

                    NARRATOR (CONT'D)
          This...is menstroo-ation.

                     MARGARET
              (to Janie, imitating)
          Menstroooooooooo-ation.

Janie laughs.
                                                          77.


                     GRETCHEN
                    (whispers)
          Who do you think’ll get it first?

                    NANCY
          Who do you know’ll get it last?

Nancy eyes Margaret, laughing. Margaret folds her arms,
embarrassed and stung.


INT. MODERN FURNITURE STORE - LATER

Margaret follows Barb through ROWS OF MODERN JETSONS-LIKE
FURNITURE, still thinking about Nancy’s joke.

                     BARBARA
          It’s just I’ve wanted the house to
          look perfect and I’ve been so busy
          with the committees, and the stars,
          and trying to cook meals with all
          five food groups, which nobody
          tells you takes so long and is so
          boring, and you’ve gotta do it
          every...single...day...
              (sits in a CHAIR)
          Do you like this egg-chair? I feel
          like I’m on a space ship.

                    MARGARET
          When did you get your period?

Barb stops. Whoa. Left field.

                    BARBARA
          Oh... Uh...

She gets up from the chair, trying to transition herself into
a conversation she didn’t anticipate at this moment.

                    MARGARET
          Just tell me how old you were.

                     BARBARA
          I... 14?

                    MARGARET
          14?! That late?!

                    BARBARA
          That’s not that late, I had a
          cousin who was 16.
                      Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)              78.


                    MARGARET
          Oh my god, I’d kill myself! I’m
          definitely not waiting til I’m 16!

                     BARBARA
                    (laughs)
          Afraid you don’t have much say in
          the matter.

Margaret doesn’t see the humor. Barb glances around the
store, giving up the “modern” look. Just too weird for her.


INT. DELANO SCHOOL - MORNING

Margaret, Nancy, and Janie huddle over their MATH HOMEWORK,
cross-checking answers.

                    NANCY
          My mom’s taking me to The Rockettes
          next month ‘cause I got straight
          A’s, anyone wanna go? Only bad
          thing is my brother will be there
          with Moose.

                     MARGARET
               (immediately)
          I’ll go.

Nancy nods. Okay then. Gretchen runs up, breathless.

                      GRETCHEN
          I got it!

They all just look at her, confused.

                      MARGARET
          Got what?

                     GRETCHEN
              (lowers her voice)
          It. My period.

They all freeze. Holy shit.


INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM - LATER                                  *

An emergency meeting to discuss this development.

                    NANCY
          I can’t believe you got it first
          when I’ve got more than you.
                                                    79.


Nancy gestures to her Double A’s, feeling gypped.

                    GRETCHEN
          Well that doesn’t mean anything.

                    MARGARET
          Just tell us how it happened.

                    JANIE
          Yeah, start from the beginning.

                    GRETCHEN
          Well I was sitting there at dinner
          and I felt something dripping from
          me. So I went to the bathroom, and
          pulled down my pants, and that’s
          when I saw the blood. So I called
          my mom and showed her. But she only
          had tampons, no pads, so she had to
          run to the store.

                    JANIE
          What’d you do in the meantime?

                    GRETCHEN
          I stuck a washcloth in my pants.

                    NANCY
          Ew, no you didn’t!

                    GRETCHEN
          An old wash cloth. Not like one we
          use all the time.

                     MARGARET
              (moving this along)
          Okay, so go on, then what.

                    GRETCHEN
          So then my mom came home with the
          pads and I put one on, and,
          well...that was the whole thing.

                    NANCY
          The whole thing? You haven’t even
          told us the good stuff yet!

                    GRETCHEN
          I’ve told you everything.

                    NANCY
          But, like, what does it feel like?
                                                           80.


                    GRETCHEN
          It feels like... nothing. Sometimes
          like leaking? It doesn’t hurt. I
          had some cramps last night, not too
          bad. My cousin said it kinda has a
          smell, but I haven’t noticed it
          yet.

                    MARGARET
          It does? Like what?

                    GRETCHEN
          She said it kinda smells like the
          monkey bars.

                    NANCY
          The monkey bars?

They all look around, trying to remember that smell. Janie
looks suddenly grief-stricken.

                     JANIE
              (memory tainted forever)
          I used to love the monkey bars...

Margaret is mesmerized.

                    MARGARET
          Do you feel older now? Like more
          mature?

                     GRETCHEN
               (utterly sincere)
          Oh yeah. I don’t know how to
          explain it, and you won’t
          understand until you get it, but I
          feel like everything has changed
          for me. I just feel different.
                  (wistful)
          Yeah...

Margaret’s insides twist with envy, wishing so badly she
could feel that feeling.


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Margaret kneels at her bedside, hands clasped in prayer-pose,
vomiting out a prayer, top-speed.
                                                        81.


                     MARGARET
               (rapid-fire in one breath)
          Are you there God it’s me Margaret,
          I’ve never been so jealous in my
          life, I hate myself for being so
          jealous, I’m a decent person,
          please! Please let me grow, please
          let me get my period, please make
          me regular and normal and like
          everyone else, please please please
          please please please PLEASE!!!
                (finally exhales)
          Amen.

She lays back on her carpet, exhausted. Something in the room
catches her eye: THE LITTLE HANDMADE ANIMAL FIGURINES her
dresser. Their childishness suddenly make her sick. She
stands up, scoops them all up, drops them into a junk drawer,
slams it shut.


INT. DRUG STORE - DAY

ANGLE ON: A SHELF FULL OF MAXI PADS, TAMPONS, PANTY LINERS.
Reverse to see: Margaret and Janie stare intensely at it.

                    JANIE
          I don’t know if I want to do this.

                    MARGARET
          It’s not a big deal. It’s just so
          we’re ready, just in case.

But Margaret is extremely nervous too. She gathers her
courage, plucks a BOX off the shelf. Janie wills herself to
take one too.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          Okay. Come on.

They hurry towards THE REGISTERS.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          Please god let it be a lady...

They see the CASHIER: a SWEET LOOKING LADY (50’s). They
breathe a sigh of relief. Just then, a PIMPLY 17-YEAR-OLD BOY
changes shifts with her.

                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
              (sotto)
          Nooo.
                                                         82.


                    JANIE
          We can just put ‘em back.

Margaret pulls Janie towards the register, determined.

                    MARGARET
          No. We’re doing it.

They walk up, set their TWO BOXES OF PADS on the CONVEYER
BELT as casually as possible. The TEENAGE CLERK looks down at
the pads, then up at them. They fold their arms, look away.

He presses the button to roll the pads closer to him. It’s
THE SLOWEST CONVEYER BELT IN HISTORY.

Margaret and Janie watch, sweating, as the pads inch slowwwly
by. Margaret finally can’t take it, grabs some TIC TACS,
tosses them down with the pads so they aren’t alone.


EXT. DRUG STORE - MOMENTS LATER

Margaret and Janie burst out of the store, RUNNING AS FAST AS
THEY CAN AWAY FROM IT. It’s SNOWING outside.

They stop at the corner, out of breath. Look at each other,
traumatized. Janie suddenly begins to LAUGH.

                    JANIE
          The Tic Tacs...

Margaret shakes her head, LAUGHS too. It’s all so ridiculous.
They loop their arms around each other, heading home,
SNOWFLAKES floating down around them.


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - LATER

CLOSE UP ON: A MAXI PAD.

Margaret turns it over in her hands. Squishes it. Smells it.

REVEAL: She’s crouched INSIDE HER CLOSET with the door
closed.

She peels off the paper strip, touches the sticky part a
couple times. Then stands up, yanking down her pants. She
hunches over, carefully sticking the pad in place. Then pulls
up her pants again, WALKS OUT OF THE CLOSET.

She moves around the ROOM, feeling it out. Stretches, kicks,
squats. It feels like wearing a small diaper.

Suddenly there’s KNOCK and the DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
                                                           83.


                    BARBARA
          You got a post-card from someone.
          Who’s in D.C.?

Margaret stiffens in an awkward pose.

                    MARGARET
          Oh. Uh, Nancy. Must be from her.
          They went for Lincoln’s birthday.

Barb cocks her head a little, sensing something’s off with
Margaret. She lets it go, hands her the post card, exits.

When the door closes, Margaret flips it over. Nancy’s written
just 3 words: I GOT IT!

Margaret’s mouth drops open. Her mood plummets. In one
spontaneous flurry, she tears up the card, hurls the pieces
into the trash can, KICKS it over.


EXT. SYLVIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sylvia is in her nightgown, digging in her closet, a half-
packed SUITCASE open on her bed, along with BROCHURES for a
FLORIDA VACATION. The PHONE rings. She goes to get it.

                     SYLVIA
              (utterly elegant)
          Hello, Simon residence. Sylvia
          speaking.

                    MARGARET
          Grandma...?

She immediately knows something off in Margaret’s voice.

                    SYLVIA
          Margaret? What’s wrong?

Margaret is crouched on the floor of the BATHROOM, the door
shut, the PHONE CORD stretched as far as it will go.

                    SYLVIA (CONT'D)
          Honey...are you okay, what’s the
          matter?

It’s too hard to explain.

                    MARGARET
          I...I just miss you.

Sylvia clutches her heart. Then does a silent fist pump.
                                                        84.


                    SYLVIA
          Aw honey, me too...

                    MARGARET
          I’m coming to the city next week to
          see the Rockettes, do you think
          maybe I could come over after and
          stay the night like I did?

                    SYLVIA
          Oh sweetheart... I wish, but I’ll
          be in Florida then. I heard about
          this hotel... there’s a lot of
          people my age, and you know...

Sylvia doesn’t quite want to say she’s going on a vacation to
find friends, but she is. Margaret’s expression falls.

                    MARGARET
          Okay...

Sylvia feels rotten, hating to let her down.

                    SYLVIA
          Wait a minute, wait, what if you
          fly down to Florida and meet me for
          a few days? Isn’t your spring
          vacation soon?

                    MARGARET
          The end of the March.

                    SYLVIA
          Perfect! I’ll still be there!

Margaret perks up a little.

                    MARGARET
          I’ll ask my mom and dad.

                    SYLVIA
          Great, and--

                    MARGARET
          And I’ll tell them it was my idea.

                     SYLVIA
                (grins, touched)
          You’re my girl.

Margaret feels her spirits lifted a little.
                                                        85.


EXT. MORNINGBIRD LANE - EARLY EVENING

The sky is a pretty purple.


EXT. SIMONS HOUSE - SAME

The Wheeler’s STATION WAGON idles out front.

Margaret opens the door to get in. She’s dressed up, her hair
curled. MR. WHEELER (40’s)is behind the wheel in a suit, Mrs.
Wheeler is all dolled up in the passenger seat.

                    NANCY
          Hurry! Come on! Front row tickets!

Margaret scoots in. Looks back to see Moose sitting with Evan
in the THIRD ROW, which FACES BACKWARDS out the rear window.

                    MARGARET
          Hi...

Moose turns around, waves.

                    MOOSE
          Hey.

Margaret buckles in, the back of her head an inch from the
back of Moose’s. Physically closer than they’ve ever been,
but facing complete opposite directions. Their proximity
makes her feel a little tingly.


EXT. RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL - NIGHT

A SOLD OUT SHOW packed with TOURISTS.


INT. RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL - SAME

The LIGHTS GO DOWN as they find their seats in the FRONT ROW.
Margaret looks to see where Moose is sitting. He’s in the
FARTHEST SEAT AWAY. Bummer.

The CURTAIN OPENS. They all face forward as THE ROCKETTES run
out, burst into their BIG OPENING DANCE NUMBER. Margaret and
The Wheelers tilt their heads way back, the front row too
close to the stage. HIGH-HEELED LEGS swish past them, almost
too close for comfort, a view right up their skirts. Nancy
squeezes Margaret’s arm, giddy.
                                                        86.


INT. “THE STEAK PLACE” RESTAURANT - LATER

An upscale place. MAHOGANY and GREEN BANKER’S LAMPS. The
HOSTESS shows them to their seats, Nancy and Margaret still
singing the music from the show.

                     NANCY
          I’ll bet you a dollar I can kick
          that high.

                     MR. WHEELER
              (as she starts to try)
          Uh-uh. Not in the restaurant.

Nancy makes a face. He’s such a stick in the mud.

They come to a LARGE ROUND TABLE. Margaret is smarter this
time, strategically maneuvering into THE SEAT NEXT TO MOOSE.
He puts his napkin on his lap. She does too.

LATER-- The group is half-way through dinner. As Moose cuts
his steak, his hand bumps Margaret’s.

                    MOOSE
          Sorry.

                    MARGARET
          That’s okay.

He drinks the last sip from his WATER GLASS.

                     MOOSE
               (looks around)
          Is the waiter anywhere.

                    MARGARET
          Oh you can have mine, I didn’t
          drink out of it.

She scoots her WATER towards him. He thanks her, takes a big
drink, then looks at her a moment, realizing something.

                    MOOSE
          Hey, you know something I’ve always
          liked about you Margaret?

                    MARGARET
          No...?

Whatever it is, she cannot wait to hear it.
                                                        87.


                     NANCY
                 (interrupts)
          Come with me, I gotta go the
          bathroom.

She tugs Margaret away, killing their moment.

                    NANCY (CONT'D)
          We’ll be right back.
                 (to Evan)
          Don’t touch my food.

Margaret reluctantly follows Nancy, frustrated.


INT. “THE STEAK PLACE” BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

The SOUND of Nancy peeing in the stall. Margaret waits at the
sink, annoyed.

                    NANCY (O.S.)
          I’ve had to go bad since we got
          here and then I drank two Cokes.

                       MARGARET
          Uh huh.

Margaret folds her arms, impatient. Then--

                    NANCY
          Oh no. Oh no.

                       MARGARET
          What?

Nancy’s tone is panicked.

                    NANCY
          Oh please... Oh no...

                    MARGARET
          Nancy? Are you okay? What’s the
          matter?

Margaret walks over to the stall.

                    NANCY
          Get my mom. Please, quick!

Margaret tries to open the stall door, worried. It’s locked.

                       MARGARET
          Let me in.
                                                         88.


                    NANCY
          No, please, just get my mom.

                    MARGARET
          What’s wrong?

                     NANCY
               (starting to cry)
          PLEASE! Just go get my mom, please!

Margaret can tell this is something really serious.

                    MARGARET
          Okay, don’t worry, I’ll be right
          back with her!


INT. “THE STEAK PLACE” RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Margaret races over to Mrs. Wheeler.

                    MARGARET
          Something’s wrong. Nancy’s crying,
          she needs you!

Mrs. Wheeler drops her fork, stands, alarmed. Evan, Moose,
and Mr. Wheeler look at each other. WTF?

Evan shrugs it off, reaches over and forks Nancy’s REMAINING
STEAK, moving it to his own plate.


INT. STEAK HOUSE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Margaret and Mrs. Wheeler stand outside Nancy’s stall.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Nancy?

                    NANCY
          Oh please mom, help me! Please.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          The door’s locked, Nancy, I can’t
          get in. You have to unlock it.

                     NANCY
                 (crying)
          I can’t-- I can’t--

                    MARGARET
          You want me to crawl under and open
          it from the other side?
                                                           89.


Mrs. Wheeler nods. Margaret gathers her skirt up, crawls
under.

INSIDE, Nancy sits on the toilet, her face buried in her
hands. Margaret unhooks the lock, pushes the door open.

                       MRS. WHEELER
          Thank you.

Margaret goes over to wait by the sinks, worried.

                    MRS. WHEELER (CONT'D)
          Nancy, calm down. I can’t help you
          if you don’t stop crying and talk
          to me.

Nancy chokes back her tears, finally WHISPERS SOMETHING.

                     MRS. WHEELER (CONT'D)
               (understands)
          Ahh...

After a moment, Mrs. Wheeler cracks open the stall door.

                     MRS. WHEELER (CONT'D)
          Margaret? Would you get Nancy a pad
          please?
              (hands her a COIN)
          From that dispenser on the wall?

Margaret just stands there, confused.

                    MRS. WHEELER (CONT'D)
          Nancy got her period, honey.

                    MARGARET
          Does she always act like that?

                    MRS WHEELER
          It’s her first time. She’s just a
          little scared.

Margaret suddenly realizes Nancy was lying about her period.

She gets the PAD from the dispenser, gives it to Mrs.
Wheeler.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Thank you, sweetie.

After a moment, Nancy and Mrs. Wheeler come out of the stall.
                                                         90.


                    MRS WHEELER
          You wash up girls, I’m going to go
          tell the others not to worry. Don’t
          be long, okay?

She leaves. Nancy looks at Margaret, not sure what to say.
They wash their hands in silence.

                    NANCY
          Margaret, please don’t tell.

                    MARGARET
          Oh Nancy...

                    NANCY
          I’ll die if you tell Gretchen and
          Janie. Just please don’t tell them.
          I’ll... I’ll do something for you
          back. What do you want? I’ll do it.

                    MARGARET
          Ugh, Nancy... I won’t tell them.

                    NANCY
          Really, you won’t?

                    MARGARET
          No... Don’t worry.

Nancy exhales, relieved. Margaret doesn’t know how to feel.


INT. THE WHEELERS’ STATION WAGON - LATER THAT NIGHT

Margaret and Nancy ride back, sitting far apart.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          Are you there God? It’s me,
          Margaret.

Margaret glances over at Nancy, then stares out her window,
lets out a SIGH.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          I don’t even know what to say.

The station wagon gets on the TURNPIKE back to New Jersey.


EXT. NEW JERSEY - MARCH / MORNING

SPRING now. Grass and flowers fighting their way back.
                                                           91.


INT. MARGARET’S BATHROOM - SAME

Margaret raises her arm, sniffing her armpit. She doesn’t
smell anything. She’s almost a little disappointed. She yanks
the LID off a NEW STICK OF DEODORANT, applying it anyway.

                    BARBARA (PRE-LAP)
          Happy Birthday.


INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - SAME

Barb and Herb watch as Margaret opens her GIFT: A PLANE
TICKET TO FLORIDA.

                     MARGARET
          No way, I’m going to Florida?
                   (they nod)
          Thank-you-thank-you-thank-you.

She hugs them both, so relieved to finally have something
good happen in her life. She needs this trip, bad.


INT. MR. BENEDICT’S CLASS - LATER THAT MORNING

Margaret walks into class, sees ALL THE DESKS HAVE BEEN
REARRANGED.

                    MARGARET
          What...? Why do we have new seats?

She looks over at Janie, who’s holding a BALLOON and RECORD
ALBUM wrapped in a BOW.

                    JANIE
          He said we’re in groups now. To
          study different countries.

They look traumatized to be separated.

                    JANIE (CONT'D)
          Well, happy Birthday.

Janie hands her a RECORD ALBUM, trying to lift the mood.

                    MARGARET
          Aw, thanks...

They hug, but it still feels like a somber occasion. Margaret
looks around to find her new seat. Sees her name in the
“BELGIUM” group. Right beside Norman Fisher. She rolls eyes.
Of course. She sits down next to him. He smiles. He inches
her chair away.
                                                          92.


Just then, Laura Danker takes the seat across from her.
Margaret can’t believe her bad luck. Seriously, God?

There’s one seat left. Who will it be? She sees Philip Leroy
stroll up. She perks up, everything suddenly better.

                     PHILIP
              (sees the present)
          Happy Birthday.

                    MARGARET
          Oh. Thanks.

She smiles. Philip PINCHES her hard on the arm.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          Ouch!

                    PHILIP
          That’s a pinch to grow an inch. And
          you know where you need that inch.

He gestures at her flat chest. Margaret blinks, shocked,
stung, pissed. Philip grins at Laura, checking out her boobs.


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - LATER

Margaret bursts into her room, hurls down her backpack.

                     MARGARET
          Are you there God, it’s me,
          Margaret! I hate Philip Leroy! I
          hate him! I hate Laura Danker, too,
          with her great big chest “oooh look
          at me everyone, I’m wearing a
          sweater!” I hate Nancy, that liar,
          and Mr. Benedict with his dumb
          ideas, and Norman Fisher, the way
          he reads with his lips flapping all
          around!
              (imitates Norman’s silent
               reading, his lips moving
               like crazy)
          Please, please, just hurry up and
          get me to Florida!

She crumbles onto her bed, spent.


EXT. SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY

A cloudy day, the sky threatening to rain.
                                                         93.


INT. DELANO SCHOOL LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

Margaret and Laura are surrounded by BOOKS ON BELGIUM.
Margaret is in a truly awful mood.

                    MARGARET
          Philip and Norman should be here.
          They make us do all the work.

Laura doesn’t say anything, just keeps working.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          What time’s your mom picking you
          up?

                    LAURA
          Not ‘til later. I have to go to St.
          Thomas for Confession first.

                    MARGARET
          Confession?

Laura regrets telling her that.

                    LAURA
          It’s just something you have to do
          when you’re Catholic.

                    MARGARET
          What do you confess?

                    LAURA
          Things.

                    MARGARET
          What kinds of things?

Laura gives her a look.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          Never mind.

Margaret jots down some more info on Belgium. Laura sees what
she’s writing.

                    LAURA
          You’re just copying that straight
          out of the World Book.

                    MARGARET
          I only copied four words.
                                                94.


                    LAURA
          So. You can’t do that. We’re
          supposed to write it in our own
          words.

                    MARGARET
          It’s four words. “Germany”
          “invaded” “Belgium” “when”...

                    LAURA
          You’re still cheating. Mr. Benedict
          will know if you’re cheating.

                    MARGARET
          I’m not cheating! Jeez, quit acting
          like you know everything and are so
          great!

                    LAURA
          This has nothing to do with being
          great.

                    MARGARET
          Whatever. I know all about the
          stuff you do...

                    LAURA
          What’s that supposed to mean?

The LIBRARIAN (70’s) looks up from her post.

                    LIBRARIAN
          Quiet, girls.

                     MARGARET
                  (whispers)
          I heard about you and Moose Freed.

                    LAURA
          What about me and Moose Freed?

                    MARGARET
          Oh about how you and Evan and Moose
          go behind the A&P.

                    LAURA
          Why would I do that?

                    MARGARET
          I don’t know why you do it, but I
          know why they do it -- so they can
          feel you or something and you let
          them!
                                                        95.


Laura slams her book shut, stands up.

                    LAURA
          You’re a liar! You’re lying!

                    MARGARET
          I’m not lying.

                    LAURA
          You’re just like Nancy. All you do
          is pick on people and make up
          stories! You think I don’t know
          about you and your friends?!

Laura grabs her backpack, hurries towards the exit. It
suddenly hits Margaret that Nancy might’ve lied about Laura
too. She gathers her stuff up.


EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

                    MARGARET
          Laura, wait. Wait up.

Laura won’t turn around, just keeps walking.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          Please.

Margaret finally catches up with her.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          Laura, listen---

                    LAURA
          You think I don’t know you all make
          fun of me like it’s some kind of
          game?!

Margaret doesn’t know what to say.

                    LAURA (CONT'D)
          You think I want to be the biggest
          kid in class?

                    MARGARET
          I don’t know...

                    LAURA
          How would you feel if you had to
          wear a bra in 4th grade and
          everybody called you names just
          because of how you look?!
                                                           96.


                    MARGARET
          I’m sorry, Laura...

Laura’s throat tightens.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          If you want the truth, I wish I
          looked more like you than me.

Laura turns away, walking off again, not wanting Margaret to
see her cry.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          Laura, wait. I really am sorry.

Laura runs up the steps of the CATHOLIC CHURCH, disappears
inside, leaving Margaret alone on the sidewalk. Margaret
stands there a moment, feeling awful. Not sure what to do.
She heads up the steps, following Laura into the church.


INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

It’s dim, with towering stain glass windows. Margaret looks
around. No sign of Laura. She slowly makes her way down the
aisle, peering up at the ceiling, a mile high, feeling very,
very small in this place.

Her eyes wander to the BURNING PRAYER CANDLES. Then to a
STATUE OF MOTHER MARY, staring down at her, arms
outstretched, as if to gently scoop her up.

The SOUND of a DOOR CREAKING OPEN. She spins around to see
Laura coming out of the CONFESSION BOOTH. Margaret ducks
behind a pew, watching Laura cross the sanctuary and leave.

She stands again, stares for a moment at the small door Laura
came out of. She begins to move towards it, step by step,
until she’s right there in front of it. Then slowly,
anxiously, she opens it to see what’s inside.

A dark, empty space the size of a phone booth. Margaret
debates a moment, then decides to go in. She sits on the
small stool, pulls the door shut. She looks around the tiny
space, her breath held tight in her chest. Is this where God
is? In here?

                      MARGARET
                    (whispers)
          God...?

She waits for something to happen. A Presence to arrive. Or a
feeling. Something real and true and unmistakable.
                                                        97.


                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Yes, my child.

Margaret STARTLES, not expecting that.

A SHADOW shifts beyond the screen beside her and she realizes
a PRIEST is there. Her eyes dart around, not sure what to do.

                    PRIEST
          Do you have something you’d like to
          confess?

Margaret has no idea how to bare her soul to another person
the way she does to God.

                     MARGARET
          Um, I... I... I did something
          awful...
              (then)
          I...I’m sorry...

She can’t do it. Flings open the confessional door, runs out.


EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

Margaret hurries down the church steps, spilling her heart,
confessing. It’s beginning to LIGHTLY RAIN.

                    MARGARET
          I’m the worst person who ever
          lived, God. I picked on Laura
          Danker just because I felt mean.
          Why did I do that? I’ve been
          looking for you, God. I looked for
          you in Temple, I looked for you in
          Church, and I looked for you just
          now when I went to confess. You
          weren’t there. I didn’t feel you at
          all. Why God? Why do I only feel
          you when I’m alone?

She sighs, defeated by herself.


EXT. SIMONS HOUSE   - SAME

Barb runs to get the MAIL in the RAIN.


INT. SIMON’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

As she steps into the foyer, she sees the RETURN ADDRESS on
one of the letters: PAUL AND MARY HUTCHINS, Ohio.
                                                        98.


She stops. Her spirit melts right out of her body. She opens
the letter, shaking as she reads it.


INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - LATER

Barbara waits as Herb READS the letter.

                     HERB
          “Dear Barbara, your card felt like
          an answer to prayer. Your father
          and I have been thinking about you
          a lot. We’re getting older, and
          suddenly, more than anything, we’d
          like to see our only daughter and
          finally get to know our
          granddaughter, Margaret Ann. We’re
          flying east next week, April 20th.
          We sincerely hope you’ll let us
          visit. Love, your mother Mary
          Hutchins.”

Herb sets it down, slowly peels off a pair of reading
glasses. Barb waits, breath held, for his response. For the
first time, he is not his jovial self.

                    HERB (CONT'D)
          You sent them a card.

She lowers her voice, a little embarrassed.

                    BARBARA
          I...I don’t know why.

She really doesn’t. Herb gets to his feet, begins to pace,
trying to keep a lid the swell of emotions rising up.

                    HERB
          Do you remember that first year
          after they “cast” you out? What
          that was like for you? The way you
          felt?

                    BARBARA
          I know... And the way they treated
          you... I’m sorry.

                    HERB
          You really want to open that door
          again? We have a good life, we’re
          happy, is it worth it?

Barbara genuinely considers this question.
                                                        99.


                     BARBARA
              (quietly, simply)
          They’re my parents.

Herb slowly inhales and exhales, accepting it even though he
doesn’t like it. Barb reaches for his hand, knowing this
can’t be easy for him.

Margaret walks through the FRONT DOOR, registers the energy
in the room.

                    MARGARET
          What’s going on?

Barb and Herb exchange a look about how to handle this. Herb
makes a decision--

                    HERB
          Margaret should know.

                    MARGARET
          Know what? What is this?

                     HERB
              (hands her the letter)
          It’s from your mom’s parents. It
          concerns you.

Margaret looks at Barb, she takes the letter, quietly reads
through it as Herb and Barb wait. Then:

                    MARGARET
          They’re coming here next week?

Barbara nods.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          I won’t be here, I’ll be in
          Florida.

Barb doesn’t say anything. Herb looks down.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          What? I’m still going to Florida,
          aren’t I?

                    BARBARA
          Margaret, look...

                    MARGARET
          I can’t go to Florida now?! But I
          don’t even want to see them! I want
          to see Grandma!
                                                       100.


                    HERB
          We promise you’ll go to Florida
          another time...

                    MARGARET
          I don’t want to go another time!
          Does Grandma know about this?!

                    BARBARA
          No, we need to call her.

                    MARGARET
          I’m not calling her, you can do it
          yourselves!

Barbara tries to calm her down, defuse this.

                     BARBARA
                 (softly)
          Alright. Alright. I’ll call her
          now.

Barb goes over to the PHONE, dials. Margaret cannot believe
this is really happening. Herb rubs his forehead, wishing it
wasn’t.


INT./EXT. SYLVIA’S FLORIDA CONDOMINIUM - SAME

Sylvia wears a BATHING SUIT and SARONG. She carries a CHEESE
PLATE out to her VERANDA, setting it down in front of MORRIS
BINAMIN (70’s) a good-looking white-haired gentleman pouring
them each a GLASS OF WHITE WINE.

She’s uncharacteristically nervous. Yanks at her bathing suit
top a little, worried about her cleavage.

                     SYLVIA
              (trying to be elegant)
          Here we are...

Mr. Binamin smiles, he raises his glass, toasting to their
little date.

                    MR. BINAMIN
          This looks wonderful.

The PHONE RINGS inside.

                     SYLVIA
          One moment...
                 (before she goes in)
          Don’t eat all the cheese without
          me.
                     (MORE)
                                                       101.

                    SYLVIA (CONT'D)
          Just kidding, eat at much as you
          want! Depending on your
          cholesterol! I’m just being funny
          I’m not asking what it is! But I’m
          sure it’s low!

She laughs nervously, then turns around, making a face at
herself for being insane around him. She answers the phone.

                    SYLVIA (CONT'D)
          Simon Residence.

                    BARBARA
          Sylvia, it’s Barb. Look, um...

Barb struggles for how to begin. Margaret can’t take it, goes
over and yanks the phone away.

                    MARGARET
          Just give it to me, I’ll tell her.
          Hello Grandma?

                    SYLVIA
          Tell me what.

                    MARGARET
          That I... that I can’t come to
          Florida.

Margaret hates hearing herself say those words. Sylvia’s
expression falls.

                    SYLVIA
          What. What do you mean?

                    MARGARET
          We got a letter that my other
          grandparents are coming.

Sylvia’s posture changes.

                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
              (getting choked up)
          I just really wanted to see you...

                    SYLVIA
          Put your mother back on the line.

Margaret hands the phone to Barb.

                    SYLVIA (CONT'D)
          Barbara, what the hell’s going on?
                                                       102.


                    BARBARA
          I’ll explain later Sylvia, it’s
          just one of those things, I hope
          you can understand. I’ve gotta go.

Barb hangs up before Sylvia can protest.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Margaret, I’m sorry...

Margaret heads up the stairs, upset. Barb looks at Herb,
feeling bad for him too.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          I’m sorry...

He puts up his hands. It is what it is. She looks at their
EMPTY DEN, suddenly realizing she’s also completely
unprepared for having her parents.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Oh god. And this.


EXT. TRADITIONAL STYLE FURNITURE STORE - DAY

Barb heads up the sidewalk, Margaret reluctantly following.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          Are you there God? It’s Me,
          Margaret. I’m absolutely miserable.
          Everything is just going to crap.
          Maybe this is my punishment for
          being a horrible person to Laura
          Danker.

On their way into the store, Barb notices A GOOD-LOOKING
COUPLE staring at a FANCY FURNITURE SET IN THE STORE WINDOW.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          Please, right now, just do this one
          thing for me, I’m begging you: make
          something happen so they don’t come
          and I can still go to Florida.


EXT. NEW JERSEY AIRPORT - DAY

The PLANE lands, her grandparents arriving.
                                                       103.


EXT. NEW JERSEY AIRPORT TARMAC - A LITTLE LATER

Margaret has a bitter, cheerless expression as she and Barb
wait for her grandparents to de-board a PARKED PLANE. Barb
wears a stiff tailored dress unlike anything else she owns,
her stomach in knots. She looks over at Margaret.

                    BARBARA
          Please Margaret. Even if it’s fake,
          can you just try to look happy? Or
          least not so unhappy?

                    MARGARET
          Why do you even want to see them?
          After what they did to you?

                    BARBARA
          Because I...I want them to see how
          great we turned out. How proud I am
          of our family...

Margaret just looks away. Every bit of this is unfair. Barb
suddenly spots her parents. Her stomach drops.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          That’s them.

Margaret looks over to see them coming down the PLANE’S
STAIRS. MARY HUTCHINS (70’s), soft white hair, ruffled
blouse, black orthopedic shoes. PAUL HUTCHINS (70’s), plaid
shirt, suspenders, the identical shoes as Mary.

Barb feels a jolt of emotion seeing how much they’ve aged.
She breathes it away.

                     BARBARA (CONT'D)
              (waving them over)
          HERE WE ARE, OVER HERE.

The Hutchins look up, coming over towards them.

                     BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Hi...

                     PAUL
          Hello...

Barb doesn’t know whether to hug them. The moment to decide
passes.

                    BARBARA
          It’s good to see you.
                                                          104.


                    MARY
          You too, Barbara. And this must be
          Margaret Ann...?

Margaret pastes on a smile, trying to be polite.

                      MARGARET
          Hi.

                    MARY
          We’re very glad to meet you.

Mary gives her a stiff kiss on the forehead. Margaret tenses
as she does. Paul just sticks with a pat on the back.

                    PAUL
          Yes we are.

Barb tries to act breezy.

                    BARBARA
          Well, should we get the bags?
          Herb’s got the car running.


EXT. AIRPORT PARKING LOT / LOADING ZONE - A LITTLE LATER

Herb waits by their idling Chrysler in a shirt and slacks, a
fresh haircut. He sees them approaching.

                      HERB
          Hi there.

Herb smiles, anxious but trying to be his affable self.

                    BARBARA
          Hey. Mom, dad, you remember Herb...

                    PAUL
          Hello, Herb.

Paul puts out his hand. Herb shakes it.

                    HERB
          Hi Paul. Mary, how are you?

                    MARY
          Just fine, thank you for having us.

                     HERB
                (nods politely)
          Well, welcome to scenic New Jersey.
                                                          105.


Herb gestures to their SHITTY SURROUNDINGS, making a joke.
Paul and Mary take him as sincere, look around to take in the
scenery, nodding. Herb gives Barb a look. Margaret cringes a
little.


INT. SIMON’S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

They all come through the front door, Herb carrying Paul and
Mary’s bags.

                    BARBARA
          Here we are, make yourselves
          comfortable...

She leads them into the LIVING ROOM, now furnished with the
SET FROM THE STORE WINDOW. Mary nods in approval.

                    MARY
          Lovely home.

Barb smiles, relieved.

                    BARBARA
          Margaret can show you to your room.
          I’ll just start getting dinner
          ready.

Barbara looks at Margaret to take them upstairs. She doesn’t
want to, but goes along.

                    MARGARET
          Up this way...

                    MARY
          Thank you. Gosh, you look like your
          mom when she was your age.

                    PAUL
          Yes you do. And I’ll bet you’re
          smart just like her too.

They’re being so nice, it’s hard to be mad at them. She
softens a little.

                    MARGARET
          Oh. Uh. Thanks.


INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - SAME

Barb opens a CAN OF CAMPBELL’S CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP,
dumping the grey gelatinous blob onto a RAW CHUCK ROAST.
                                                       106.


She checks the RECIPE. That’s it, just one ingredient. She
can’t mess it up. Herb comes up behind her, checking on her.

                    HERB
          How are you doing?

                    BARBARA
          How are you doing?

                    HERB
          I make small talk for a living and
          I’m already out of material. Help.
          Sports teams? TV shows they used to
          like?

                    BARBARA
          I don’t know. Game shows mostly?

Herb files it away. Then: DING DONG, the DOORBELL rings. They
both look at each other. Who could that be?


INT. SIMONS LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Herb opens the door. SYLVIA AND MR. BINAMIN are on the porch.

                    HERB
          Mom?

                    SYLVIA
          This plant is dying from too much
          water.

She points to a YELLOWING PLANT on their front step. Barbara
comes around, freezes.

                    BARBARA
          Sylvia? What’s going on?

                    SYLVIA
          Margaret said she needed to see me,
          so we flew here from Florida. Are
          your parents here yet? This is
          Morris Binamin.

                    MORRIS BINAMIN
          Rhymes with cinnamon.

Sylvia smiles casually, as if this isn’t the slightest bit
nuts. Barb is speechless. So is Herb.

Margaret comes downstairs with her grandparents, sees Sylvia.
                                                       107.


                     MARGARET
          Grandma?

                    SYLVIA
          There’s my girl!

Margaret runs down to hug her. Sylvia makes a big show of it
for Barbara’s parents’ benefit. Paul and Mary aren’t sure
what’s going on.

                     MARY
          Uh...

Barb just throws up her hands.

                    BARBARA
          Mom and Dad: Sylvia. Sylvia: Paul
          and Mary.


INT. SIMONS’ DINING ROOM - LATER

They all sit around the dinner table. Sylvia is on one side
of Margaret, Mary on the other. Everyone is trying to be on
their best behavior.

                    SYLVIA
          Dinner is delicious. What is it
          made of?

                     BARBARA
          Soup.

                     SYLVIA
          Ah.

                     MARY
              (nodding)
          Very nice.

Everyone agrees it’s great. Margaret nods too.

                     BARBARA
          Well, I’ll admit it was a bit of a
          jolt, but...it’s nice to have us
          all together. The whole family.
              (then)
          And Mr. Binamin.

They all look at Mr. Binamin. He smiles.

                     SYLVIA
              (Raises her glass to that)
          L’chaim.
                                                       108.


Barb and Herb both react to the Hebrew.

                     SYLVIA (CONT'D)
              (toasts everyone 1-by-1)
          L’chaim. L’chaim. L’chaim. L’chaim.

Sylvia puts the glass down and nobody can think of what to
say for a second. Herb turns to Paul and Mary.

                    HERB
          See that young kid on Jeopardy?


INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - LATER

Barb and Herb clean up from dinner, relieved to have a break
from the group.


INT. SIMONS LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Margaret sits on the couch opposite Paul and Mary. Sylvia and
Morris are on the other side of the room, helping themselves
to some ICE TEA and a TRAY OF DESSERT COOKIES.

                    MARY
          There’s just so much we want to get
          to know about you, Margaret...

                    PAUL
          12 years is a lot to catch up on.

They look at her with a genuine longing for the years they
missed. Margaret can feel their sincerity.

                    MARGARET
          Yeah... Long time...

                    PAUL
          We were wondering if you go to
          Sunday School? Or have ever thought
          about it?

Margaret’s smile falters, not expecting that. Sylvia
overhears it, interjects.

                    SYLVIA
          Nope. Never. Not once.

Mary smiles tersely at Sylvia, staking her own territory now.

                    MARY
          We asked Margaret the question.
          Margaret?
                                                         109.


Margaret couldn’t look more uncomfortable.

                    SYLVIA
          You’re wasting your time, Margaret
          already went to Temple. She’s
          Jewish.

Margaret looks over at Sylvia. Herb and Barb walk in from the
kitchen to hear this. Can’t believe their ears.

                       BARBARA
          Excuse me?

                     HERB
                  (sternly)
          Mom, that’s it. Cut it out. You’re
          done here.

                    SYLVIA
          I’m done? You left the room and
          they’re trying to convert her!

                    PAUL
          Margaret has a right to be baptized
          if she wants to be.

                       BARBARA
          Baptized?

Barbara can’t believe they’re doing this. Margaret sinks down
in her seat, desperately wanting out of this room. Herb
finally has enough, seizes control.

                    HERB
          This discussion is over. No more.
          We are her parents and Margaret
          will pick her own religion when she
          grows up, if she even wants one.

                    SYLVIA
          Except she already did and she’s
          Jewish.

                    MARY
          Well she’s Christian in our eyes.

                    HERB
          MARGARET IS NOTHING. MARGARET IS NO
          RELIGION UNTIL MARGARET DECIDES
          THAT MARGARET--

As they argue, we push in on Margaret’s face. Finally,
something vital inside her BREAKS.
                                                          110.


                     MARGARET
               (bursts to her feet)
          Stop it! Stop it! I don’t care
          anymore! I don’t care! I don’t want
          a religion anyway! It’s all stupid,
          I hate it! I don’t even believe in
          God!

All the adults shut up, stunned.

Margaret rushes out of the room, hurries UP THE STAIRS.


INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM   - CONTINUOUS

She throws her DOOR shut, about to give God a piece of her
mind. Then stops, realizing it’s useless anyway. He’s not
even there.


INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The adults just stand there, regretting how that went, no one
sure what to say now.


EXT. MORNINGBIRD LANE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Dark now. The glow of street lights.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          Dear Mr. Benedict...

Barb and Herb see Sylvia and Mr. Binamin off in one TAXI, her
parents off in another. Everyone seems exhausted. Sylvia
looks apologetically at Mr. Binamin, worried her family drama
turned him off. He pats her reassuringly.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          I finished my year-long study of
          religion.

Barb and Herb watch both cabs drive off down the street. Barb
sighs. Herb loops an arm around her: Well, just us again.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          I went to a Jewish Temple, a
          Presbyterian church, a Protestant
          church, and a Catholic church.
                                                       111.


INT. MARGARET’S ROOM - NIGHT

Margaret switches on a SMALL DESK LIGHT, pulls some PAPER and
a PEN out of her DRAWER, begins to write.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          What I learned about religion is
          that it makes people fight. And
          that every religion says the same
          thing: If you pray to God, he’ll
          listen to you, and help you, and
          make things better. But I’ve prayed
          and prayed, and everything just
          gets worse. I don’t know anymore,
          but I think--

She hesitates, scared of what she’s about to write next.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          That maybe the truth is...
          There’s nobody even up there.
          There’s nobody listening.

Something empties out of her eyes.

                    MARGARET (V.O.)
          There’s only just me.


INT. RESIDENTIAL STREET   - DAY

Margaret walks to school by herself. She looks tiny. A tuft
of dust blowing down the road.


INT. MR. BENEDICT’S CLASS - DAY

Students drop BOUND BOOKLETS into Mr. Benedict’s INBOX.
Margaret waits at the edge of his desk as he finishes reading
her LETTER. He looks up at her, worried for her.

                    MR. BENEDICT
          Margaret...

A knot forms in her throat. She tries to swallow it away, but
can’t. She rushes out of the room before anyone see her cry.


INT. DELANO SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Margaret barrels down the hallway, trying to outpace her
emotions. A TEAR escapes. Then another. And another. She
starts to RUN, makes a turn into--
                                                        112.


INT. DELANO GIRLS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

She races by a GIRL AT THE SINK WASHING HER HANDS, ducks into
the last stall, shuts the door, crouches down next to the
toilet, THE TEARS COMING HARDER AND FASTER NOW.

She clamps a hand over her mouth, trying not to make a sound.
She SOBS -- a SILENT, shaking little heap.

The GIRL exits, the SOUND of the door shutting behind her.

Finally in private, Margaret unclamps her hand, lets herself
cry. She finishes and the bathroom becomes VERY STILL.

She pulls in a long, slow breath, steadying herself. Presses
her scrunch sleeves against her eyes to sop them up.

Finally, she rises to her feet, exiting to--


EXT. DELANO SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

As she comes out the door, the LUNCH BELL RINGS. HUNDREDS of
KIDS rush in from all directions. Margaret watches them for a
moment. Then folds in with the crowd, CARRYING ON.


EXT. MORNINGBIRD LANE - LATER THAT DAY

Sun sinking behind the trees.


INT. SIMONS’ DINING ROOM - SAME

CLOSE UP: The LATCH on the UNDERSIDE OF THE DINING ROOM TABLE
that holds in the EXTRA LEAF. Two FINGERS reach into frame,
popping it open.

Barb struggles to lift the HEAVY WOOD PIECE from the center
of the table, drags it across the carpet, leans it against
the wall.

She pushes the two side pieces back together to turn it back
into a SMALL ROUND TABLE. She stares at it a beat. Her own
family seemed to expand and contract just that fast.

She takes a slow breath, trying to be okay with that.

Behind her, the DOOR OPENS. Margaret walks in from school
with a tired, far-off expression. Barb can relate.

                    BARBARA
          Hi...
                                                         113.


Margaret nods hello, heads for the stairs.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Hey. Wait... Come’re.

                    MARGARET
          I don’t feel like talking.

                    BARBARA
          I know. I don’t either.

They just stand there.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          I’m sorry for how things went.
          And... I know this past year has
          not been easy.

Margaret doesn’t make eye contact. You got that right.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Wanna just sit for a minute?

Barbara gestures to the couch. Margaret isn’t sure. Barb
takes a seat, hoping she’ll follow. Margaret hesitates, then
joins her.

They sit quietly beside each other a moment. Barb looks over
at Margaret, Margaret looks over at her. The moment is ripe.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          I want to say something encouraging
          right now, but nothing’s coming to
          me.

Margaret cracks a tiny smile. Looks down. Barb’s heart aches
seeing her like this.

                     BARBARA (CONT'D)
                  (lovingly)
          It gets tiring trying so hard all
          the time, doesn’t it.

Margaret nods. Yes. Yes, it does. Barb nods back, knowing the
feeling well. She loops her arm around her. Their heads tip
together ever-so-slightly.


EXT. NEW JERSEY - JUNE / EARLY EVENING

Summer again. Trees swaying in a warm breeze. Emerald green
grass. Sprinkler mist sparkling in the sun.
                                                          114.


EXT. DELANO SCHOOL / 6TH GRADE FAREWELL CARNIVAL - SAME

GLOWING PAPER LANTERNS strung up over the blacktop. BOOTHS
set up with FOOD and GAMES.

Margaret leans together with Janie, Nancy, and Gretchen in
front of a “CONGRATS GRADUATES” PHOTO BACKDROP. She’s a
little better now, but something is missing from her smile.

MR. BENEDICT snaps their PICTURE.

                     NANCY
          Junior high, woo!!!
                  (then)
          Ooh the fish bowl game is open!
          Let’s go, come on, I’m going first!

Nancy breaks their huddle, takes off running. Gretchen and
Janie run after her. Margaret almost falls in with them, then
decides against it. She just can’t go along with Nancy’s ever
whim anymore.

                    MR. BENEDICT
          Doing ok, Margaret?

She looks over at Mr. Benedict. He’s checking in with her
after what happened.

                    MARGARET
          Yeah. Thanks, Mr. Benedict. You
          were a good 6th grade teacher.

                    MR. BENEDICT
          Oh, I don’t know about that. Still
          ironing out a lotta kinks...

But Margaret smiles, meaning it. Mr. Benedict bows his head,
the compliment getting in.

Someone TURNS UP the MUSIC on the stereo system. A BUNCH OF
KIDS make a run for the chalk-drawn DANCE FLOOR. Margaret
watches them dance for a moment.

Then something just beyond them catches her eye: LAURA
DANKER, standing by herself as always.

Margaret leaves Mr. Benedict, walks up to her.

                    MARGARET
          Hey.

Laura looks over, surprised someone’s talking to her.
                                                       115.


                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          You wanna come dance?

Laura hesitates, not sure if she’s for real. Margaret looks
at her, earnest. Laura weighs whether to trust it. She takes
the leap. They head over to the dance floor, start to dance
together.

OVER AT THE FISH BOWL GAME --

Nancy hogs the game, Gretchen nagging for a turn. Janie looks
around for Margaret. Spots her across the way, dancing with
Laura. Surprised, she watches them a sec. They look like
they’re having more fun than she is. She looks over at Nancy
and Gretchen bickering, decides to join Margaret and Laura.

The 3 of them DANCE in a little circle, at the beginning of
something...


EXT. SMALL ART SCHOOL - SAME

A small BRICK BUILDING nestled on MAIN STREET.


INT. SMALL ART SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE UP: A PAINTING OF A BOWL OF FRUIT, still in progress. A
YOUNG GUY adds a shadow under a pear.

                    BARBARA
          Nice job on the shading, you might
          try a wash to blend this area here.

The guy nods, grateful. Barb moves on to the next student.


EXT. SMALL ART SCHOOL / MAIN STREET   - LATER

Barb walks to her car after work. Mrs. Wheeler comes down the
sidewalk with some shopping bags.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Oh hey Barbara!

                    BARBARA
          Oh, hi Jan.

                    MRS. WHEELER
          I was just gonna call you! Could
          you believe it about the stars?
          Jeez, I guess everything’s a “fire
          hazard” these days.
                                                       116.


Mrs. Wheeler shakes her head at the dumb rule.

                     BARBARA
          Yeah...

                    MRS. WHEELER
          Anyway, listen, we’re already
          forming committees at the junior
          high and I can think of at least
          three you’d be perfect for if
          you’ll sign up?

Barb smiles, nods.

                    BARBARA
          Oh, yeah, that sounds great and I’d
          love to, but...

Beat. How does she put this?

                     BARBARA (CONT'D)
                (shrugs, warmly)
          ...I don’t want to.

Barb smiles again, apologetic. Mrs. Wheeler blinks, taken
aback by the honesty.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          I’ll see you later though, okay
          Jan?

Barb slides into her car, waving goodbye. As she spins around
to back out, she has a private moment celebrating her tiny
victory on the road to self-acceptance.


INT. SIMON’S KITCHEN - DAY

Margaret is on the PHONE with Sylvia (in her APARTMENT).

                    SYLVIA (O.S.)
          I’m gonna write you so many
          letters. So many letters the
          mailman says, that’s it, too many
          letters.

                    MARGARET
          Good. Great.

                    SYLVIA
          Have the best time, Sugar, we’ll
          see you when you get back.
                                                       117.


Sylvia looks over at Mr. Binamin sitting drinking coffee in
his pajamas. He MOVED IN with her.

                    MARGARET
          ‘kay, bye Grandma.

Margaret hangs up, goes into the LIVING ROOM, where Barb some
last items into her CAMP TRUNK, filled to the brim. (Behind
her, we see the living room now includes a DEDICATED CORNER
for her painting stuff).

                    BARBARA
          Alright, think that’s everything.
          Now let’s see if we can close it.

Barb swings the lid down. Margaret climbs on top of it, using
all her weight to push it. Barb secures the latches. They
high-five.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Almost like we’ve done this before.

Margaret hears the LAWN MOWER START UP, looks out the front
window. Barb’s figured out she likes Moose.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          We owe him for the month. You wanna
          give it to him?

Margaret turns to Barb, her face lit up, thankful for the
excuse.


EXT. SIMONS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Margaret finds Moose making laps with the mower, singing Erie
Canal to himself.

                    MARGARET
          Hey Moose...

Moose waves. She holds up the BILLS. He turns the mower off.
They walk towards each other.

                     MOOSE
              (taking the money)
          Thanks.

                    MARGARET
          Sure...

She just nods and smiles for a moment.
                                                       118.


                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          Well, have a good summer since I
          won’t see you for a while.

                    MOOSE
          Oh? When are you going?

                    MARGARET
          Camp. New Hamsphire. Leaving later
          today...

                    MOOSE
          Oh. Well. Have fun.

                    MARGARET
          Yeah.

                    MOOSE
          And... send me a post card maybe.

A dumb grin forms on Margaret’s face, not expecting that.

                    MARGARET
          Really? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I will.

Moose smiles, walks back over to this mower. Margaret turns
around and heads back towards the house, glowing.


INT. SIMONS’ LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Margaret climbs the stairs two-by-two, grinning to herself.
She skips down the hall, ducks into--


INT. MARGARET’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

She pulls down her shorts, sits down to pee, still smiling,
replaying what he said. She gets up front the toilet,
suddenly FREEZES, seeing something. Her eyes get as big as
dinner plates. For a second, she can’t breathe. Then--

                    MARGARET
          Mom! MOMMMMMMMMMMM!!!

BARB is DOWN THE HALL, putting some TOWELS into the LINEN
CLOSET. She startles, rushes down the hall, worried. Sticks
her head into the BATHROOM.

                    BARBARA
          What is it? What’s wrong?

Margaret looks up at her, can’t believe what she’s about to
say.
                                                       119.


                       MARGARET
          I got it.

Barbara doesn’t know what she means for a se.

                       BARBARA
          What?

                    MARGARET
          My period, I got my period!

As she says the words aloud, she starts to LAUGH AND CRY AT
THE SAME TIME, short-circuiting from all the emotions. This
is wonderful! This is awful! It’s such a relief! I’m so
scared! I’m finally growing up! Oh god I’m not a kid anymore.

                       BARBARA
          Oh my god.

Barb starts to choke up too, then LAUGHS, feeling silly about
all these emotions.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Here, wait a minute, I’ll get the
          pads, I got you some just in case,
          I was going to sneak ‘em in your
          camp trunk when you weren’t
          looking!

Margaret laughs. Barb hurries to get the BOX from a HALL
CABINET, comes back with the PAD for Margaret.

                    BARBARA (CONT'D)
          Here. Okay, so this is how you do
          it, you pull this thing off and
          there’s a sticky part that goes--

Margaret grabs the pad away.

                    MARGARET
          I already know! I’ve been
          practicing for two months!

They both start laughing again.

                    BARBARA
          Okay. I guess I’ll wait outside
          then.

Barb closes the door, steps into the HALLWAY to give Margaret
privacy.

INSIDE THE BATHROOM--
                                                       120.


Margaret peels the paper off the pad, presses it against her
underwear, pulls up her shorts. She can’t believe she’s doing
this for real.

She turns to look at herself in the mirror. Thrilled and a
little scared by the new person staring back at her.

She draws in a breath, letting it all settle in.

Then, a tiny little thought arrives.

It hovers there, crumb-sized.

Her eyes tick up to the ceiling.

THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.

We hang for a moment in the darkness.

Then:

                     MARGARET (V.O.)
           Are you still there God? It’s me,
           Margaret.

END CREDIT MUSIC BEGINS.



THE END.
