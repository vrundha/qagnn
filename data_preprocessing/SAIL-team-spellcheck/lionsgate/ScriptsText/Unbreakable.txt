OVER BLACK - A VOICE. 13 years old. Super enthusiastic.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Here’s a true fact. Things break.

CLOSE ON a beer bottle, SHATTERING ON THE FLOOR.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          See?

Leather shoes stumble, drunk, over the broken shards.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Sometimes it’s bad when they break,
          sometimes it’s good. You don’t
          always know which it’s gonna be.
          Dad says that’s a metaphor. Mom                       *
          says Dad doesn’t know what a                          *
          metaphor is.                                          *

And now we TILT UP to reveal --


INT. IOWA COUNTRY CLUB - INDOOR PATIO - NIGHT

SCOTT, 42. The drunk guy who broke the bottle. He eyes a
crowd of well-dressed country-clubbers. Staring back at him,
uncomfortable. A banner reads: HAPPY NEW YEAR!

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          In my life, lots of things have
          broken. Toys, dishes, shoelaces,
          bones. I’ll tell you about all of
          them, don’t worry. But I’m starting
          with this one, cause it’s important.

Scott pushes through guests to the bathroom, trying REAL HARD
to look sober. Guess what, he’s failing.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          See that guy? That’s my Dad. He’s
          the BEST.


INT. COUNTRY CLUB - MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Scott stands at the bathroom mirror, squaring off with
himself. His speech is slurred.

                    SCOTT
          You are lost, my friend. Your moral
          compass is broken. You’re failing
          as a husband and a father.
                                                            2.


He leans closer. There’s shame behind his eyes. It’s sad.
Then he darkens.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Yeah? Who are you to judge me?!

Before he can answer himself, the door opens and an ELDERLY
MAN steps in. Scott straightens.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Hey man, what’s up. Sweet tie.

The old man glances at his tie. Is it sweet? He closes the
stall to do his business and Scott turns back to himself.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Just cool it. You’re fine, you’re
          still in control. Now walk back out
          there, sober up and go home. Okay?
          Okay...

He fumbles with the keys, drops them in the sink. Dang it.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          I’ll drive.


INT. IOWA COUNTRY CLUB - INDOOR PATIO - NIGHT

Scott rejoins the party, searching the crowd. He catches a
glimpse of a COLORFUL JESTER’S HAT, floating between people.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Look at me, I am rocking that hat.
          I’m Austin. Richard Austin LeRette.
          But you can call me Auz. Or Auz Man.

We finally get a good look at AUSTIN. He’s 13, but seems
younger. His face glows with innocence and enthusiasm. He
wanders the party, snatching finger food off every passing
tray. His little brother LOGAN, 11 right beside him.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          When I meet new people, I tell them
          everything. Ready? I love sneakers,
          pancakes, Batman, SpongeBob, Back
          to The Future, chicken nuggets and
          ranch dressing. Ranch dressing is
          the bomb! I’m really good at video
          games, especially Call of Duty, and
          I have a killer DVD collection, and
          also a shoelace collection and a
          hat collection. Wearing just the
          right hat makes my day.
                                                         3.


We notice Austin walks with a bit of a limp.

                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
          I have a condition called
          Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Those are
          big words, but it basically means
          my bones break easy. I’ve broken my
          arms, my nose, my ribs, my head, my
          legs, my feet, pretty much
          everything. It kinda stinks, but
          you get used to it. I also have
          autism. Some autistic kids can’t
          talk, but I sure can! I have a pet
          lizard named Marty, and I love 80s
          rock music and I might have told
          you also ranch dressing. But hold
          on, I don’t want to lose my train
          of thought...
              (beat)
          “Thought.” Thought.... Thought....
          Thought, thought, thought, thought,
          thought, THOUGHT.
              (deep breath, then)
          THOUGHT! Okay.

Scott finds his boys in the crowd, grabs them by the hand --

                    SCOTT
          Come on, time to go home.

OUTSIDE, he leads them to the car. Austin mimics his dad’s
drunken walk, thinks it’s hilarious.

CLOSE ON AUSTIN. He fixates on his hat’s colorful pom poms,
bouncing with every step. Then Scott trips, falls to the
ground. He lays there in the gravel, LAUGHING kind of crazy.
Austin LAUGHS, too. But Logan is worried.

                    LOGAN
          Dad? Are you okay? Dad?!

A PASSING MAN helps Scott to his feet, hands him the keys.
Careful, there. Scott throws him a friendly salute, and
Austin smiles.

                    AUSTIN
          Happy New Year! Please, thank you,
          you’re welcome, I love you!

AT THE CAR, Scott loads the kids in the back and climbs
behind the wheel. Logan is scared, but poor little Austin has
no idea the danger he’s in.
                                                            4.


Scott FIRES UP THE ENGINE and peels out onto the winding
road, already swerving. As his car disappears into the night,
we hear the countdown to midnight - “5, 4, 3, 2...!!”

AND WE CUT TO BLACK.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          That was the night when everything
          broke.

Then:

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Oh wait, first I need to tell you
          about the green khaki pants! Without
          the green khaki pants I wouldn’t
          even be here.


    TITLE: 13 YEARS, 9 MONTHS AND 3 WEEKS EARLIER


INT. “STRUCTURE” CLOTHING STORE - DAY

A YOUNGER SCOTT (29) flips through a rack of pleated khakis.
But his eyes are on the sales girl.

Scott turns to his best friend JOE, 30. Big, bearded guy.
Think Seth Rogen or Zack Galifianakis.

                    SCOTT
          Do you see that girl’s eyes?
          Seriously, Joe, look, they’re the
          craziest blue I’ve ever seen.

                    JOE
          So talk to her. Buy something.

                       SCOTT
          Buy what?

                       JOE
          Buy pants.

Great idea. Scott waves to the girl. She walks over. This is
TERESA, 27. Mellow, cool, a little enigmatic. Her eyes really
are crystal blue. Even the whites seem blue. It’s incredible.

                    SCOTT
          Excuse me. Hi. I’m interested in
          these green pants.

                    TERESA
          Good choice.
                                                         5.


                    SCOTT
          Yeah. I’m Scott. I travel a lot for
          work, so...

Teresa realizes. Oh, he’s flirting. She sizes him up. He’s
kind of goofy, but also kind of sweet.

                    TERESA
          Yeah? What kind of work is that?

                    SCOTT
          Medical rep. For now. But I have
          bigger plans.

                    TERESA
          And are these plans pants related?

                    SCOTT
          Could be. The pants could be part
          of it. So you should definitely
          sell me some.

                    TERESA
          Anything I can do to help.

                    SCOTT
          And hey, you work on commission,
          right?

                    TERESA
          I do.

                    SCOTT
          Then I’ll buy four pair...
              (he grins)
          ...if you’ll have dinner with me.

                    TERESA
          Well, they’re already two for one,
          so...

                    SCOTT
          Okay. Then I’ll buy eight.

Teresa raises a playful eyebrow, contemplating.

                    TERESA
          Eight pair of green pants, really?
          How about this?...
              (scribbles her name and
               number on a receipt)
          You buy no pants, and I’ll have
          coffee with you.
                                                            6.


                    SCOTT
          Uhh... (reading her name) Teresa? I
          don’t think you get how negotiating
          works.

                    TERESA
          And you definitely don’t get how
          asking a girl out works. Here’s a tip,
          don’t use the word “negotiating”.

                    SCOTT
              (fumbling)
          Oh, I didn’t mean, this wasn’t
          like, I wasn’t offering you money
          to...

Joe shakes his head from where he’s eavesdropping. But Teresa
just laughs. All good. Scott quickly folds the receipt.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Ok, I’m just gonna take this and
          walk away before I talk you out of
          it.

                    TERESA
          Now who’s the bad negotiator?

He nods. Touche’.

                    SCOTT
          Okay, I’ll call you. And... I
          actually do really want the pants,
          but, yeah, I’ll come back another
          time for those.

As Scott walks out, Teresa grins. He’s cute. AUSTIN’S VO:

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          After that, Mom and Dad went on
          three dates in three weeks.


INT. SUPER FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A Maitre d’ seats Scott and Teresa at a candlelit table.

                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
          DATE #1.

Scott wears his green khakis and a tie. Teresa is under-
dressed. Jeans and a sweatshirt. She whispers, self conscious.

                    TERESA
          I said coffee, like a coffee shop.
                                                         7.


                    SCOTT
          Oh, don’t worry, they serve coffee
          here. I checked.

LATER, they talk over dinner, hitting it off. Scott lines up
the salt and pepper shakers perfectly with the votives. Teresa
notices, moves one an inch. He pretends it doesn’t bother him.
Then moves it back. She nods. Control freak. Noted.


INT. VIDEO ARCADE - NIGHT

                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
          DATE #2, video games. Mom
          dominated.

Scott and Teresa sit side by side, playing a shooting game.
Teresa kicks ass. Scott is frustrated.

                    SCOTT
          I was in the military, how are you
          a better shot than me??

She turns to him and fires her last two rounds without even
looking at the screen. Nails it.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Okay, let’s go find something I can
          win.

IN THE PHOTO BOOTH. They take a series of pics. The last one
Teresa rests her head on Scott’s shoulder. It’s sweet.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD SIDEWALK - NIGHT

A late night walk through suburban Iowa.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          DATE #3. Mostly talking...

Scott wears the khakis again. As he walks, he makes sure to
take exactly two steps in each sidewalk square. She notices.

                    TERESA
          So why leave the Navy?

                    SCOTT
          Did my time. It was a great
          experience, I was proud to serve.
          But -- I like change. Adventure.
          I want to go everywhere. Do
          everything.
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)          8.


                    TERESA
          So what’s the next adventure?

                    SCOTT
          Advertising. That’s my real dream.           *
          I’m quitting the day job and
          starting school in the fall.

                     TERESA
          Isn’t advertising just making                *
          people feel unsatisfied with what
          they have?

                    SCOTT
          What?? No, it’s helping people
          dream of something better. A good
          ad campaign is romantic, it’s
          emotional, it’s.... ART.

                    TERESA
          Art. Wow. Okay then, I’m sold.

                    SCOTT
          See? Did my job. Five years from
          now I’ll be in Manhattan, working            *
          for a big agency, driving a green
          Volvo.

                    TERESA
          Well, I admire your ambition. And
          your stylish yet responsible taste
          in cars.

Scott grins. He stops walking and turns to her.

                    SCOTT
          And I admire your incredible blue
          eyes. Been admiring them all night
          actually. Seriously, I’ve never
          seen anything like them.

Teresa glances away, a little self conscious.

                    TERESA
          Yeah. Funny thing about them. It’s
          actually a genetic defect. My
          collagen doesn’t work right, so the
          whites are really thin and the blue
          arteries show through.

                    SCOTT
          Well the defect is working for you.
                       Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                9.


She meets his gaze. A moment. There’s definitely chemistry
here. Scott steps closer. Are they gonna kiss?

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Okay, your turn. Five year plan.

                    TERESA
          Oh. I’m a one-day-at-a-time gal.

                    SCOTT
          But.... Married? Kids?                                *

                    TERESA
          We’ll see. I’m in no hurry.

Scott eyes her, there’s more there. But Teresa turns the
attention back on him.

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          Know what else I admire about you?
          Your pleated pants.

Scott LAUGHS. She likes that she makes him laugh.

                    SCOTT
          Right?? I tried buying them from
          this beautiful sales girl with the
          most amazing defective eyes, but
          she was too principled to take my
          money.

                    TERESA
          My kind of girl.

                       SCOTT
          Mine, too.

And now they kiss. It’s good. Really good.

                    TERESA
          Want to get out of here?

He does. They kiss more. But before it gets too heavy:

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          They never had a fourth date, cause
          then this happened...


INT. SCOTT’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Scott sprawls out on his lazy boy, drinking beer, watching
TV. Joe’s on the couch. The phone RINGS.                        *
                                                        10.


                    JOE
          Bet it’s your girlfriend.

                    SCOTT
          Girlfriend? Gimme a break, I don’t
          even know her last name.

Joe grabs the cordless, checks caller ID. Toldja. He tosses
Scott the phone. Scott answers, playful.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Well, hey there. If you’re calling
          to ask me out again, I’m gonna need
          to know your last name.

                    TERESA (O.S.)
          Scott? Hey, listen....

Her voice sounds off. Scott sits up in the chair.

                    SCOTT
          Everything alright?

                    TERESA
          Yeah. Well, no. Can you.... Can you
          come to the hospital and get a
          blood test?

                       SCOTT
          A what?

                    TERESA
          A blood test.

                    SCOTT
          Why would I.... (face falls) Is
          this an STD thing?

                       TERESA
          What?? No.

                    SCOTT
          Right, no, of course, thank God.
          Wait, did you commit a crime? Did I??

                    TERESA
          Scott. Just listen.

                    SCOTT
          Okay. Yeah. I’m listening.

He props himself on his elbow. Waits.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          You’re not saying anything.

                    TERESA
              (finally)
          I’m pregnant.

Scott jolts like he’s been tasered. He falls out of his
chair, hits his head on the desk. Spills beer everywhere.

                    SCOTT
          Hold on. Wait... dang it! Ow. Hold
          on.

                       TERESA
          It’s okay.

                    SCOTT
          Give me a second. I’m just, I’m
          thinking...

                    TERESA
          You fell, I heard you. It’s okay.

                    SCOTT
          You’re saying this is... mine??
          This is ME you’re pregnant with? I
          mean, FROM.

                    TERESA
          Scott. I don’t need anything from
          you.

                    SCOTT
          Except my blood.

                       TERESA
          Forget it.

                    SCOTT
          No. Wait. I’m sorry. Wait....
              (takes a breath)
          Pregnant.

It really hits. He lowers the phone. To himself:

                       SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Crap.

EXT. SCOTT’S APARTMENT - BACKYARD - NIGHT

Scott and Joe sit on patio chairs by a pit fire. Joe drinks
Bud Light from a bottle. Scott taps his feet. Three on the
left, three on the right. They both wear green khakis.           *

                    JOE
          You like her though, right?

                    SCOTT
          I mean... Yeah. She’s attractive,
          obviously, and smart - not just
          smart, clever. She seems a little
          insecure, maybe, I’m not sure. But
          it’s actually kind of nice.
          She’s.... real.

                    JOE
          Real is good. And you want kids.

                    SCOTT
          Some day. After I’ve done a million
          other things. I was about to quit
          my job, get my degree. This is the
          worst possible time. And a baby, I
          mean... that’s FOREVER.

                    JOE
          Yeah, they do tend to last.

Scott rubs his temples. Joe can’t think of what to say, so --

                    JOE (CONT'D)
          Beer?

Scott shakes his head. Joe shrugs, grabs himself a fresh one
and pops the cap. It overflows - spraying all over his shirt.

                    JOE (CONT'D)
          Aw, dang it!

As Joe recoils from the spill, Austin’s VO interrupts.

                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you the
          thing about Joe. It’s pretty
          important.
              (beat)
          He’s not real. He’s made up. He’s
          my dad’s imaginary friend.

BACK TO SCENE. Now it’s Scott who recoils from the beer.
                                                          13.


                    SCOTT
          Aw, dang it!

CUT WIDE to reveal it’s true, THERE IS NO JOE. Just Scott
sitting alone, talking to himself, beer all over his shirt.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Dad invented him as a kid. It’s how
          he talks through things. Like Tyler
          Durden in Fight Club. I flippin’
          love that movie!

And now Scott sits alone by the fire. Talks to himself.

                    SCOTT
          This is bad, Joe. This is really,
          really bad.

We pan over, and Joe is back. And he has a thought.

                    JOE
          Hey. You know what else was bad?
          When you broke your collarbone
          freshman year.

Scott looks at him. Perking up. He nods, you’re right.


INT. “STRUCTURE” CLOTHING STORE - DAY

Teresa at work. Scott follows her as she folds and
straightens clothes. He’s trying to make a point.

                    SCOTT
          I was playing football. It hurt
          like hell, and I was laid out for
          months, and that’s the only reason
          I took up guitar.

                     TERESA
          So what, you play in a band or
          something?

                    SCOTT
          No, how cool would that be? But I
          love playing, and I’m good at it.
          Point is, sometimes good things
          come from bad things. Okay, forget
          the guitar. How about.... cheese.
          You love cheese.

                    TERESA
          Everyone loves cheese.
                                                  14.


                    SCOTT
          Well, cheese is just milk that’s
          gone bad, right? Like raisins are
          just bad grapes.

                    TERESA
          Raisins are the worst, I hate
          raisins.

                    SCOTT
          Fine. Who’s that scientist that
          accidentally discovered ibuprofen.
          Figment....or Fletcher --

                     TERESA
          Fleming.

                     SCOTT
          Exactly.

                    TERESA
          It was penicillin.

                    SCOTT
          Exactly! Yes! A mistake in the lab
          and it leads to one of the greatest
          breakthroughs in medical history.
          Good from bad, right?
              (point made)
          Maybe that’s what this is.

Teresa stops folding. Sighs.

                    TERESA
          We don’t even know each other, Scott.

                    SCOTT
          That’s the bad part. The good part
          is -- a new person. A person we
          made! You and me.

                    TERESA
          I get what you’re doing, and it’s
          nice. But I don’t need you sticking
          around out of obligation.

                    SCOTT
          Why not? I do have an obligation.
          And I want to be a father. A GREAT
          father. Like my father. I want to
          be the cool Dad, the Dad who gets
          it. Who has all the answers, who
          knows how to show affection. Who’s
          there.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          And no, I didn’t think it would
          happen this soon, or like this. But
          it’s happening. That --
              (points to her belly)
          -- makes me a father. And my kid is
          NOT gonna grow up without a father.
          I’m gonna be there. And I’m gonna
          be SO cool.

Teresa smiles, she can’t help it.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Look at your face, I’m winning you
          over! All I’m saying -- what I’m
          proposing -- is let’s give this a
          try. Together. Could be good. Right?

He’s totally sincere, and kind of adorable, and from the look
on her face, this is actually what she was hoping he’d say.


EXT. SCOTT’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - DAY

Scott parks his ‘92 Buick Century before a white two story
house, framed by Iowa cornfields. Joe in the passenger seat.

                    JOE
          Oh man, your Mom is gonna destroy
          you!

                    SCOTT
          Yeah, well if I go, you go with me.

And then - CRASH!!


INT. SCOTT’S PARENTS' HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

SCOTT’S MOM (50s) SMASHES a dish on the kitchen floor.

                    SCOTT’S MOM
          What’s the matter with you?? Are you
          STUPID?! You should be married by
          now, not getting some girl pregnant!
          This is not how I raised you!

Mom is short and tough. Her home is adorned with strong
Catholic influences, which only reinforces the problem.

Scott sits at the kitchen table, sheepish, across from his
DAD, a quiet, kind, blue collar man.

They avoid eye contact as Mom storms out of the room, BREAKS
something else. Dad shrugs.

                    SCOTT’S DAD
          Give her a minute. You know the
          Warden, she processes through
          destruction.
              (leans closer)
          But hey. I’m proud of you.

                     SCOTT
          You are?

                    SCOTT’S DAD
          You’re stepping up. Facing
          consequences. That’s what a man
          does. What a Dad does.

Scott nods. Okay.

                    SCOTT
          But I don’t know if I’m ready to be
          a Dad.

                    SCOTT’S DAD
          Oh, I’m not either. Parents have no
          idea what’s going on. None of us.

                    SCOTT
          Thanks. Gotta say, I did not think                     *
          this would go so well.

Another CRASH.


EXT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S APARTMENT - DAY

A charming little apartment complex in small town Iowa. MOVING
TRUCK parked outside. Scott and Teresa (now 4 months pregnant)
climb out. Stand and look at the apartment together.

                    TERESA
          So we’re doing this?

                    SCOTT
          I think we’re doing this.

LATER, Teresa sorts boxes. Scott and Joe wrestle a mattress
through the front entrance.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Lower the left side, lower the left
          side. The LEFT SIDE!

Teresa watches him, amused, as he hefts the mattress alone,
yelling at himself. What a weirdo.

INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The place is half-unpacked. Some boxes against the walls.
Fast food wrappers on the coffee table.

Teresa sits on Scott’s lazy boy, playing PLAYSTATION 2. Scott    *
strums his guitar on the couch. He looks around.

                    SCOTT
          It’s not bad, right? Small.

                    TERESA
          Not too small. I like it.

                    SCOTT
          We’ll get a house soon.
              (plays a riff)
          Once my band goes platinum.

                    TERESA
          It’s the album that goes platinum,
          dummy, not the band.

                    SCOTT
          You want the house or not?

                    TERESA
          Hey, what happened to your                             *
          advertising degree? Weren’t you                        *
          supposed to start in the fall?

                    SCOTT
          Yeah. Something came up.
              (pokes her belly)
          I knocked up this girl and have to
          help raise the baby for a while.
          Just long enough to look like a
          good guy. Then, back to my dreams!

She laughs, but seems sad to hear that. She pauses the game --

                    TERESA
          So, hey.... there’s something I
          haven’t told you yet.

                    SCOTT
          Scary way to start our first night
          together.

Teresa gets up, busies herself clearing the dinner wrappers.

                    TERESA
          It’s just. One of the side effects
          of my “amazing” blue eyes....

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
              (deep breath)
          I have a condition called
          Osteogenesis Imperfecta. “O.I.”

Scott follows her into the kitchen. Concerned.

                    SCOTT
          Which means?

                    TERESA
          It means my bones are very brittle.
          They break easily.

Scott doesn’t respond. But she can see it right away. He
thinks I’m defective. Teresa tucks her thumbs under her          *
fingers, making a fist, then squeezes. A nervous habit.          *

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          I would have told you sooner, but
          it’s not exactly the kind of thing
          you share on a first date. Or a
          third. And then...

She looks to her belly. Scott can see she feels vulnerable.

                    SCOTT
          Well, you seem fine to me.

She wishes he used a better word than “fine”.

                    TERESA
          I am. I’m fine. Broke a lot of bones
          growing up, but I’ve learned how to
          live with it. There’s just certain
          things I can’t do. Sports, skydiving...

                    SCOTT
              (shrugs)
          Ok. No skydiving. I can live with
          that.

                    TERESA
          Anyway, I thought you should know,
          because.... it’s genetic, so...

Scott moves to her.

                    SCOTT
          T. Our baby is gonna be perfect.
          And if we’re lucky -- his eyes will
          be half as defective as yours.

She laughs, grateful. Scott wraps his arms around her. But as
we PUSH IN, we see his gaze go far off. FROM THIS --

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Teresa SCREAMS, mid-delivery. Scott by her side. Joe is there
for moral support.

                    SCOTT
          You’re doing great, T. You’re a
          champ.

                    TERESA
          You don’t know that, you don’t even
          KNOW me!!

A NURSE frowns at Scott. He waves it off.

                    SCOTT
          Not true, I know her, it’s just new.

Then T’s sister LORI (34) runs in, disheveled even in scrubs.   *

                    LORI                                        *
          I’m here, I’m here! Stupid boss                       *
          made me settler the register and my                   *
          dang truck wouldn’t start again.                      *

She rushes to Teresa’s other side. Takes her hand.              *

                    TERESA                                      *
          Finally! Scott, this is my sister                     *
          Lori. Lori, Scott.... AAAWWHHHHH!!!                   *

Scott and Lori shake awkwardly over Teresa’s belly. The nurse   *
eyes Scott again.                                               *

                    DOCTOR
          Okay, here’s the head...

Scott peeks, curious, then goes pale. Turns to Joe.

                    SCOTT
          Don’t look. There’s blood.

Joe looks, and instantly faints. Hits the floor with a THUD.

                    DOCTOR
              (calling out)
          Cord is wrapped around the neck.
          Get me forceps.

Everyone SCRAMBLES. The nurse hands him the cold metal
instrument. Scott gapes.

          I’m feeling light headed, can I get
          some ice chips?

                    NURSE
          Ice is for the mother.

          Right. You, too. Breathe. We’ll
          both breathe.

And as she SCREAMS again, Austin’s VO comes back --

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Okay, pay attention. Here’s the
          part where I come in.

TERESA’S SCREAM echos over to:

BABY AUSTIN. Swaddled in Scott’s arms. Eyes blue as the
ocean. Just like his mother’s.

PUSH IN ON SCOTT. Filled with wonder. He stares into the face
of his son, utterly in love. His world changed.

Lori strokes Teresa’s head, whispers to her. The two of them    *
seem close, as if they’ve endured hard times together.          *

Scott’s Mom and Dad dote over the baby.

                    SCOTT
          Mom, Dad. Meet Richard Austin
          LeRette.

                     SCOTT’S MOM
          He’s a miracle.
              (beat)
          Despite your bad choices.
                                                          21.


FROM THE BED, Teresa watches Scott. Tears running down his
face. She smiles. Scott carries Austin to her.

                    SCOTT
          Check it out, T. We made a boy.
          Look at him, he’s perfect.

She gazes at her son. He is perfect. Then he starts CRYING.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          I cried a lot. Right away. Partly
          cause I was a baby. And partly
          cause those metal things broke my
          ribs. But no one even knew.

Close on BABY AUSTIN’S SCREAMING FACE.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          That was break #1.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

ANGLE ON Scott and Teresa, utterly exhausted, staring down
into Austin’s crib. He’s still SCREAMING.

                    SCOTT
          When does he sleep? When do WE
          sleep?

                    TERESA
              (shell shocked)
          What have we done?

Scott turns to Joe for help. He’s just as exhausted.

                    JOE
          Looks like you got this, I’m going
          to bed.

And he bails.


QUICK MONTAGE - AS BABY AUSTIN GROWS

- SCOTT SLEEPS. Teresa feeds Austin. He pukes, then CRIES.

- TERESA SLEEPS. Scott feeds Austin. He pukes, then CRIES.

- THEY BOTH SLEEP. From the crib, we hear Austin puke. Then
CRY. Teresa shakes Scott.
                       Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)               22.


                    TERESA
          I’ll pay you ten thousand dollars
          to clean that up.

- IN THE DEN, Teresa plays VAMPIRE NIGHT on PS2, Austin         *
napping on her belly. She sings ‘You Are My Sunshine’ softly
as she plays. Scott smiles.

                    SCOTT
          You know what I admire about you?
          You can soothe a baby and kill
          vampires at the same time.                            *

- ON THE COUCH, Scott watches TV, spent. Baby bottle in one
hand, beer bottle in the other. Almost feeds Austin the beer.

- IN THE BEDROOM, Scott stares into his son’s eyes. Despite
everything, so in love. Austin starts CRYING. Scott SIGHS.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Come on, little dude. What are you                    *
          trying to tell me here? What am I
          doing wrong?

But the SCREAMING gets louder. It’s unbearable. Scott covers
his ears with two throw pillows. Trying not to lose his mind.

AT THE FRONT DOOR - Teresa holds a crying SIX MONTH OLD
AUSTIN. Scott kisses his head, suitcase in hand.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Daddy’s gotta work. Back in a few                     *
          days.

Teresa is not stoked. Scott closes the door behind him.
Austin still CRYING inside. Scott take a breathe. Relief.

THE SEQUENCE ENDS WITH -- AUSTIN (now 14 months) IN THE FRONT
YARD. Taking his first steps. Scott and Teresa CHEER HIM ON.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Scott sits at his desk, busy on his laptop. Austin toddles
around, carrying a Curious George book, making monkey noises.

                    TERESA
          Headed to the store. You got him?

                       SCOTT
          I got him.
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                23.


                    TERESA
          I shut the garage door and the
          bathroom but he’s moving fast today.                 *

                    SCOTT
          T. I got him. The gate is up. We’re
          good.

She leaves and Scott gets back to work. Behind him, Austin
grabs the arm of the rolling chair, pulls himself up.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Hey, no climbing on the chair,
          little monkey. No!

Scott pushes back and Austin loses his grip, falling
backwards hard. Scott hears an awful SNAP. He looks down to
find Austin on the floor. His leg bent at a 90 degree angle.

Austin WAILS. Scott’s face goes white.


INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - DAY

Scott rushes into the hospital, carrying Austin. The Curious
George book duct taped around his leg as a makeshift splint.


INT. HOSPITAL BAY - DAY

Scott holds Austin’s hand as they wrap his leg in a cast.
Teresa runs in, goes right to Austin. She glares at Scott.

                    TERESA
          What did you do??

                    SCOTT
          Nothing, he tripped. Barely. Fell
          against my chair, I don’t get it.

Which gives Teresa a sick feeling in her stomach.

LATER, they sit with the DOCTOR, Austin has a cast on his
leg. He plays with toys, happy as can be.

                    DOCTOR
          His leg will heal fine. But I took a
          body scan and noticed two of his ribs
          had been broken and healed over.

                    SCOTT
          What?? How?
                                                          24.


                    DOCTOR
          Most likely from childbirth.

                    TERESA
              (horrified)
          That’s why he cried so much! Oh my
          God, Scott....

Her eyes fill with tears, heart breaking to think of it. Then
the doctor looks to Teresa, hesitates.

                    DOCTOR
          Also... we ran the tests. And you’re
          right, he does have OI. I’m sorry.

Teresa’s face falls, worst fears confirmed. She turns on Scott.

                    TERESA
          Why did you let him fall?!

                    SCOTT
          I’m sorry, T. I’m really sorry.

She collapses into him. As Scott comforts her, Austin stares
at the Curious George book on the floor, in his own world.

We end on Teresa, looking at AUSTIN’S LITTLE CAST.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          That was break #2.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The furniture is now wrapped with padding. Austin zips
through the apartment, cast free, Teresa chasing after.

                    TERESA
          Austin, no running!

LATER. More running. More chasing. Austin GIGGLES. This kid
loves to run.

                       TERESA (CONT'D)
          Watch him!

                    SCOTT
          I’ve got him.

Austin trips. SCREAMS.

                       SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Dammit!
                                                          25.


INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Arm in a sling, Austin plays with the nurses, making them
laugh. Teresa glares at Scott again.

                      AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Break #3.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Scott and Teresa commiserate as they get ready for bed.

                    TERESA
          ....At lunch he pulled all the
          napkins from the dispenser, one by
          one. I told him to stop, but he
          wouldn’t, what am I gonna do? Can’t
          spank him, he might break.

                    SCOTT
          The kid’s got all the power.

                    TERESA
          It’s impossible, Scott, I’m
          panicked all the time.

                    SCOTT
          I know, me too! We’re being held
          hostage by a toddler!


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - SCOTT’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Scott digs though boxes. Tax stuff. Joe pours them both wine.
Scott gulps his down. Stares at some paperwork, confused.

                    SCOTT
          This is weird.

                    JOE
          What’s weird?

                    SCOTT
          Teresa’s last name is Houser.

                    JOE
          That’s not that weird.

Scott holds up a legal document.

                     SCOTT
          So why does this say Teresa
          Morrison??
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                26.


CLOSE ON PAPER. The words ‘Teresa Morrison’. Further down,
the word ‘DIVORCE’. Scott and Joe look at each other. WTF?

                    TERESA (PRELAP)
          Yes. I was married...


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - DEN - NIGHT

Scott paces, a little drunk. Teresa looks ashamed. Tucking    *
her thumbs under her fingers again.                           *

                    TERESA
          Twice.

                    SCOTT
          Twice??

                    TERESA
          Yes. Jim for a few months, then
          Rudy for a few years.

Scott tries to process this.                                  *

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          I was 18 the first time. Just                       *
          needed to get out of my house.                      *
              (with difficulty)                               *
          My father was an alcoholic and my                   *
          mom, she tried, really tried, to                    *
          hold everything together. They’re                   *
          not bad people, they just... it was                 *
          a mess.... and I thought getting                    *
          married was my way out. When that                   *
          didn’t work, I tried again.                         *

                    SCOTT
          Anything else you want to share
          while we’re getting to know each
          other?

                    TERESA
          No. That’s it.

Scott paces more. Teresa goes quiet. Bracing for the worst.

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          Are you mad?

                     SCOTT
          Yeah, I’m mad!
              (beat)
          I guess. I don’t know. I feel a
          little duped, Teresa.
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                27.


                    TERESA
          I wasn’t trying to hide anything, I
          just... I was afraid you’d be done
          with me. I wouldn’t blame you...

Her eyes fill with tears, turning the whites even more blue.

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          I have two failed marriages, bones
          made of chalk. I’m damaged goods.
          My father used to call me “an
          accident waiting to happen.”

Just saying those words seems to send her back. She turns
away from Scott, closing off.

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          I would dream I was in a fairy tale,
          but I never knew if I was the
          princess or the ugly stepsister.
              (more tears)
          I always felt cursed. And now our                    *
          son is cursed...

She wipes her face, trying to be strong. But she looks
ashamed, broken. It breaks Scott’s heart. He goes to her.

                    SCOTT
          Hey. Our son is not cursed. You are
          not cursed.
              (takes her hand)
          There’s a lot we don’t know about
          each other. I’m not perfect either.
          For instance, I use humor to
          deflect, it’s not healthy.

                    TERESA
          True. And you’re not even that
          funny.

                    SCOTT
          Let’s just.... from now on no more
          secrets, okay?

                    TERESA
          Deal.


EXT. BIKE PATH - MORNING

Scott rides a trail on his mountain bike. Joe pedals beside
him. His bike is identical to Scott’s. After a beat --
                                                          28.


                       JOE
          Twice.

                       SCOTT
          It’s fine.

                    JOE
          Married two times. That’s a lot.

                       SCOTT
          It’s fine.

Scott pedals off, leaving Joe behind. Okay.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Scott and Teresa lie on the bed. Austin between them. He
starts fussing. Scott SHUSHES. Puts a pacifier in his mouth.

WE SEE AUSTIN’S POV of Scott, wide angle. His SHUSHING is
more like a BUZZING. Loud, assaulting. Austin spits out the
pacifier, cries louder. So Scott SHUSHES louder.

Then Teresa rests a hand on Austin’s belly. Gently sings.

                    TERESA
          You are my sunshine, my only
          sunshine. You make me happy when
          skies are grey...

Austin immediately calms, stops crying. His eyes close.

WE PUSH IN ON SCOTT, as he watches Teresa. Her voice calms
him, too. He smiles. A nostalgic smile, like he just imagined
a whole life with this woman, and it’s a good life.

Teresa gets up from the bed, gently places sleeping Austin in
the crib, then gathers some clothes, a dirty diaper, and
carries them from the room. Scott follows.


INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Teresa adds the dirty diaper to the pale, then pulls out the
gross full bag. Finally Scott says what’s on his mind.

                   SCOTT
          Hey.... I think we should get
          married.

Teresa stops. She shakes her head.
                                                           29.


                    TERESA
          No. Not right now.

                      SCOTT
          Why not?

                    TERESA
          It’s too soon.

                    SCOTT
          But. I think... I might love you.

Teresa practically rolls her eyes.

                     TERESA
          You’re telling me you might love
          me, as you propose. Right now?
              (lifts the used diaper bag)
          Like this?

                     SCOTT
          Come on, T, I’m being honest. This
          is where we are. What do you want
          me to say?

                      TERESA
          Not that.

She carries the diaper bag out to the hallway. He follows.


INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Teresa jams the bag into the trash chute. It gets stuck.

                    SCOTT
          Well... do you love ME?

                      TERESA
          No.

                    SCOTT
          Come on, don’t do that. We agreed,
          we should get married.

                    TERESA
          Don’t want to.

She jams the bag harder. Scott steps in, pushing until it
falls to the dumpster below.

                    SCOTT
          You don’t want to marry me?
                       Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                30.


                    TERESA
          Not now I don’t.

She struts back into the apartment. Scott looks to Joe.

                    JOE
          To be fair, it wasn’t the MOST
          romantic proposal.
              (pointing)
          There’s poop on your arm.

Scott looks. Dang it.

                    JOE (CONT'D)
          Don’t sweat it. She’ll come around.

AND WE CUT TO --

SCOTT, in his best suit. Teresa in a wedding dress. We circle
around them to reveal --


INT. CITY HALL - DAY

A LARGE TATTOOED WOMAN stands beside her SCARED HUSBAND.
We’re in CITY HALL. Before a JUSTICE OF THE PEACE.

                    JUSTICE
          Lay your hands on him again, ma’am,
          I’m locking you up. Understood?
              (to the husband)
          Restraining order granted.

Scott and Teresa share a look, try not to laugh. He whispers.

                    SCOTT
          Is this everything you dreamed?

The scared husband eyes Scott as he walks out. Good luck.

The JUSTICE looks to Scott and Teresa, to their family and
friends in the plastic chairs behind them, all dressed nice.

                    JUSTICE
          How about we do this outside?


EXT. CITY HALL GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER

A secret garden behind City Hall. Surprisingly beautiful.
SCOTT’S PARENTS hold Austin. Teresa’s sister Lori beside         *
them, along with a few other friends. And Joe, of course.

Scott faces Teresa, takes her hands in his. For the vows.
                                                        31.


                      SCOTT
            You know what I admire about you?

She smiles.

                      SCOTT (CONT'D)
            You make me feel calm. Even when I
            know you’re scared or overwhelmed,
            somehow you’re the one who comforts
            me. You think you’re weak, but
            you’re actually so strong. Austin is
            lucky to have you for his mom. And
            I’m lucky to have you for my wife.

Teresa’s eyes glisten. She takes a breath.

                      TERESA
            Know what I admire about you?
            You’re not afraid to say sappy
            sentimental stuff like that.
                (everyone laughs)
            No, I mean it. I’ve never had that
            with a man. With anyone. It’s nice.
            Oh, and by the way. I lied before.
            I think I might love you, too.

                         SCOTT
            I knew it.

                      JUSTICE
            Alright then. Husband and wife. Go
            ahead and kiss your bride.

Scott and Teresa kiss. Friends and family CHEER.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Teresa is asleep in bed. Scott sits in the dark, Austin
resting in his arms. Scott looks to Joe, end of a long day.

                      SCOTT
            I’m a husband. A dad and a husband.

Joe nods.

                       JOE
            Yeah. Heavy.
                (beat)
            Want a beer? I’ll get you a beer.

From this: TERESA’S PREGNANT BELLY.

EXT. SCOTT AND TERESA HOUSE - DAY

She stands before a large two story house with a big yard. In
the driveway, a shiny red Mustang and a white Ford Taurus.

Lori helps unload boxes. She eyes the house and cars.            *

                    LORI                                         *
          T, look at all this. How much does                     *
          he make selling medical supplies?                      *

                    TERESA                                       *
          Enough.                                                *

                    LORI                                         *
          I mean it, can you pull this off?                      *

                    TERESA                                       *
          Relax, Lori, I’m fine. He got                          *
          another promotion, he’s a good                         *
          salesman. It’s not exactly his                         *
          dream job, but... it gets us this.                     *

                    LORI                                         *
          Well dang, can I be a medical rep?                     *
          Never gonna get me a house like                        *
          this with Cracker Barrel money.                        *

Once again, Scott and Joe wrestle with a mattress, while         *
Austin runs around, excited. A cast on his right wrist.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Blue cast. Break #12.

Teresa looks to Austin.

                    TERESA
          What do you think, Auz Man? Like
          the new digs?

                    AUSTIN
          What’s “digs”?

                    TERESA
          The house. You like it?

                    AUSTIN
          Yes! I love digs!


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S HOUSE - MORNING

Austin chases Scott through the house (now fully furnished
and moved in) as Scott throws toys and snacks in a bag.
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                33.


                    SCOTT
          Come on, your baby brother is here!
          Wait till you see him, he’s like a
          little pink tomato!

Excited, Austin turns a corner and runs face first into a
dresser. He WAILS.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          No, no, no! Dude, is it your nose,                   *
          please tell me it’s not broken....
              (he looks. It is)
          Dang it.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Teresa holds her new baby in her arms. Glowing. Until Scott
slinks in with Austin. Black eye. Tape across the nose.

                    SCOTT
          He ran into the dresser. I tried
          to... I didn’t... I. I’m sorry.

A CONCERNED NURSE eyes Austin, whispers to another nurse.
Something about “...third time this year...” The two women
look to Teresa. But she waves them off, used to this.

                    TERESA
          Don’t worry, he’s not abusive. Our
          son has a brittle bone disease,
          you’ll see it in his charts.
              (nods at Scott)
          Trust me, if anyone’s getting hit
          tonight it’s him.

                    SCOTT
          Hey!

LATER, Austin eyes little LOGAN, swaddled in a blanket in
Teresa’s arms.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Auz Man, what do you think of your
          baby brother?

Austin stares at Logan for a long beat, really studying him.

                    AUSTIN
          Four red. Five blue.

Scott frowns. What? Then Teresa realizes.
                                                         34.


                    TERESA
          Stripes. The blanket.

It’s true. The hospital blanket has stripes. Four red, five
blue. Scott and Teresa exchange a look. Huh.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

First night home. Logan sleeps peacefully in his crib.

Scott and Teresa stare down at him, amazed. They give each
other a silent high five.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Logan was lucky. His bones didn’t
          break and he didn’t cry and he
          didn’t have autism or anything.


INT. LOGAN’S ROOM - MORNING

ONE-YEAR-OLD LOGAN climbs from his crib. Runs to Austin (now
3) and they play together. Logan seems like a normal kid.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          That’s when Mom and Dad started to
          realize I was different.


INT. AUSTIN’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Austin’s walls are lined with DVD and hat collections, all
color-coded. IN EXTREME CLOSE UP, we see him organize action
figures in perfect rows. Counting as he goes. In the zone.

                    AUSTIN
          Twenty-five, twenty-six... twenty-
          seven...

Then Scott pops in, interrupting.

                    SCOTT
          Come on, Auz-Man, shoes on, I’m
          late for work.

Austin pauses, then sweeps all the toys onto the floor and
starts lining them up again.

                    AUSTIN
          One... two... three... four...

                    SCOTT
          Austin, now! We need to go.
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                   35.


Austin takes a breath. Sweeps them off again.

                    AUSTIN
              (louder, upset)
          ONE! TWO! THREE!...

                    SCOTT
          Austin!! What is wrong with you?

Austin pauses again. Doesn’t look up. Just STARES AT THE
TOYS. Teresa step in, intervening.

                    TERESA
          Just let him finish, Scott.

Scott takes a breath. Looks at the large pile of toys, looks
at his watch. Sits down, frustrated. As Austin continues.

                    AUSTIN
          Four... Five... Six...

IN MACRO-FOCUS, we watch as Austin lifts a little airplane,
as it moves through space, landing perfectly on the shelf. An
inch to the right or left would be wrong. Scott SIGHS.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Sometimes I feel like my Dad is close
          and far away at the same time...


EXT. LAKE - DAY

Scott and Austin lie on a blanket by the lake, looking up at
the giant IOWA SKY. They eat Cheetos and point out clouds.

                    AUSTIN
          I like this day, Daddy.

                    SCOTT
          I like it too, little dude.                            *

LATER, they run together, flying a paper kite.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Like even though I’m right there,
          he doesn’t really see me.

                    AUSTIN
          It’s a dragon, Daddy. It’s a dragon!

                    SCOTT
          Yeah. I see it.
                                                           36.


AUSTIN’S POV, the kite comes to life as a CARTOON DRAGON. He
swoops down, breathing paper fire. As he flies by, HE SCOFFS -

                    CARTOON DRAGON
          He’s lying. He doesn’t see me.

Auz stops running, getting upset. Scott has no idea why.

                    AUSTIN
          You don’t really see him, you’re
          just saying that. Why can’t you see
          it?? Daddy, WHY??

Scott tries comforting him, but Austin is inconsolable.

                    SCOTT
          Austin, hey, relax, I don’t know
          what you want me to say, I don’t
          see what you see, I’m sorry.

Austin pushes him away. The moment is ruined. Behind them,
the kite falls to the ground. OVER THIS:

                    SCOTT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I’m worried about him.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Scott and Teresa get ready for bed.

                    SCOTT
          He won’t stop counting. He talks
          constantly....

Teresa eyes him tapping his feet.

                    TERESA
          Can’t imagine where he gets it
          from.

                    SCOTT
          That’s different.

                    TERESA
          You talk to yourself every day,
          Scott. Or to “Joe” anyway.

Joe jumps in.

                    JOE
          Hey, why the “air quotes”? Was that
          a dig, that felt like a dig!
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                37.


Scott turns on Teresa.

                    SCOTT
          Yeah, well our son certainly
          inherited more than enough from
          you.

                    TERESA
              (stung)
          Yes. Thanks for that. It’s what
          makes him our son. Stop treating
          him like he’s broken.

Scott feels bad. He softens.

                    SCOTT
          I don’t mean to. This just... isn’t
          what I thought it would be like.
          I feel like I’m failing. Every day.
          And the harder I try, the worse I                     *
          do. I just... can’t figure him out.

                    TERESA
          Maybe you’re not supposed to.

                    SCOTT
          Come on, T. Something isn’t right.
          Tell me you’re not worried.

She doesn’t have an answer. From this --


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S HOME - DEN - NIGHT

A ZOMBIE’S HEAD EXPLODES. Teresa and Scott play PS2. Blasting   *
an undead army. Teresa dominates, as always.

ON THE FLOOR, Austin and Logan watch the Jim Carrey movie The
Mask on a DVD player. Austin rubs his eyebrow as he watches.

ON SCREEN, Jim Carrey says: “It’s party time! P-A-R-T-Y.”
Austin repeats it.

                    AUSTIN
          It’s PARTY time! (then...)
          It’s PARTY time!.... It’s PARTY
          time!... It’s PARTY time!!

                    SCOTT
          Okay Auz, that’s enough.

                    AUSTIN
          It’s PARTY TIME! Party time, party
          time PARTY TIME!!!
                                                           38.


                    SCOTT
          AUZ!

Austin rubs his face more. Right palm over left eyebrow. It
hurts but he can’t stop. Over and over, more and more manic.

                    AUSTIN
          Party time, party time, party time,
          party time, PARTY TIME!!

He claws at his face. Scott and Teresa run to him.

                    SCOTT
          Hey, hey, hey. What’s going on? Can
          I help you, Auz? What can I do?

                    AUSTIN
              (crying)
          Make it stop! Daddy, make it
          stop!!! I want it out of my head!
              (hitting himself)
          PARTY, PARTY, PARTY, PARTY.....!!

Scott tries holding Austin but he slaps him away.

                    AUSTIN (CONT'D)
          ...PARTY, PARTY, PAAAAAAAAAARTY!!

They watch, helpless. Finally Austin stops, face red and
bleeding. He lets out a breath, his whole body relaxes.

Dad hugs him carefully. Looks to Teresa.


INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

Scott and Teresa watch through a window, worried, as a doctor
administers tests on Austin. Various puzzles and patterns.

Austin is laser focused. Moving pieces around, pointing at
objects, etc. OFF THIS:

                    SCOTT
          Autistic? But... How is that
          possible? We would have known.

He turns to a DOCTOR watching beside them.

                    DOCTOR
          There are all kinds of autism. It’s
          a spectrum. Some are more verbal
          than others, some don’t show the
          signs as early.
                                                        39.


                    SCOTT
          So what do we do? Does he grow out of
          it, is there medication?

                    DOCTOR
              (checking the chart)
          It looks like he’s already on SSRIs
          for OCD... various other things. We
          can experiment with additional
          medication now that we know more,
          but... No, don’t expect him to “grow
          out of it”, Mr. LeRette. This is who
          Austin is. The more you learn about
          it and embrace it, the better.

ON SCOTT AND TERESA, as they take this in.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Teresa sits at the table, head in her hands. Scott paces.

                    TERESA
          Is this punishment? For the way we
          had Austin?

                    SCOTT
          If you’re talking about God, I
          wouldn’t know how to answer that. But
          I’m sure lots of people have done
          worse things than what we did, and
          most of them didn’t end up with an
          autistic kid. So no. I think it’s
          just life. It’s just how it is.

He gets up.

                    TERESA
          Where are you going?

                    SCOTT
          I need some air.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

Scott and Joe sit side by side. Drinking whiskey. Scott is
good and drunk. He mumbles, dark...

                    SCOTT
          All those times... I’d yell at him,
          get so frustrated... make him feel
          stupid.... for just being who he is.
                                                         40.


He’s crushed by that thought. Joe pats him on the shoulder.

                    JOE
          You didn’t know. Now you do.
          He has autism. You have an autistic
          kid. That’s what it is. Better
          accept it, cause it’s real.

Scott nods, lets out a long, bitter breath. Downs his whiskey.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Teresa is getting everyone out the door. Scott is hung over.

                    TERESA
          Let’s go, let’s go, we’re gonna be
          late for church. Austin, eat your
          toast, I told you a hundred times.

                    AUSTIN
          No, you told me four times...

                    TERESA
          Scott?

                    SCOTT
          What? I have golf.

                    TERESA
          No, you’re coming. We’re a family,
          we need to do family things...
          Especially now.

                    SCOTT
          But. I don’t even know anyone there.

                    TERESA
          Exactly, and it’s weird no one
          knows my husband. Come. On.

Scott relents. Totally bummed.


EXT. CHURCH - MORNING

Congregants file in. Scott holds Austin’s hand, Teresa
carries Logan.

                    AUSTIN
          I gotta poop!

Teresa checks Logan’s pants.
                                                          41.


                    TERESA
          And his diaper’s full.

Scott SIGHS. I got it.


INT. CHURCH - BATHROOM - MORNING

Scott has Logan laid out on the bathroom floor, changing his
diaper. IN A STALL, Austin FLUSHES.

                    AUSTIN
          I did it, Dadio. All good, no
          worries, no more poop, Auz Man
          wins!

He bursts from the stall without pants on. Just a pull-up
diaper, half hanging off. He goes for the door.

                    SCOTT
          Auz, no! Wait here with me. And put
          your pants on.

But Austin just runs in circles, chanting --

                    AUSTIN
          No more poop, Auz Man wins!

A MAN STEPS from another stall. Finds Austin half-naked
running in crazy circles, Scott and Logan on the floor.

                    MAN
          Need some help here?

                    SCOTT
          Nah. Sorry, we’re... new. I was
          kinda forced here against my will.

                    MAN
              (friendly grin)
          I’ve often felt the same.

He walks out, shuts the door behind him. Auz reaches for the
knob. Scott eyes him.

                    SCOTT
          Don’t.

But Auz just grins, twists the knob and bolts out.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          NO!!
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                42.


Scott panics. What do I do?? He grabs Logan, covers his naked
butt with a paper towel, runs after Austin.


INT. CHURCH - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Scott runs into the hall, naked Logan in hand. He spots Auz
about to turn a corner to the foyer, where EVERYONE CHATTERS.

Scott glares at Austin. Don’t you dare. Auz looks right back
at him. Eyes bright, blue and full of life and joy. In this
moment, time seems to stand still, and they connect.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          See that? He saw me. For just a
          second. That was the first time.

Then Auz flashes a mischievous smile, and bolts. Scott chases.

IN THE FOYER, Scott runs around the corner....

                    SCOTT
          Damn it, Austin! Get back here!

He skids to a stop, sweating, naked baby in his hands. Austin
stands before a group of parishioners, no pants, diaper on
backwards. Everyone stares. Teresa’s sister Lori CRACKS UP.      *

                    LORI                                         *
          Well hello there, peanut!                              *

Scott’s face goes red. WE HOLD ON THIS.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Dad says sometimes he thinks God
          is laughing at him. I think he’s
          laughing WITH him.

In the crowd, Teresa turns, sees her boys. She shakes her
head. Steps to Austin, takes his hand. Then introduces Scott
to the man she’s talking to. It’s the man from the bathroom.

                    TERESA
          Scott, this is Preacher Rick.

                    SCOTT
              (nods, great)
          Of course it is.

Rick just laughs, pats him on the arm.

                    PREACHER RICK
          Nice to meet you, Scott.... And
          hey, well handled.
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                  43.


Scott narrows his eyes at Austin. You won this time. Auz just
grins back, innocent. OVER THIS: “Haaappy birthday to you...”


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Austin sits before a cake with a giant SpongeBob candle in
the shape of a 5. Scott, Teresa and Logan (3) SING TO HIM.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          One, two, three, four, five. Five
          years of Austin. Five year plan.

WE PUSH IN on the ‘5’ candle.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Dad never got to go to Manhattan or                   *
          be in a rock band or work for an ad                   *
          agency or drive a green Volvo.                        *

CLOSE ON SCOTT, singing. He looks generally happy. But with
that slight malaise of young parenthood.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          He said plans change. And it was
          fine. Fine means good. Good means
          happy.

Austin blows out the candle. From this --

WE PAN ACROSS A SERIES OF CASTS AND BRACES, lined up in
Austin’s room like trophies.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          After that, more birthdays, more
          years, more broken bones. Break #19
          I fell off my bike, break #22 was
          the sled. I think 27 was the closet
          door, I’m not sure. After a while
          you kinda get used to it.

12-YEAR OLD AUSTIN yells to his parents in the kitchen.

                    AUSTIN (O.S.)
          Dad! I broke my finger!

Dad eats a sandwich. Looks to Teresa.

                    TERESA
          Your turn. I’m going shopping.
                                                           44.


                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          One time it even happened to Dad
          and me and Mom, all in the same
          week. Dad called that the trifecta.

THE THREE OF THEM EXIT THE HOSPITAL TOGETHER IN SLO MO. Auz
in a wheelchair, Dad in a sling, Mom with crutches.

We push in on AUSTIN, NOW 13, same age as the opening scene.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S HOUSE - MORNING

Hectic morning. Austin scurries around the kitchen, opening
cabinets. LOGAN is 11, athletic, but small for his age.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Now I’m 13. I flipping love 13.
          Friday the 13th, Ocean’s 13. Apollo
          13, you kiddin’ me, best Tom Hanks
          movie ever! Also, this is when I
          started eighth grade. I had
          flapjacks for breakfast. And I
          almost killed Mom.

Teresa hurries into the kitchen.

                    TERESA
          Come on guys, you really want to be
          late on your first day?

She stops. All the kitchen cabinets are open. Dozens of cups
and mugs and glasses scattered all over the counters.

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          Austin, what is this??

Austin wears new school clothes. Bright green pants, red
striped shirt. A tie. All very over-the-top. Perfect.

                    AUSTIN
          The pancake box say two cups of
          mix. But it doesn’t say which cups.

                    TERESA
          You’re killing me, Auz.

Austin freezes. His face goes white and he runs to his room.


INT. AUSTIN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Scott pops his head in. Finds Austin sitting on the bed,
sobbing. Inconsolable. Clutching his pet lizard, MARTY.
                                                           45.


                    SCOTT
          Hey, hey. What’s up? We gotta go.

                    AUSTIN
              (through wracked tears)
          I can’t go to school... Mom’s dying!

                    SCOTT
          She’s what?

                    AUSTIN
          She’s DYING. And it’s my fault. I’m
          killing her!

Scott realizes, tries not to laugh. Takes Austin in his arms.

                    SCOTT
          No. No, Auz. Mom is fine. I
          promise, she’s not gonna die. You
          believe me?

Austin catches his breath. Wipes his nose over and over.
Nods. Scott takes the lizard, places him in his terrarium.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Ok. Now let’s put Marty back. Wanna
          choose a hat?

Austin perks up, looks to his wall of hats. CUT TO:


INT. SCOTT’S CAR - MORNING

Austin in the passenger seat, Jester hat flapping in the
window. Dad drives, Logan in the back. Austin is pumped.

                    AUSTIN
          You’re gonna love middle school,
          Logan, just wait! The hallways are
          SO big, the teachers are the bomb
          and all the food is ala cart!


EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING

School BUZZES with first day energy. Scott pulls up and
Austin bounds from the car. Scott eyes his hat, concerned.

                    SCOTT
          Maybe no hat on your first day.
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                   46.


                    AUSTIN
          Don’t be a goober, Dadio. Jester is
          the best one. It’s the Mountain Dew
          Code Red of hats.

Scott looks to Logan.

                    LOGAN
          He’ll be fine. Let’s go, big
          brother. Show me everything.

As Logan takes Austin by the hand, UPBEAT MUSIC KICKS IN --


INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

Austin rushes through the hallway in his big colorful hat,
greeting and hugging everyone. Some kids give him looks and      *
avoid him, but most of them light up. “Auz Man!!!” “How was      *
your summer? Missed you, pal!” When the bell rings he’s          *
hugging the last remaining kid in the hallway.                   *

                    AUSTIN                                       *
          School is hard but it’s WORTH IT.                      *
          You’re gonna do great!                                 *


INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

AT LUNCH, Austin selects his food, a la carte. The best! He
goes on and on about it to everyone around him.

                    AUSTIN
          You can pick whatever you want. Ala
          carte flippin’ rocks.

But the kid in front of him is not charmed. This is TYLER,
14. Big for middle school. Tall and athletic. A bully.

FROM ACROSS THE CAFETERIA, Logan watches, concerned. As
Austin tags along Tyler and his buddies. They’re clearly
laughing at him, flicking his hat. Logan steps over.

                    LOGAN
          Everything okay, Auz?

                    AUSTIN
          Logan! This is Tyler. He said we
          can be best friends, all I have to
          do is shut up!

Logan steps to Tyler.
                                                           47.


                    LOGAN
          Hey man, that’s my brother. He’s
          autistic.

                    AUSTIN
          I’m autistic. True fact!

Tyler nods to his buddies.

                    TYLER
          Told you he’s one of those.
              (to Logan)
          And what’s your excuse? Still
          waiting on puberty?

His friends crack up. Logan wants to punch this kid, but
Tyler is twice his size. So he takes Austin’s hand.

                    LOGAN
          Come on, Auz Man.

                       AUSTIN
          Wait!

Austin doubles back and bearhugs Tyler.

                    AUSTIN (CONT'D)
          See you in class, Tyler, glad we’re
          best friends! Please, thank you,
          you’re welcome, I love you!

Logan and Austin walk off, hand in hand. The poor bully
doesn’t know what to do.


INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

EXTREME CLOSE ON A ZIPPER. Zipping. Unzipping. Austin stares.
Each tooth CLICKING. The sound, the texture. ZIP, ZIPP, ZIPPP

WIDER, we see Austin at his desk. A girl in front of him
fiddles with her jacket zipper. The teacher drones on, Austin
hears none of it. All he sees and hears is: ZIP, ZIPP, ZIPPP.

                    TEACHER (O.S.)
          Austin. Austin?

The ZIPPING finally stops.

                    TEACHER (CONT'D)
          Earth to Austin. Are you with us?

Austin snaps out of it. Looks up. Everyone stares at him,
including TYLER, who snickers.
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                  48.


                    TYLER
          I think his brain’s on another
          planet.

                    AUSTIN
          No. My brain is right here in my
          head. On Earth.

The class LAUGHS. Good joke. Austin laughs too, but doesn’t
understand why. Then he looks right back to the ZIPPER.


EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - END OF DAY

Scott picks them up outside school. Austin seems happy, which
is a relief. Scott looks to Logan, checking in.

                    SCOTT
          How was it?

                    LOGAN
          It was good.

                    AUSTIN
          No, it was GREAT. I made a new best
          friend, Dad! His name is Tyler.

Logan gives Dad a reassuring nod.

                    LOGAN
          It was fine.

                    SCOTT
          Well, good. Fine is good.


INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Scott and Teresa prep dinner together. An old Huey Lewis and    *
the News song plays on the radio.                               *

                    SCOTT
          No meltdowns. No calls from
          teachers. So... success.

They high five. Teresa grooves to the music, enjoying a
moment of peace. Then Austin enters like a whirlwind.

                    AUSTIN
          When is dinner? Is that what’s for
          dinner? Is that meat? Is that pot
          roast or poop with white sprinkles?
          Hey, are werewolves real? What if we
          had one in Iowa?
                    (MORE)
                      Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                 49.

                    AUSTIN (CONT'D)
          I just know they are real. Dad, I
          think I have a migraine. Do you have
          a migraine? Why do we get migraines?
          It’s probably because I talk too
          much and my cortex can’t keep up. I
          am such a dork, aren’t I? Do you
          love me, Dad? Please tell me you
          love me.
              (doesn’t wait for an answer)
          Werewolves must be so cool. I bet
          they have one at the zoo. If they
          don’t you have to get them one. I
          would love to meet a werewolf and
          invite him to lunch.

He paces, rattling on. It’s exhausting. JOE HIDES IN THE
CORNER, wearing giant noise reduction headphones.

                    AUSTIN (CONT'D)
          Is Bruce Lee Chinese? Oh, I know he
          is. If he were alive would he still
          be Chinese? Or is he Japanese? Either
          way.... he could come to lunch.

As he talks, Scott and Teresa look to each other. They’re
gonna lose their minds. Teresa mumbles...

                    TERESA
          Someone has to do something, right?

They quickly do Rock-Paper-Scissors. Scott loses. Damn.

                    SCOTT
          Hey, Auz Man. Austin, Dude. Listen                     *
          to me. I have an idea. Look at me.                     *

Finally Austin stops, intrigued. Dad raises an eyebrow.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          You wanna fly?

Austin’s eyes light up. FROM THIS:


EXT. BLUE SKY - DAY

Austin is FLYING. He sails through the air like a super hero,
backlit by the orange afternoon sun. Jester hat fluttering.

Then Scott flies beside him. No wires, no tricks, these guys
are flying! And to make it even cooler, A SUPER HERO THEME
PLAYS. It’s magical, and AUSTIN’S FACE BEAMS with pure joy.
                       Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                50.


                    AUSTIN
          Flying is so easy, Dad! I’m
          surprised more kids don’t do it.

Just as we’re wondering what the heck is going on here,
WE CUT TO REALITY. Which is --


EXT. PARK SWING SET - SUNSET

They’re on swings. Logan pushes Austin and Scott, one at a
time. Higher and higher. Austin is LOVING IT.

Then Logan pushes Scott really hard and runs under his swing.
He doubles back and does it again.

                    SCOTT
          Logan, you’re getting strong! Look                     *
          how high we’re going!

                    AUSTIN
          Higher! Go higher!

BACK TO FLYING FANTASY. Scott soars through the air again. He
looks over to Austin. But it’s Logan flying beside him now.
Scott grins, then hesitates. Something isn’t right.

                       AUSTIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Higher!

As Scott realizes, the fantasy crumbles.

BACK TO REALITY. Austin pushes Scott now. As Scott’s swing
goes high, Austin tries to run under him like Logan did. But--

                       SCOTT
          AUZ, NO!!!

Austin isn’t fast enough, and Scott swings back down,
SMASHING into Austin’s little body like a freight train.

There’s a THUD, then a horrible CRACK. Scott lands on top of
Austin with his full weight.

Austin is already BAWLING, his mouth wide open but no sound
coming out. Scott looks down with horror at Austin’s twisted
body. Austin stares back at him, in shock.

                    AUSTIN
          Daddy, I can’t move. Why did you do
          that to me? I hurt really bad. Why
          did you hurt me???

Logan stands frozen. He knows it’s bad. Scott yells to him.
                                                           51.


                    SCOTT
          Logan, go get my phone, fast as you
          can. Tell Mom Austin is hurt. Go!

Logan snaps out of it. Sprints off. Scott cradles Austin in
his arms. The Jester hat now crushed beneath his little body.

                    AUSTIN
          I’m sorry, Daddy. I just wanted to
          be strong.... Like Logan.

                    SCOTT
          It’s alright, Auz Man. You’re so
          strong. You’re gonna be alright, ok?

But his eyes betray him. He’s terrified.

IN A FEW HORRIBLE FLASHES, we see AUSTIN’S POV, DREAMLIKE:

- PARAMEDICS LEAN OVER HIM, loading him onto a stretcher.

- IN AN AMBULANCE, Scott covers his face, stifling sobs.

- ROLLING THROUGH A HOSPITAL. Teresa and Scott run alongside.
Teresa’s eyes wild with fear. She yells at Scott.

                    TERESA
          What happened? What did you do???

- As the stretcher pushes through double doors to the ER,
Scott collapses to the hallway floor in tears.


INT. HOSPITAL - CHAPEL - NIGHT

Teresa kneels alone in the chapel. Praying desperately.

                    TERESA
          Please, please God.... PLEASE....
          let him walk. Please...

Scott steps in, his face all shame. He sits beside her.
Doesn’t know what to do or say. Teresa feels his presence.

                    SCOTT
          I was trying to do something fun. I
          didn’t... I just didn’t see him.
              (no answer)
          It happens, T. It could have
          happened on your watch, too...

She turns on him.
                                                        52.


                       TERESA
             But it didn’t, and it doesn’t. Ever
             notice that?! It’s always you.

She storms out. Leaving Joe alone. Well, alone with Joe, who
now sits beside him. After a long, awkward silence.

                       JOE
             You are not a terrible father.

Scott nods, wanting to believe that.

                       JOE (CONT'D)
             You are not the worst person ever.
             You are not selfish. And reckless.
             And foolish. And irresponsible...

                       SCOTT
             Okay, Joe. Thank you.

A beat.

                       JOE
             You think he’s gonna be okay?

OFF THIS -

                       AUSTIN (O.S.)
             I’m BATMAAAAN!!


INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

Austin runs into the waiting room in a custom-made carbon
fiber sleeveless upper body cast. Like a bullet-proof vest.
It’s pretty cool. Teresa rushes to him, relieved.

                       DOCTOR
             He spent the whole day cheering up
             the nurses, reassuring them he’s
             fine. He’ll need to wear the cast
             for a few months while the
             vertebrae heal. But as you can see,
             he doesn’t seem to mind too much.

Austin’s cast is already signed by all the hospital staff.
And there’s a giant Batman symbol drawn on the chest.

                       DOCTOR (CONT'D)
             You’re a remarkable kid, Austin.

                       AUSTIN
             Oh, I’m not Austin.
                                                           53.


                    SCOTT
          If you’re not Austin, then -- “What
          are you?”

Austin pulls him by the collar. Face to face.

                    AUSTIN
          “I’m Batman!”

Scott and the nurses LAUGH. But Teresa is still reeling.


EXT. SCOTT AND TERESA HOME - EARLY MORNING

Scott zips up his suitcase, grabs his jacket. Teresa follows
him to the front door.

                    TERESA
          They really need you? In Topeka?

                    SCOTT
          It’s my job, T, I have to go.

                    TERESA
          No, you GET to go. And you get to
          bike and golf and fish, and I’m
          always stuck here. With the kids.

He stops, looks at her. Seriously?

                    SCOTT
          You could do other things.

                    TERESA
          I broke my ankle last time we took
          a walk, Scott.

                    SCOTT
          I don’t know what you want me to
          say. I’m late for the airport.

                    TERESA
          Just go. It’s ok, I’m sorry, I’m
          just... I love you. Go.

                    SCOTT
          Ok. Love you, too.

But it doesn’t feel that way.
                       Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                54.


INT. PLANE - MORNING

CLOSE ON SCOTT’S FEET, tapping. His work colleague MILES
plops in the seat beside him. Coffee in hand. Scott is
already buzzed, working on three mini vodkas.

                    MILES
          Morning, Scott.

                    SCOTT
          Miles.
              (slurring a little)
          Huh.... Your name is Miles. I just
          realized that.

                    MILES
          Realized what?

                    SCOTT
          We’re on a plane. There’s a joke
          there somewhere, right?

Miles helps him out.

                    MILES
          Frequent flier Miles.

                       SCOTT
          That’s it!

He offers Miles a vodka. Miles holds up his coffee. Scott
shrugs, downs it himself. Miles eyes him, a bit concerned.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S HOME - DAY

Teresa walks the house, picking up laundry. Clearing messy
counter tops, toys, dishes. It’s unending.

IN HER ROOM, she straightens a large collection of Beanie
Babies. Opens UPS packages: new clothes, makeup, Air Jordans.

                    TERESA
          Auz, new sneakers!

Austin runs in, stoked. Grabs them, runs out. Mom just shrugs.

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          “Thanks, Mom!” “Oh, you’re welcome.”                   *
          “Love you!” “Love you, too.”                           *

IN THE DEN, she sorts mail. Opens a drawer, adds bills to a
large stack. Some OVERDUE. She closes the drawer. Sits alone
for a long beat. Exhales. Depressed.
                       Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                55.


Finally she gets up. Clicks on the stereo. Finds a hard rock
station. Aerosmith. YES! She CRANKS IT UP. Starts dancing        *
alone. Like a teenager at a club. Blowing off steam.

Austin runs in, wearing his new sneakers. And his hat. He
joins her, excited. He’s not letting his body cast slow him
down a bit. They dance together. Crazy, silly dancing. It’s
cathartic. Then Logan storms in, annoyed.

                    LOGAN
          Mom. MOM!!!
              (turns the music off)
          I’m trying to study!

They freeze, busted. Logan leaves. Then Teresa starts dancing
again, without the music. Austin is right there with her.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA BEDROOM - NIGHT

Teresa sits up in bed, on her laptop. Online shopping. She
clicks BUY on a $100 Beanie Baby. SIGHS. Closes the laptop.
Opens it. Adds another one to the cart. Closes it again.
SIGHS again. Then clicks off the light and goes to sleep.


INT. TOPEKA BAR - NIGHT

Scott and Miles hang at a hotel bar. Miles finishes a beer.

                    SCOTT
          Another round.

                    MILES
          Dude, we have like six hours until
          the meeting. Don’t know how you do
          it. I’m out.

He pats Scott on the shoulder and heads to the elevator.

                       JOE (O.S.)
          I’m in.

Scott turns to find JOE STANDING BESIDE HIM. Scott grins.

                       SCOTT
          Bartender!

AT THE ELEVATOR, Miles gives one more look back at Scott.
Clearly worried. WE PUSH IN ON SCOTT. His eyes blurry, his       *
face slack. He takes another drink. Over this:

                    TERESA (PRE-LAP)
          Without any notice?
                                                             56.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

Scott pours himself WINE. He’s home now. Teresa paces, upset.

                    SCOTT
          They said the company “needs
          someone more available for travel”
          or whatever. Apparently I’ve had
          too many distractions lately.
          Austin, everything...

                    TERESA
          Is that all they said? Nothing
          about missing meetings, being late?

She eyes his glass of wine. Scott rises, annoyed.

                    SCOTT
          They don’t want a family man, T.
          They want some young kid who can
          commit his whole life to this
          stupid job. That’s not me anymore.

                    TERESA
          So what now?

                    SCOTT
          I get three months severance. We’ll
          make do. Cut back while I find
          something else.

He walks out. Taking his wine with him. Then, Austin’s VO:

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          You’re lucky if you have a dad
          without a job. Know why? He’s home
          ALL THE TIME...


EXT. FRONT YARD - DAY

Scott mows the lawn. Austin tracks with him    -- TALKING.

                    AUSTIN
          Dad, know what I was thinking?
          Thinking is weird. Thoughts happen
          in your brain but you can’t see
          them. When I think things sometimes
          I look up and think I’ll see the
          things I’m thinking but there’s
          nothing there. The things I think
          are invisible. Isn’t that so weird?

Scott just stares forward, tuning him out.
                                                        57.


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT

Teresa unpacks large boxes of makeup products onto basement
shelves. Austin stacks them all perfectly. One by one.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Then Mom started her own business
          selling her favorite make-up
          products to other people. And she
          worked from home, so she was around
          all the time, too!

So Austin talks her ear off, too.

                    AUSTIN
          Mom, do you know that no one owns
          ducks? So we could just pick up a
          duck and bring it home and it would
          be our duck....


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

HALLOWEEN. Scott and family trick or treat. Austin is dressed
as the IRON GIANT, his body cast painted silver. Logan is a
BASKETBALL STAR, Teresa is LARA CROFT.

As they knock on doors, Scott sits on a curb in a UNICORN
ONESIE. Joe beside him, as Tyler Durden from Fight Club.

                    JOE
          Hey, man, why the long face?

                    SCOTT
          Whadya mean? I’m fine. I think I’m
          fine, how would I know?

He pulls out a flask from his unicorn pocket. Takes a swig.
Joe points to the kids, collecting candy, having a blast.

                    JOE
          Look. Look at them. Adorable. Go
          engage.

                    SCOTT
          What is it with you, always in my
          business?

                    JOE
          I’m just saying, you have a
          tendency to retreat.
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                58.


                    SCOTT
          Maybe I think they’ll have more fun
          without me.

He takes another swig. Joe eyes the flask.

                    JOE
          Careful, you’re gonna get busted.

                    SCOTT
              (scoffs)
          Please. I’m a grown ass man.

Joe flicks his unicorn horn.

                    JOE
          Yes. Yes, you are.

Austin runs over, GIDDY, his candy bag stuffed. Scott quickly
stashes his flask and smiles. From this, A BULLHORN BLAST:


INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

Middle School basketball game. Scattered crowd. HALFTIME
MUSIC PLAYS. Logan sits with his teammates, including TYLER.    *

BY THE BLEACHERS, Austin wears the mascot TIGER COSTUME. Dad
holds the head for him as Austin fiddles with the velcro in
the back. Nervous.

                    SCOTT
          You sure about this? That’s a lot
          of people out there.

                    AUSTIN
          Don’t be a goober, Dad. Team Mascot
          is the greatest honor there is.

                    SCOTT
          Okay, just... stop with the velcro.

He helps put the head on, and Austin runs out.

ON THE COURT - Austin dances for the crowd. Having a blast.

But he can’t stop fiddling with the velcro, and it looks like
he’s doing some weird butt dance. The crowd CRACKS UP. But
he’s not trying to be funny. On the bleachers, Tyler and his    *
buddies chuckle. Logan sees, but looks away, embarrassed.       *

AUSTIN POV, INSIDE THE HEAD -- People laughing. Pointing.
CHEERING. It’s SO LOUD. They look distorted. Scary, even.
                     Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)               59.


                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Here’s a true fact about me. Some
          times a happy moment feels sad and
          sometimes a sad moment feels happy.

Auz suddenly stops, mid-dance. Then walks to the bench and
sits, head down. Music still plays, but the court is empty.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          I don’t always know why, I don’t
          always understand. That’s just what
          it’s like to be Austin.

People CHEER for him anyway, but when Austin takes the head
off, we see tears in his eyes. No one else notices. But Scott
does. He pushes through the crowd and sits beside Austin.

                    SCOTT
          Hey, dude. You did great. And look.                   *
          All that...
              (points to LAUGHING fans)
          ...that means they loved it.
          They’re laughing because you made
          them happy. They’re laughing WITH
          you, not at you.

Austin looks around more. Processing that.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          So go on. Finish your dance.

                     AUSTIN
          I can’t.

                    SCOTT
          Yeah you can. Watch.

Scott gets up, puts the head on and prances out. Doing
Austin’s silly dance. People start to clap. Scott grins at
Austin. Come on! And Austin finally runs out to join him.

And they dance together. Scott wearing the head, Austin
wearing the body. THE MUSIC ENDS and Scott beams at Austin.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Nailed it! Love you, Auz Man.                         *

He opens his arms for a hug, but Austin just squints back at
him, curious. Then -

                    AUSTIN
          You have something in your teeth.
                                                        60.


And he bounds off. Scott shakes his head. Disappointed. Not
the moment he was hoping for.


EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT

Austin and Logan wait for Scott to pull up the car. Logan
pulls Austin along on his skateboard, teaching him to
balance. Suddenly Austin stops, looks at Logan.

                    AUSTIN
          Is it hard being my brother?

Logan pauses, surprised by the question. He thinks.

                    LOGAN
          No. It’s an honor being your brother.
          And sometimes annoying. But mostly
          it’s an honor.

Tyler approaches, grinning sarcastically.

                    TYLER
          Sure that’s a good idea, Auz Man?
          Don’t want to break anything. Or
          everything.

                    AUSTIN
          Tyler! Hi. Wanna ride??

But Logan pulls Tyler aside.

                    LOGAN
          Leave him alone. He doesn’t
          understand. About you.

                    TYLER
          Oh yeah? Understand what?

                    LOGAN
          Even though you look big, you’re
          actually really small.

Tyler steps close, gets in Logan’s face. Logan doesn’t back
down. But A CAR HORN breaks the moment.

                    SCOTT (O.S.)
          Everything okay over there?

                    LOGAN
          Hey, Dad. Fine.

Tyler SCOFFS, walks away. As Logan and Auz climb in the car,
Dad eyes Logan, aware.
                                                         61.


                    SCOTT
          That’s Tyler?

                    LOGAN
          That’s Tyler.


EXT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Scott parks in the driveway. He jams burger wrappers into a
fast food bag as Logan and Austin file out --

                    SCOTT
          Not a word to Mom, remember? Boys?

                    AUSTIN
          Not what word?

                    LOGAN
          He means don’t mention the burgers.

As they enter the house, Scott looks to the curb. Frowns.

                    SCOTT (PRE-LAP)
          Where are the bins?


INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Scott quickly stuffs the wrappers in the kitchen trash. Turns
to Teresa, hoping he’s not busted.

                    SCOTT
          The trash bins. They’re not out
          there.

Teresa hesitates. She’s the one who looks busted.

                    TERESA
          They’re uhhh.... they took them.

                    SCOTT
          Who took them?

                    TERESA
          The company, the trash company.
          They came today, they took them.

Off Scott’s VERY confused face, WE CUT TO:

A PILE OF UNPAID BILLS drops on the table. Scott pours
himself a full glass of wine, angry.
                                                    62.


                    SCOTT
          So you just didn’t pay them? Any of
          them?

                    TERESA
          I’ve been trying to keep up, but...
          all the surgeries and medications
          and therapists, I had to start
          putting it on cards, then the cards
          raised the rates, and it just...
          got out of hand.

                    SCOTT
          They took our TRASH CANS, Teresa!
          I’ve never even heard of that! And
          you’re off buying Austin twenty
          different pairs of shoes and Star
          Wars crap and DVDs and... a million
          “bean bag babies!”

                    TERESA
          Beanie Babies. They’re an
          investment! And it’s not just me,
          you know, all your hobbies and
          gadgets and country club
          memberships, how did you think we
          were paying for everything?

                    SCOTT
          I didn’t KNOW, Teresa!

                    TERESA
          You didn’t WANT to know!

AUSTIN WATCHES THEM from the other room, curious.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Sometimes Mom and Dad yell when they
          talk. Mom says Dad doesn’t hear a
          word she says, which is impossible,
          because she says the words so loud.

Scott gulps down his wine, refills the glass.

                    TERESA
          I’ve been all alone here, you know?
          And maybe everyone else has it all
          figured out -- life, money, raising
          kids -- but I don’t, I have no
          clue. It’s just too much!

                     SCOTT
          Too much??
              (grabs the bills)
                     (MORE)
                       Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)              63.

                       SCOTT (CONT'D)
             SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS, Teresa!
             How the hell are we gonna pay this??

                       TERESA
             Stop yelling! You look like my Dad
             when you yell!

                       SCOTT
             We could lose our home!!

                       TERESA
             STOP YELLING!

Scott suddenly throws his wine glass against the kitchen
wall. It EXPLODES, spraying red wine and glass everywhere.
Teresa SCREAMS.

ANGLE ON AUSTIN, standing in the doorway.

                       TERESA (CONT'D)
             Don’t come in here, there’s glass!

She runs to Austin. Studies his face, worried that he’s
scared. He has an odd look, like he wants to say something.

                       TERESA (CONT'D)
             You okay, Auz?

Finally --

                       AUSTIN
             We had Burger Star for dinner.

                       TERESA
             Oh. Oh, that’s fine, honey.

Austin shuffles from the room. Scott looks from the broken     *
glass to the bills. Lowers his voice.                          *

                       SCOTT                                   *
             We can’t pay all this.                            *

                       TERESA                                  *
             What choice do we have?                           *

                       SCOTT                                   *
             We’ll negotiate. There are firms                  *
             that do that. We need to talk to                  *
             someone.                                          *

Teresa nods, starts cleaning up the mess. Scott sighs,         *
feeling bad. He joins her.                                     *
                     Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)               64.


                    AUSTIN (V.O.)                               *
          Here’s another true fact. Sometimes                   *
          if you spend too much money, you have                 *
          to spend more money for someone to                    *
          help you spend less money on the                      *
          money you already spent.                              *


INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY                    *

Scott sits at his desk, a stack of paperwork in front of him.
Phone to his ear. He waits, annoyed, as it RINGS and RINGS.

                    TERESA
          Give him a little more time, maybe
          he’s still working on it.

                    SCOTT
          He’s not working on anything, he
          took my 5 grand and stopped
          answering my calls. He’s not gonna
          save us “forty thousand dollars”,
          he’s not gonna save us a dime, he
          scammed us!

Scott rubs his temples, thinking. Then he hangs up the phone
and grabs his keys, determined.

                     SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Come on.


EXT. STRIP MALL - CONTINUOUS

SCOTT’S CAR pulls into a spot at a strip mall. He turns to
the kids in the back.

                    SCOTT
          Stay here. We’ll be right back.

Scott and Teresa jump from the car. They climb stairs, find
an office marked “Fast and Friendly Mortgage/Debt Relief”.

Scott tries the door. Locked. Blinds are closed, but still
swinging, like they were JUST closed.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Lyle! Open up. I know you’re in
          there!

Teresa points.

                     TERESA
          Scott!
                                                          65.


A guy in a cheap suit sneaks down a set of back stairs.

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          Go, go, go!

They run after him. The guy climbs into a brown Lincoln Town
Car and takes off.


INT. SCOTT’S CAR - MOMENT’S LATER

Scott and Teresa jump back in. Scott guns it.

AS HE RACES AFTER LYLE’S CAR, WE STAY ON AUSTIN’S FACE IN THE
BACK SEAT. The wind whips his hair, his eyes take in the cars
blurring by, FASTER AND FASTER. Over this shot, we hear:

                    SCOTT (O.S.)
          Hey!!! Lyle!! Pull over!!!

                    LOGAN (O.S.)
          Dad, what are we doing?

                    SCOTT (O.S.)
          Where is he, where’d he go??

                    TERESA (O.S.)
          There, behind the truck! He’s
          exiting! You lost him!

                      SCOTT
          Damn it!!

Finally the car slows. We pan to Dad, who looks back.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          You guys okay?

Logan looks rattled. But Austin is GRINNING ear to ear.

                    AUSTIN
          That was totally wicked! Go faster,
          Dadio! 88 MILES PER HOUUUUUR!!

A beat. And Teresa starts LAUGHING. Then Scott. The whole
thing is ridiculous. CLOSE ON AUSTIN, happy as can be.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          That was a great day. Top five
          family moments ever.
                                                        66.


EXT. SCOTT AND TERESA HOME - DAY

A FORECLOSURE SIGN in the lawn. A YARD SALE underway. Scott
and Teresa sit in folding chairs as strangers pick through
their belongings.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          But we never caught that man in the
          car. So other people got to have our
          house. And a bunch of our stuff.

Scott sips a beer, bitter, as someone eyes his mountain bike.

                    SCOTT
          No. Not for sale!


EXT. RENTAL HOUSE - DAY

A much smaller house in a much less desirable neighborhood. A
FOR RENT SIGN still pokes out from unraked leaves.

Teresa and the kids unload boxes from the cars. Scott carries
a mattress alone. Joe tries to help.

                    SCOTT
              (annoyed)
          I got it, I got it.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT

THANKSGIVING. Scott’s parents arrive, and Austin throws his
arms around them, no longer in his body cast.

                    SCOTT’S MOM
          Look at you. No cast!

                    AUSTIN
          I’m a free man!!

Scott’s father glances around. The living room is tiny. With
old carpeting. Boxes still stacked against wall.

AT THE TABLE, they all sit together. Ready to eat. Sharing
what they’re thankful for.

                    SCOTT’S DAD
          That my grand-rascals live right
          around the corner now, so I can
          visit whenever I want.
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                67.


                     AUSTIN
          I’m thankful for food. All of it,
          YUM! And no more cast. And also
          SpongeBob.

                    TERESA
          Well. I’m thankful for our new
          home.

She looks to Scott, trying to have a moment. But he’s already
halfway through a glass of wine. Not feeling it. He raises       *
his glass.

                    SCOTT
          Agreed. On all fronts. Let’s eat.


EXT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT

In the driveway, Logan shows off skateboard tricks for Austin.
Scott sits with his Dad on the front steps, drinking a beer.

                    SCOTT
          I don’t know, maybe I’m cursed.
          It’s always something. Another
          injury, another setback, another
          catastrophe. It’s just, it’s a lot.

                    DAD
          There’s a word for all that, you
          know?..... Life.

Scott scoffs. Please.

                    DAD (CONT'D)
          Now all you gotta do is learn to
          enjoy it.

Dad pats him on the shoulder, gets up to leave. He stops in
the doorway. Nods to Austin and Logan, LAUGHING in the yard.

                    DAD (CONT'D)
          And you’re right, son. It IS a lot.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Teresa cleans up the kitchen by herself. Austin comes
through, looking in cabinets, under the table.

                    AUSTIN (O.S.)
          DAD?? DADIO! Come on, you
          snickerdoodle. I know you’re
          hiding. Where ARE YOU??
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                   68.


Teresa mutters under her breath.

                    TERESA
          Bet I know where he is.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - SCOTT’S CLOSET - SAME MOMENT

In the closet, only half-unpacked. Scott sits alone, hiding.
Drinking. Eyes far off.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Teresa brushes her teeth. Scott stumbles in, drunk. Collapses
on the bed. Out cold. Teresa shakes her head with disgust.

                    TERESA
          Happy Thanksgiving.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Scott steps into the kitchen. Still blurry. Teresa stands at     *
the sink. Doesn’t turn around. Tucks her thumbs into her         *
fists, fidgeting.                                                *

                    SCOTT
          Where are the kids?

                    TERESA
          At a friend’s. No school, remember?

Then he notices a bunch of booze bottles on the counter.
Teresa’s pouring them all out.

                    SCOTT
          What’s this?

She stops, flexes her hands. Turns to face him, with resolve.    *

                    TERESA
          No more drinking.

Scott takes a moment with that. Looks at her, at the bottles.

                    SCOTT
          I didn’t know it was such a big
          deal to you. You never said
          anything.

                    TERESA
          There’s a lot I haven’t said.
                                                           69.


                    SCOTT
          Oh yeah? And why is that?

                    TERESA
          I don’t know.

                    SCOTT
          You don’t know?

She sets a bottle down. Okay.

                    TERESA
          Maybe because I haven’t had the
          guts. Maybe because I’ve been
          divorced twice already and I have
          two kids and I’m afraid I don’t
          have options. That I don’t deserve
          options. But you know what, I’m
          tired of living with a man who
          doesn’t respect me. Doesn’t respect
          himself. I won’t do it any more.

She sweeps all the bottles into a trash bag.

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          You stop this nonsense now, Scott. Or
          I’m done. DONE. Now take this out.

And she walks from the room. Scott just stands there holding
a bag of his empty booze bottles in his hand.

                    JOE (PRE-LAP)
          She’s not wrong. You do drink a lot.


EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

Scott and Joe putt the 8th hole. Lush, rolling hills all
around. It’s cold, but they don’t care.

                    SCOTT
          I drink exactly the amount you do.
          And it’s usually your idea.

                    JOE
          Yeah, well my ideas are your ideas.

Scott putts. Misses.

                    SCOTT
          People drink. Hell, she drinks, I
          never say a word. And she shops,
          and she plays her damn video games.
          Now THAT’S an addiction.
                       Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)             70.


                    JOE
          Who said anything about addiction?

                    SCOTT
          What? I don’t know.

                    JOE
          So why bring it up?

                    SCOTT
          I didn’t. You did.

Scott putts again. Misses again. Dang it.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - SCOTT AND TERESA BEDROOM - NIGHT

It’s late. Scott comes in quietly. Teresa is already in bed,
turned toward the wall. Asleep?

He watches her for a moment. Like he hasn’t seen her in a
while. He gently eases into bed, not wanting to disturb her.
Lays on his side, breathing with her. After a moment, she
reaches her hand back. Puts it on his. He takes it, and they
lay like that. Together but apart.

OVER THIS - Jingle Bell Rock.


INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAYS - DAY

Christmas season has begun. Lockers are decorated. Austin       *
runs through the halls, wearing the tiger mascot costume.       *
Hugs and high fives, everyone smiles, happy to see him.         *

                    AUSTIN                                      *
          Welcome back! How was your                            *
          Thanksgiving, mine was AH-MAZING.                     *
          Christmas is next, are you ready??                    *
          Auz Man loves you!                                    *


INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Austin bounds into class. He spots Tyler and sits beside him.

                    AUSTIN
          Tyler! What’s up, my man! Did you
          get my facebook messages? You
          didn’t write back, just wondered if
          you got them.

Tyler ignores him. But Austin doesn’t get the hint.
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                71.


                    AUSTIN (CONT'D)
          Do you want to come to my house
          after school and watch Yu-Gi-Oh?
          Are we still friends?

                    TYLER
              (super sarcastic)
          Yeah, Austin. BEST friends.

As the teacher starts in with class, Tyler looks to his buddy
and mouths “watch this”.

                    TYLER (CONT'D)
          Hey, Austin. You want answers?

Austin looks at him, doesn’t understand. Tyler leans close.

                    TYLER (CONT'D)
          “I want the truth!”

                    AUSTIN
              (gets it, lighting up)
          “You can’t handle the truth!”

-- and launches right into Jack Nicholson’s speech.

                    AUSTIN (CONT'D)
          “Son, we live in a world that has
          walls, and those walls have to be
          guarded by men with guns....”

                    TEACHER
          Alright, Austin. Let’s settle in.

But Austin can’t stop himself, and Tyler knows it.

                    AUSTIN
          “Who's gonna do it? You? You,
          Lieutenant Weinberg?”

                    TEACHER
          Thank you for the performance,
          Austin, that’s enough.

But Austin keeps rattling it off. Tyler and his buddy stifle
LAUGHTER. But the other kids feel bad for him.                  *

                    AUSTIN
          “I have a greater responsibility
          than you can possibly fathom. You
          weep for Santiago, and you curse the
          Marines. You have that luxury...”
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                72.


The teacher shakes Austin’s shoulder, and he JOLTS, rubs his
eyebrow, talking faster. He has to finish.

                     AUSTIN (CONT'D)
          “You don't want the truth because
          deep down in places you don't talk
          about at parties, you want me on
          that wall -- YOU NEED ME ON THAT
          WALL....!”

                    TEACHER
          Ok, I think you need a break. Would
          someone walk him down to the office?                 *

A NICE GIRL volunteers. Calmly helps Austin to the door.
Shooting Tyler a look. Austin claws at his face as he goes, in
full meltdown mode. It’s really sad. Even Tyler looks like he
feels bad. Classmates call out to Auz as he goes. ”You’re      *
okay, Auz man.” “We love you, dude.” FROM THIS:                *

                    TERESA (PRE-LAP)
          She called it a resource class.
          It’s for special needs kids!


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT

Teresa paces the house. Whispers into the phone, distraught.

                    TERESA
          She said they think it’s time, that
          it’s only gonna get harder, it’s
          not fair to him or the other kids.

She peeks in on Austin, who sits on his bed, obsessively re-
sorting his shoelace collection.

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          Apparently they have classrooms
          right there on campus. She said
          they can enroll him right away,
          like they’re doing us a favor.

                    SCOTT (V.O.)
          Maybe we just need to adjust his
          meds again. What did you say?

                    TERESA
          I didn’t know what to say! I
          agreed. Honestly, it didn’t sound
          like we really have a choice.
              (upset)
          Scott.... I think I just made the
          worst decision of my life.
                                                           73.


                    SCOTT (V.O.)
          No, T, relax, you always know
          what’s best for him.

                    TERESA
          Where are you?

                    SCOTT (V.O.)
          Just doing some Christmas shopping.
          I’ll be home soon. I love you.

                    TERESA
          Yeah, you too.

She hangs up, and we CUT TO SCOTT. He’s in:


INT. BAR - AFTERNOON

A local dive bar, glass of Scotch in hand. Alone, this time.
No sign of Joe. He hangs up his cell, looking guilty.


EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL CAMPUS - MORNING

Scott, Teresa and Austin follow an UNINSPIRED TEACHER to a
pre-fab trailer in the back of school property. They enter
the trailer, skeptical, to find --


INT. SPECIAL NEEDS CLASSROOM - DAY

A HECTIC, CHAOTIC classroom, filled with a mix of kids, some
with obvious disabilities, others with behavior and
discipline problems. The vibe is very bad.

Austin looks to his mom. Fidgeting.

                    AUSTIN
          But none of my friends are here.

Teresa doesn’t know what to say. On the verge of tears. Scott
tries to be encouraging.

                    SCOTT
          You’ll make new friends, Auz. You
          always make friends. Right?

It breaks their heart, but they hug Austin and walk out.
Austin stands alone, scared.

LATER. A fight breaks out between two kids. The teacher tries
to break it up, gets pushed backwards against a desk. Austin
cowers in the corner, clawing at his face, whimpering.
                                                        74.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT

Dinner. Austin sits at the table, dark. Mom scoops potatoes
on everyone’s plates. Austin pushes the spoon away.

                    AUSTIN
          I don’t want them.

                    TERESA
          What do you mean, you love mashed
          potatoes.

                    AUSTIN
          Well, now I hate them. They’re
          retarded.

                    TERESA
          Hey, don’t say that word.

                    AUSTIN
          Retarded. Retarded, retarded,
          retarded, retarded.

                    SCOTT
          Austin, stop it.

                    AUSTIN
          You stop it, asshole!

Logan spits his milk. Scott and Teresa are shocked.

                    SCOTT
          What is with you?! You want to go
          to bed early?

                    AUSTIN
          No. I don’t want to go to bed, I
          don’t want to go to school, I don’t
          want to go ANYWHERE!!

                    TERESA
          Hey hey hey. Calm down. Come here.

                    AUSTIN
          No. Don’t touch me, don’t come near
          me!

Teresa steps toward him and Austin WHIPS HIS GLASS AT HER,
hitting her square in the forehead with an awful THUNK.

Teresa stumbles back, stunned. Blood already flowing.

Scott jumps up, shocked, and runs to Austin, who pushes his
chair back, kicking and punching, going berserk.
                                                           75.


Logan tries to help, but Austin grips his brother by the
throat and starts choking him. Logan struggles, fighting to
free himself, his face turning beet red.

                    SCOTT
          Austin!! Stop it. Let him go. AUSTIN!!

Scott tries to pry his hands off, but Austin flails and
SCREECHES, his eyes going black like he’s possessed.

Teresa rushes over. It takes both of them, but Austin finally
releases his grip and Logan GASPS for air. Austin goes limp,
panting and crying. He whimpers to himself.

                    AUSTIN
          Please don’t make me go back to
          that room. They scare me, please
          don’t make me go back...

Teresa wipes the blood from her head. They all look to each
other, reeling. What just happened?? From this, the BUZZING
OF AN ELEVATOR --


INT. HOSPITAL - PSYCHIATRIC WARD - NIGHT

Revealing the sterile lobby of a psychiatric ward. Armed
guards stand before a large vault-like door.

Scott and Teresa escort Austin in. Still in shock.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          The doctor said I was taking the
          wrong medication and I was “under a
          lot of stress”, which means it was
          actually the medication that choked
          Logan, not me. Stupid medication.

Scott fills out paperwork as Teresa tries to soothe Austin.
He’s still agitated, so two nurses hold him down and give him
a shot. Finally his body goes slack and his eyes stare off.

A KIND-FACED DOCTOR emerges and speaks to Scott and Teresa.
They listen, through a fog.

Then a HORRIBLE GRINDING NOISE as the vault door slides open.
Two orderlies take Austin by either arm and lead him away.
Teresa and Scott try to follow, but the guard stops them.

They watch, helpless, as Austin looks back, confused. Why
aren’t you coming with me?
                                                        76.


                    TERESA
          It’s just a few days, Baby! The
          doctors need to make sure you’re ok,
          but we’ll be back in just a few days!

Austin’s face crumples up into abject terror, and he BURSTS
INTO TEARS. Then the door slowly swings shut, sealing them
off from their boy.

Teresa collapses to the floor. She SOBS, her back pressed
against the vault door, as close to Austin as she can get.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT

In a daze, Teresa, Scott and Logan decorate the house for
Christmas. They hang ornaments on a little tree.

                    LOGAN
          He’ll love it. When he gets back,
          he’ll be so happy.

CLOSE ON TERESA. Her eyes empty.


INT. HOSPITAL - PSYCHIATRIC WARD - NIGHT

Austin lies in a cot. Curled up, scared.

                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Sometimes we feel alone, even when
          we’re not.


EXT. GROCERY STORE - SAME MOMENT

Teresa climbs into her Mustang with a small bag of groceries.
She sits, trying to breathe, trying to hold it together.
Then she starts the car and pulls away.


INT. HOSPITAL - PSYCHIATRIC WARD - NIGHT

Lying in the dark, Austin starts singing to himself, soft and
quiet. Like Mom would do.

                    AUSTIN
          You are my sunshine, my only
          sunshine....
                                                          77.


EXT. DARK ROADS - NIGHT

Teresa speeds along dark, winding roads, eyes blurred with
tears. OVER THIS, Austin’s voice continues:

                    AUSTIN (O.S.)
          You make me happy when skies are
          grey...

Teresa drives faster and faster. She POUNDS the steering
wheel, unleashing bottled up rage. Then, in total
desperation, SHE CLOSES HER EYES AND LETS GO OF THE WHEEL.

Time slows down. All sound fades away, except Austin singing.

                    AUSTIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          ...You’ll never know dear, how
          much I love you. Please don’t take
          my sunshine away...

OUT THE WINDOW - The night blurs by.

CLOSE ON TERESA’S FACE. Wet with tears. Eyes clenched shut.

FROM THIS, WE SEE FLASHES. MEMORIES:

BABY AUSTIN in Teresa’s arms. Teresa doing dishes, 2 YEAR-OLD
AUSTIN plays on the floor. AUSTIN AT 5, Teresa sings to him
at bedtime. Her voice blending with his in a haunting duet.

                    AUSTIN AND TERESA (O.S.)
          The other night, dear. As I lay
          sleeping, I dreampt I held you in
          my arms....

MORE FLASHES. Playing, crying, laughing. Scott with his
guitar, adding to the song. Connecting them all.

BACK TO TERESA’S FACE. Eyes still closed.

THEN TO THE ROAD. The car races for a drop off.

                    AUSTIN AND TERESA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          And now that you’re here, my dreams
          are waking...

A FINAL FLASH. 5-year old Austin. Giggling.

                    AUSTIN AND TERESA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          ...and I will keep you from all harm.

The tires hit the grooved edge of the pavement -
BBBBBRRRRZZZZT! - and snaps Teresa back to reality.
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                 78.


THE MUSIC CUTS OUT, replaced by SQUEELING, as Teresa slams on
the brakes and cranks the wheel.

The Mustang spins 360°, leaving a trail of black rubber. It
finally skids to a stop, inches from the edge.

INSIDE THE CAR, Teresa sits in silent shock. What did I just
do? Then she puts her head in her hands and cries. Over this:

                     PREACHER RICK (PRE-LAP)
          I know this must be really
          difficult right now, I can only
          imagine...


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - DAY

TERESA’S CHURCH FRIENDS, LORI and PREACHER RICK gather around   *
Teresa in the living room. Lori squeezes Teresa’s hand.         *

                    PREACHER RICK
          ...but we’re here for you, and with
          you.

Teresa nods, grateful. But still overwhelmed. She bows her
head....

                    TERESA
          I know you’re with him, God, I know
          he’s not alone. Thank you....

Scott and Joe watch from the doorway, super skeptical.

                    JOE
          Did she seriously just say Thank
          You to God right now?

AFTERWARD, Rick spots Scott on his way out.

                    PREACHER RICK
          Scott. Nice to see you. Hope you’re
          holding up okay.
              (a beat)
          And hey, if you need anything. I’m
          always around.

                    SCOTT
          Cool, yeah. Actually, one thing you
          could do for me. Tell God if he
          really feels the need to punish
          someone right now, how about punish
          me? I can handle it. Hell, I deserve
          it.
                    (MORE)
                                                        79.

                     SCOTT (CONT'D)
              (dark)
          But leave my wife and kid alone.

Rick nods, unfazed.

                    PREACHER RICK
          I’ll tell Him.

With that, Scott struts away. Joe chases after him.

                    JOE
          Oh snap! That was dope. You just
          told that preacher what’s WHAT!


INT. HOSPITAL - PSYCHIATRIC WARD - NIGHT

The vault door BUZZES open and the DOCTOR leads Scott and
Teresa into a community room.

                    KIND-FACED DOCTOR
          He’s been great. We’d kind of like
          to hire him, to be honest. I think
          everyone here will be sad to see
          him go...

THEY SEE -- Austin at a table, putting on a puppet show for a
collection of patients. All of them smiling. Austin sees his
parents and runs to them. Huge hugs.

                      AUSTIN
          Mom! Dad!

His eyes are clear, he looks bright and happy.

                    AUSTIN (CONT'D)
              (whispers, excited)
          There are some really, really
          messed up people in here. Want to
          meet them??

And before they can answer, Austin starts introducing them to
his new friends. Mom and Dad just smile, baffled as always.


INT. BURGER STAR - DAY

Scott, Teresa and Austin wait in line to order. Special treat
on the way home. Austin taps the man in front of him.

                    AUSTIN
          Hi, my name is Austin, Richard
          Austin LeRette. What are you going
          to have?
                    (MORE)
                                                        80.

                    AUSTIN (CONT'D)
          I’m having the number eleven.
          That’s the ten-piece nugget meal
          with fries and a drink. I plan on
          getting a strawberry milkshake for
          my drink, because there’s just
          something about a milkshake with
          nuggets that’s absolute perfection.
          For the fries I will get salt and
          pepper and ketchup. For the nuggets
          I will have ranch, honey mustard,
          buffalo, sweet and sour, barbecue,
          and more ranch, of course. Oh, I’ll
          get a lot of napkins, too. Please,
          thank you, and you’re welcome.

The man takes all that in. Scott just shrugs. That’s my son.

AT THE TABLE, Scott and Teresa watch as Auz digs in, MOANING
with delight at everything he eats. Fully in the moment.
Then, without warning, he looks up at them. Matter of fact.

                    AUSTIN (CONT'D)
          I’m not going back there again. Can
          I have more ranch dressing, please?

And that’s that.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - CHRISTMAS MORNING

They all open presents. Happy to be back together. Austin
holds his lizard MARTY, who wears a tiny Santa hat.

The tree is small, and the gifts are, too. Logan opens one.
It’s a NEW SKATEBOARD. He lights up.

                    SCOTT
          This one is lighter and more narrow,
          better for doing tricks...

                    LOGAN
          Awesome! Thanks, guys.

Austin rips open a present. A neon green bowtie.

                    TERESA
          It’s a bit of a small Christmas
          this year, but we thought you might
          want to add one to the collection.

                    AUSTIN
          You kidding, it’s the greatest gift
          I ever got!
                                                        81.


And he means it.

THAT NIGHT, Scott settles onto the couch beside Teresa. A
moment alone. He hands her an eggnog. CLINKS her glass.

                    SCOTT
          Don’t worry, no alcohol. So it’s not
          like it tastes good or anything.

A long beat.

                    TERESA
          There’s no way we’re sending him
          back to that classroom.

                    SCOTT
          I know.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNIING

A FLYER slams down on the table. CHURCH CAMPING TRIP.

                    AUSTIN
          Dad, look!! Father/Son camping trip
          in March. It’s annual, that means
          every year. We HAVE to go!!

Scott eyes the FLYER, skeptical.

                    SCOTT
          I don’t know, Auz. Don’t think it’s
          a good idea. You’d have to sleep in
          a tent, there are bugs, lots of
          kids doing things you might not be
          able to do.

                    AUSTIN
          But I CAN do it, Dad. PLEASE. I
          just want to do something normal.
          With normal kids. I don’t want to
          be “special”, I want to be like
          every other dude.
              (emotional)
          I want to go camping with my Daddy.

Scott hesitates. Austin can tell he’s got him on the hook.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Here’s a trick I know. If you
          really, really want something, just
          talk and talk and talk about it and
          whatever you do don’t stop talking
          and then you get it.
                                                        82.


Austin leans in harder now. Super earnest. Closing the deal.

                    AUSTIN
          It could be like an extra Christmas
          present, since this was a smaller
          Christmas because of money, and
          I’ve been so good, and I did have
          to spend four days in a mental
          institution, and I just really,
          really want to go camping with you.
          Please, please, PLEASE, Dadio!

Scott SIGHS. Looks to Teresa. She shrugs.

                    AUSTIN (CONT'D)
          YESSS!!


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - SCOTT AND TERESA BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

5am. Scott and Teresa wake up to Austin jumping on the bed.

                    AUSTIN
          Dad! Guess how many days until the
          camping trip? 19 and a half.

Scott exhales, bleary. Are you kidding me right now?

                    SCOTT
          No, Auz. The trip is in March.
          That’s like three months away.

                    AUSTIN
          Uh uh, because tonight is New Year’s
          Eve, and there’s a party, so we
          won’t even be thinking about
          camping, so tonight doesn’t count.
          And there’s eight weekends until
          the trip, and weekends don’t count
          because weekends are fun. And I’ll
          be sleeping nine hours of every
          day, so I won’t even feel those.
          And I have three friends’ birthday
          parties and then Batman vs.
          Superman comes out March 25, and
          it’s two hours and 32 minutes long,
          but with popcorn and trailers,
          that’s a solid three hours we won’t
          be thinking about ANYTHING else,
          and so none of that counts. Which
          leaves 19 and a half days until
          Father/Son Camping Weekend!!

And he runs out of the room. Scott looks to Teresa.
                                                        83.


                    SCOTT
          I really hate camping.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Scott and the kids are dressed up and ready for New Years.
Austin grabs his Jester hat. Mom lies on the couch in sweats,
not happy. She whispers to Scott.

                    TERESA
          You can’t just stay home?

                    SCOTT
          The kids want to see the fireworks,
          T, they want to have a fun night.

                    TERESA
          YOU want to have a fun night.

                    SCOTT
          We all do. You’ll just be resting
          anyway.

She shakes her head. Whatever. Then she smiles for the kids.

                    LOGAN
          You sure, Mom?

                    TERESA
          I took some Tylenol, I’ll be okay.
          Have fun, just be home by 11 so we
          can watch the ball drop together.

Austin gives her a quick kiss, bounds out the door.

                    AUSTIN
          Love you, Mama bear! Feel better.

Scott avoids her gaze. Shuts the door, annoyed.


EXT. IOWA COUNTRY CLUB PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Scott pulls his white Taurus into the Country Club valet.

They walk under a fancy archway to find a patio party in full
swing. A banner reads: HAPPY NEW YEAR!

Austin goes right for the food trays. Scott goes right for
the bar. WE’VE NOW REACHED THE OPENING SCENE.
                                                           84.


                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Here it is. This is the night I was
          telling you about, remember??

LATER, Scott makes small talk with some friends. Already
sloppy, talking too close. His parents are there. They say
goodnight early, and his Dad leans close.

                     SCOTT’S DAD
          Happy New Year, son. Take it easy
          with that.

He takes the drink from Scott’s hand as they leave. Scott
immediately grabs another one from a passing tray.

FIREWORKS EXPLODE IN THE SKY. Everyone OOH and AWWs. Austin
stares, transfixed.

Scott’s PHONE BUZZES. A text from Teresa. “It’s 11, you on
your way?” But he’s too far gone. He pops open a custom beer
bottle with a rubber stopper. Fancy.

Then he joins his kids on the dance floor. Stumbling in
sloppy circles, flailing his arms. Beer in hand. It’s not
charming. It’s embarrassing. Logan looks concerned, Austin
thinks it’s funny. He dances just as silly.

Then Scott gets dizzy and drops the bottle. It SHATTERS on
the floor. Ooops.


INT. IOWA COUNTRY CLUB - MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Scott stumbles in - propped up by Joe. Joe pushes him
against the sinks. Scott slaps him away, slurring.

                    SCOTT
          Off! Hands off, I’m fine.

And they have the fight we first saw as Scott talking to
himself.

                    JOE
          You are lost, my friend, your moral
          compass is broken. You’re failing
          as husband and a father.

Scott glares back, defiant. But there’s shame behind his eyes.

                    SCOTT
          Yeah? Who are you to judge me?!

Before Joe can answer, the door opens and an ELDERLY MAN
steps in. Scott straightens.
                                                           85.


                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Hey man, what’s up. Sweet tie.

The old man frowns, goes into a stall. Scott turns back.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          I’m going home.

He takes out his keys, but Joe grabs them. No way. They
struggle over the keys.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Give em back.

                    JOE
          No!

                    SCOTT
          Give em back!

                    JOE
          NO! Just cool it.

                    SCOTT
          I’m fine, I’m still in control.

                    JOE
          Great. Then let’s just walk back out
          there, sober up and go home. Ok?

                    SCOTT
          Ok.
              (reaches for the keys)
          I’ll drive.

                    JOE
          No, I’m not letting you behind the
          wheel.

                    SCOTT
          And I’m not asking your permission.

He reaches for the keys, but Joe pulls them away again. Scott
throws him against the wall. Angry.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          This is none of your business, Joe!
          It never is!

He grabs the keys and heads for the door. Turns around.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Don’t follow me. I mean it. I’m
          done with you.
                                                         86.


And he storms out. Joe stands there, like he really wants to
follow, but physically can’t.

Then the toilet FLUSHES. The old man peeks from stall door.

                    ELDERLY MAN
          I’m coming out now.


INT. IOWA COUNTRY CLUB - PATIO - NIGHT

Scott grabs the kids and heads for the parking lot, Austin’s
Jester hat bouncing as they go.

Joe stands in the crowd, WATCHING THROUGH THE WINDOW, sad, as
Scott leads his children to the car.

WE SEE IT PLAY OUT FROM JOE’S POV. And this time it’s not
funny at all. As Scott falls to the ground, so drunk he can‘t
stand up. As the other man hands him his keys. As Austin
giggles, clueless, and Logan cries. Scared to death.

AS THE CAR DRIVES OFF, the crowd counts down to midnight.
“Five, four, three, two, one....”

WE CUT TO BLACK:

                    CROWD (O.S.)
          Happy New Year!!!

SILENCE. For a long beat.

                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Like I said. Sometimes it’s bad
          when things break, sometimes it’s
          good. You don’t always know which
          it’s gonna be.

THEN, from the darkness -- BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT. And WATER.
Cascading down in SUPER SLO MOTION.

It’s beautiful. Cleansing. Serene. And we SMASH CUT INTO:


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - SCOTT AND TERESA BEDROOM - MORNING

A pitcher of cold water dumps on Scott.

He bolts up in bed, GASPING. Soaking wet. Still in last
night’s clothes. He looks up through swollen eyes and sees:

TERESA, standing over him. Furious.
                                                          87.


                    TERESA
          I want you out of this house. NOW!

Scott is bleary, confused. No idea what’s happening. He
squints, trying to put it together. Suddenly he jumps up -

                       SCOTT
          The kids!

He rushes to the window -- THE CAR IS ON THE LAWN. Crashed
through their fence. His brain spins. What did I do??

                    TERESA
          The kids are fine, they’re in their
          room. And they’re staying there
          until you’re gone. I don’t want you
          near them. Or me. Now get out.

                       SCOTT
          Teresa....

                       TERESA
          GET! OUT!!


EXT. RENTAL HOUSE - MORNING

Scott stumbles from the house, past his wrecked car. He
pauses to try to straighten a splintered fence post. Then
gives up and walks off down the street, alone.


EXT. SCOTT’S PARENTS' HOUSE - DAY

Scott’s Mom and Dad stand at the front door as Scott climbs
the porch, ashamed.

                    SCOTT (PRE-LAP)
          I don’t know what to do, I don’t
          know where to go...


INT. SCOTT’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - NIGHT

Scott sits across from them. Head down.

                    SCOTT’S DAD
          You stay here with us.

Scott finally glances at his mother. Knows she’s angry.

                    SCOTT
          I’m sorry, Mom.
                                                          88.


Mom picks up a plate. Here we go. But instead of smashing it,
she hands it to Scott.

                    SCOTT’S MOM
          You break it.

He hesitates, but she’s not messing around. He shrugs, throws
the plate to the floor. It BREAKS into pieces. She points.

                    SCOTT’S MOM (CONT'D)
          Is that you right now?

Scott nods, eyes filling. Then Mom wraps her arms around him.

                    SCOTT’S MOM (CONT'D)
          Moments like this are what grace is
          meant for, Scott.
              (takes his face in her hands)
          It’s not your mistakes that define
          you, it’s how you heal. How you put
          the pieces back together.
          So get to work.

She slaps his face hard. Scott flinches, Hey! Looks to Dad.

                    SCOTT’S DAD
          What she said.


INT. ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS MEETING - DAY

Scott sits in the back of an AA meeting, head low, just
listening, as they all read together.

                    EVERYONE TOGETHER
          “An honest regret for harms done, a
          genuine gratitude for blessings
          received, and a willingness to try
          for better things tomorrow...”


EXT. FIELD - SUNSET

Scott walks beside a long, frosted field. Alone.


EXT. PARK - DAY

Scott plays at the park with Austin and Logan.

                    AUSTIN
          When are you coming home?
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                   89.


                    SCOTT
          Not sure yet, Auz Man. I need some
          time to get better.

Austin doesn’t understand. But Logan does. And Scott can
barely make eye contact with him.

                    AUSTIN
          Hey, maybe you should go to the
          crazy hospital like I did.

                    SCOTT
          Maybe I should.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MORNING

Teresa sits with Austin at the table. Home schooling him.

                    TERESA
          Come on, Auz, stay focused. I’m not
          just gonna give you the answers.

Austin SIGHS, turns back to his book. OFF THIS, we hear
MACHINE GUN FIRE.

                    TERESA (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
          No way. Not ready, not even close.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Teresa and Lori play CALL OF DUTY on Xbox. Both of them          *
BLASTING ENEMY SOLDIERS as they chat.

                    TERESA
          I just keep thinking of him....
          choosing to drink, after everything
          we talked about. Choosing to get in
          that car. With our kids. You know
          what could have happened to them, I
          can’t even....
              (she shudders)
          So no. God can forgive him if he
          wants to. Not me. Not now.

                    LORI
          I hear that. I do. I’ll just say
          this, though...
                      Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)               90.


                    TERESA                                     *
          No, don’t try to talk me down, you                   *
          kidding me, after everything we                      *
          went through? Growing up with this.                  *
          I’m not doing it again....                           *

                    LORI                                       *
          That’s not what I’m saying, let me                   *
          finish.                                              *

Lori lowers her controller.                                    *

                      TERESA                                   *
          Go ahead.                                            *

                    LORI                                       *
          All I’m saying is -- You’re not                      *
          Mom, T. And Scott’s not Dad. Yeah,                   *
          he messed up, but he’s HERE. He                      *
          loves you, he loves those kids. And                  *
          you know what, I’ll bet he’s                         *
          struggling with a lot right now.                     *
          But you’ve had your share of
          struggles, too, be honest.

                      TERESA
          So?

She fires a ROCKET LAUNCHER, blows up a building. YES.

                    LORI
          So are you gonna struggle together,
          or struggle apart?

                    TERESA
          Apart. Definitely. I can’t even
          look at him, I’d tear his face off,
          I’m serious.

Lori LAUGHS.

                    LORI
          Alright then. Fair enough.


EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING

Logan rolls up to school on his new SKATEBOARD. As he kicks
up the board, it’s snatched away from behind. He turns.

                    TYLER
          Happy New Year, Tiny Tim, check out
          my sweet new board.
                                                           91.


                    LOGAN
          Why are you such a jerk, man? Give
          it back.

                    TYLER
          Nah. But you can borrow it sometime.

He starts to walk away. Logan grabs the board. Tyler spins
around, pushes Logan hard.

Logan stumbles back, then charges Tyler, pissed.

But Tyler is too big for him. He absorbs the momentum, then
punches Logan square in the face. Knocks him to the ground.

Logan isn’t done. He charges Tyler, tackling him. Then
unleashes, swinging wildly. His punches barely connect, but
it’s enough to freak Tyler out. He pushes Logan off.

                    LOGAN
          What is it with you?? You mess with my
          brother, you mess with me, WHY?? Do you
          even see yourself? You’re a cliche,
          you’re a bully, you’re nothing!

By now students have gathered. A TEACHER rushes over. She
looks to Logan, surprised.

                    TEACHER
          Logan? What is this?

                    LOGAN
          Nothing. He took my skateboard.

The teacher turns to Tyler. He shrugs, hands the board over.

                    TYLER
          Learn to take a joke, man.

He walks off, trying to be play it cool. But he’s rattled.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Teresa puts ice on Logan’s swollen eye. Austin is upset.

                    AUSTIN
          LOGAN! Why did you hit Tyler??

                    LOGAN
          He hit ME! Austin, the guy is a
          total jerk, why do you want to be
          friends with him so much?
                                                          92.


                    AUSTIN
          Because..... He’s sad.

                       LOGAN
          He’s WHAT?

                    AUSTIN
          He’s sad. His Dad’s been in jail
          for a long, long time, and also his
          Mom is sick, like really sick with
          cancer, and I heard they don’t even
          get to do Christmas. So I think
          he’s sad. I can see it when I look
          at him. And that makes me sad.

Logan frowns, struck. Then the front door opens and Scott
rushes in, already worked up. Sees Logan’s black eye.

                    SCOTT
          This was Tyler again?

                    LOGAN
          It’s fine, Dad. I’m okay.

                    SCOTT
          I’m going to school tomorrow. I’m
          gonna straighten this kid out.

Logan stops him.

                    LOGAN
          No. Dad. Let me deal with it.


INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - MORNING

Logan sits across from Teresa and the Principal, ILENE.

                    ILENE
          You sure you want to do this?

Logan nods, and ILENE opens the door. The TEACHER who broke
up the fight leads Tyler in. He sees Logan and stops.

Logan holds out a large gift, wrapped in Christmas paper.

                    TYLER
          What is this?

                    LOGAN
          It’s for you. A late Christmas
          present.

Tyler eyes him and all these adults, wary.
                                                           93.


                      TYLER
            I don’t get it.

                      ILENE
            It’s okay. Open it.

Tyler hesitates, then carefully opens the gift. It’s Logan’s
new skateboard. Tyler looks to him. WTF??

                      LOGAN
            I want you to have it.

                        TYLER
            Why?!

                      LOGAN
            I thought... maybe you didn’t have
            a great Christmas, so...

                        TYLER
            You what?

Tyler stares at him, his face unreadable. Logan fumbles.

                      LOGAN
            I don’t know, I just wanted you to
            have that. And I know that’s kind
            of weird, but -- I guess I’m kind
            of weird. Anyway...
                (totally sincere)
            I don’t want to fight with you, I’d
            rather be friends. Is that okay?

Tyler’s   face goes red. Looks like he’s going to be angry, but
instead   tears well in his eyes. Tyler lowers his head. After
a beat,   he nods. And tears fall. From Logan, too. AND FROM
TERESA,   who couldn’t be more proud of her boy.


INT. ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS MEETING - DAY

Another day, another meeting. Partway through, Scott looks up
and recognizes someone in the group. It’s Preacher Rick.

AFTERWARD, Scott approaches him.

                      SCOTT
            Rick. What are you doing here?

                      PREACHER RICK
                (matter of fact)
            I’m an alcoholic. You?
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                94.


                    SCOTT
          Yeah... uh. Same.

First time he’s actually said it. Rick pats his back.

                    PREACHER RICK
          See you next time.


INT. RENTAL HOUSE - MORNING

Logan grabs his backpack, ready for school. He looks to
Austin, sitting at the dining room table, ready for home
schooling. His lizard Marty is his only classmate. It’s sad.

Mom sees Logans’s face.

                    TERESA
          We’ll figure something out. We’ll                      *
          find him a good school, don’t worry.                   *

He nods, thinking. Then gives her a quick kiss and heads out.


INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY                             *

Logan carries his tray. He spots a group of kids huddled,        *
whispering and giggling. Hears the word “Austin”, then one of    *
the kids sees him and they all go quiet. Logan struts over.      *

                    LOGAN                                        *
          Hey, are you talking about my                          *
          brother? Do NOT make fun of him.                       *

They all turn, revealing TYLER. Logan eyes him.                  *

                    TYLER                                        *
          No man, we weren’t. For real.                          *

But they’re hiding something. Tyler gives Logan a reassuring     *
look. It’s cool, promise. Then waves the other kids off. He      *
nods for Logan to join him, offers his brownie as a peace        *
offering. Wary, Logan accepts. Then sits with Tyler for lunch.   *


INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

Scott and Teresa meet in the school’s front entrance.

                    SCOTT
          Do you know what this is about?

Teresa shakes her head. No idea. As they walk down the hall --
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                95.


                    PRINCIPAL (PRE-LAP)
          Thank you for coming in.


INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The principal ILENE sits across from them. They’re both wary.

                    PRINCIPAL
          I want to talk about Austin. I know
          you’ve withdrawn him from the
          resource class.

                    TERESA
          We’re homeschooling for now. Until
          we find something else.

Ilene nods.

                      SCOTT
          Look, we know he’s different,
          Ilene, we’re not delusional. But
          the thing that makes Austin
          different is what makes him
          “special.” And we refuse to hide
          that away. Or apologize for it.
               (firm)
          So we’ll find him another school.
          He does better when he’s around
          more “typical” kids. They’re his                      *
          friends. He learns from them. And I
          think they learn just as much from
          him.

After a beat.

                    ILENE
          I agree.
              (she opens a file)
          And you’re right about the other
          kids. They all love him.

She slides a stack of loose leaf paper across the desk. Pages
and pages of signatures.

                    ILENE (CONT'D)
          It’s a petition. Signed by just
          about every student in school.

Scott and Teresa flip through the pages, in shock.

                    ILENE (CONT'D)
          Austin inspires something in
          people.
                    (MORE)
                                                           96.

                    ILENE (CONT'D)
          I think we can all learn from him.
          I know I can.
              (she smiles)
          He’s welcome back any time.

From this -- CHEERING.


INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - DAY

A school rally. Ilene stands before the whole student body.

                    ILENE
          I have a special announcement. Back
          by popular demand.... Please give a
          big, rowdy welcome to the man
          behind the tiger. Everyone’s
          favorite mascot, Auz Man!

Austin runs out in the tiger costume and everyone FREAKS OUT.
MUSIC PLAYS and Austin does his famous Tiger dance.

Tyler and Logan run up to join him. Logan wears the Jester
hat. He yells to Tyler over the APPLAUSE.

                    LOGAN
          Hey. Thanks, man. For doing this.

Tyler grins.

                    TYLER
          Don’t know what you mean.

He snatches the Jester hat and puts it on.

FROM BESIDE THE BLEACHERS, Scott and Teresa take it all in.
Scott watches AUSTIN, dancing, laughing, happy as can be.

PUSH IN ON SCOTT’S FACE. He smiles, but something in him is
unsettled. The rhythm of the drums is slowly replaced by a
pensive CLICK, CLICK, CLICK....

                    SCOTT (PRE-LAP)
          I wish I could enjoy anything as
          much as my son enjoys everything.


INT. ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS MEETING - DAY

Scott speaks. He grips a pen, CLICKING it over and over.

                    SCOTT
          I’ve always held on so tight to
          things. I don’t even know why.
                    (MORE)
                                                           97.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          I just need everything to be a
          certain way...

Scott looks at his shoes as he talks. He taps his feet to the
CLICKS. Twice with the right, twice with the left.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          We talk about “an attitude of
          gratitude”.... That’s never been
          me. I’m never content, never have
          been. I used to think that made me
          ambitious, but really I’m just....
              (he turns inward)
          Ungrateful. I hate that about
          myself. I push everything away --
          everything and everyone I care
          about.

Scott looks up for the first time. Into the crowd of faces.
Rick is there. And then we see -- JOE.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          I don’t want to do that anymore.

Joe nods. Like he’s accepting an apology. From himself.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          I want to be more like my son.

He pauses. Taps twice with his left foot. Just once with the
right. Stops himself. Waits. Nothing. Huh.


EXT. SCOTT’S PARENTS' HOUSE - DAY

Scott returns to the house to find Teresa waiting on the
front steps. He stops, surprised. Then he waves.


INT. SCOTT’S PARENTS' HOUSE - DAY

Scott pours coffee. Hands a mug to Teresa. They’re both a
little awkward.

                    TERESA
          So. I wanted to talk about.... the
          uh -- the camping trip. Is this
          weekend.

                    SCOTT
          Right. I figured that was off. That
          I.... shouldn’t go.
                                                        98.


                    TERESA
          I think you should. Austin is so
          excited about it.

Scott shifts in place, like a child. Working up the nerve.

                    SCOTT
          T. I’m so sorry. About what I did.
          And what I didn’t do. About
          everything. There’s so much I want
          to say...

He chokes, can’t quite look at her. Still filled with shame.
Before he can say any more, Teresa takes a step toward him.

                    TERESA
          You know what I admire about you?

Tears immediately well in Scott’s eyes. He shakes his head
and turns away. He can’t accept it. But Teresa stands right
in front of him, takes his hand.

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          You’re broken. And lost, and
          scared, and getting things
          wrong.... But you keep trying.

Scott nods, barely holding it together.

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          You know how I used to wonder if I
          was the princess or the ugly
          stepsister? Turns out I’m not
          either, I’m just a regular mess.
          And I don’t expect you to be a
          perfect prince, that would be
          boring. And it would make me feel
          super insecure.
              (she looks him in the eye)
          You’re a good man, Scott, with a
          good heart. I knew it the moment I
          met you. You’ve given up a lot for
          this family, and you’ve never
          stopped fighting for us. Even now.

Scott cries openly, unable to contain it anymore.

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          Two month sober. I’m so proud of
          you.

                    SCOTT
          74 days actually. But to be fair,
          it only seems like 19 and a half.
                                                          99.


Teresa LAUGHS out loud.

                    TERESA
          So yeah, damn right I admire you.
          And by the way, I’ve been giving
          this some thought since our
          wedding. And -- I definitely do
          love you. So how about we struggle
          together?

He looks at her, relieved. You sure?

                    TERESA (CONT'D)
          I figure if Logan can forgive the
          school bully, I oughta be able to
          forgive you.

                    SCOTT
              (then, realizing)
          Awww man.

He goes to a desk in the dining room. Pulls out an 11x7
ADVERTISEMENT.

                    SCOTT (CONT'D)
          So I did all this work for nothing?

CLOSE ON THE AD: IT’S THE PHOTO BOOTH PICTURE from Scott and
Teresa’s first date at the arcade. Teresa’s head on his
shoulder. Cheery text reads:

             FORGIVENESS! Half the price of bitterness,
                  with none of the calories!

Teresa cracks up, genuinely impressed.

                    TERESA
          You made this??

                     SCOTT
          I thought I was gonna have to sell
          you on it.

                    TERESA
          This is really good, Scott! Wait,
          we don’t have to move to New York
          now, do we?

                    SCOTT
          Nah, I’m happy here.
                                                         100.


EXT. CAMPGROUND - DAY

Scott pulls his car into a campground parking lot BUZZING
with excited kids. As he and Austin unload -

                    SCOTT
          Looks like we have to hike a mile
          or so to the campsite. And the bags
          are heavy, so if you start to get
          tired, or your ankles hurt....

But Austin is already out of the car, bags on his shoulders,
huffing it right along with the other kids. Okay then.

Over this - THUNDER CRACKS.


INT. SCOTT’S TENT - NIGHT

Scott and Rick share a tent. Lightning FLASHES outside. Rain
pelts down. Water already leaks onto Scott. He’s miserable.

                    SCOTT
          I better get Austin. He doesn’t do
          well with sleepovers, even normal
          ones. With all this, he’s gonna
          have a meltdown any second.

                    PREACHER RICK
          So he melts down. It’s alright.

Scott hesitates, then lies back down. Okay, I warned you. He
pokes the tent. More water dumps on him. Great.


EXT. CAMPGROUND - MORNING

The sky is clear. BRIGHT MORNING SUN rises behind the tents.


INT. SCOTT’S TENT - MORNING

Scott bolts awake to Austin. Fired up and ready to go.

                    AUSTIN
          Dad! What’s up? What an awesome
          night. How’d you sleep? Are you
          ready to rock? What’d you do all
          night? Do you love these tents? We
          had a blast. This is going to be
          great. Are you hungry? I am. Let’s
          do it, man! By the way, Dad, was
          that storm cool or what? That was
          so awesome!
                                                         101.


And he’s out. Scott and Rick share a look. Morning.

SERIES OF EVENTS. Austin and Scott compete with the others:

- A RELAY RACE, as dads carry kids on hand-made stretchers.

- A SAWING CONTEST, where Scott and Austin race to saw
through a foot-thick log with a large two-handled saw.

Then... SWISH!

- AN ARROW STICKS INTO A TARGET. Just outside the bullseye.

WHIP PAN over as the shooter steps aside, making room for his
competitor.... AUSTIN. Up next.

Austin nocks his arrow, focused. CLOSE ON HIS EYES, he’s in
the zone. We see his POV -- The feather, the bow string, the
target. Austin breathes, and lets it fly.

BULLSEYE!

Scott blinks. What?? He can’t believe it. Everyone FREAKS
OUT. CHEERING. But Austin is already over it. No big deal.

                      AUSTIN (CONT'D)
            Let’s go, Dad. Time to move on!


EXT. LAKE - SUNSET

Scott and Austin glide across the lake in a canoe. The sun
sets over the water. It’s beautiful.

Austin is exhausted from the day. So Scott paddles. Austin
watches him. Then, out of nowhere.

                      AUSTIN
            Dad. I wish I was more like you.

This stops Scott. He looks at Austin. As hard as it is for
him to accept that right now, Austin is completely sincere.

                      SCOTT
            You do?

                      AUSTIN
            Course I do, silly goose. You’re
            the best.

AUSTIN GRINS. And his eyes twinkle in that knowing way. As
Scott meets his bright blue gaze...
                                                       102.


                    AUSTIN (V.O.)
          Most of the time, Dad can’t see
          what I see. But that day floating
          on the lake, he did.

And now WE SEE QUICK FLASHES -- MOMENTS FROM AUSTIN’S LIFE.
Some big, some small.

Scott holding baby Austin as he cries. Running him heroically
into a hospital, time after time. Hiding in the closet - “I
found you!”, Scott holding him at the swing set. Speeding
after the finance guy, wind whipping his hair. Playing games
together, watching movies, laughing, crying....

Most of them are moments Scott considered failures, or
forgettable. But through Austin’s eyes - they’re perfect.

                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
          That day he saw exactly what I see.
              (beat)
          A great dad.

BACK TO CANOE. Scott is struck. He smiles at his son through
happy tears.

FROM THIS, WE PULL OUT to reveal they’re no longer floating
on water, but in a sea of radiant, magical clouds. In
Austin’s imagination.

                    AUSTIN
          You see it, Dadio?

                    SCOTT
          Yeah, Auz Man. I sure do.

And this time, he really does.


EXT. CAMPGROUND - NIGHT

Everyone gathers around a CRACKLING FIRE. Chatting, singing,
making s’mores. The lake reflects a million stars.

Scott strums his guitar. Beside him, Austin lays his head
down, immediately asleep. Rick sits down, joining Scott.

They stare into the fire for a beat.

                     SCOTT
          You know, I didn’t want to come on
          this trip, I wanted to stay home.
              (beat)
          I almost missed all this.
                                                       103.


                    PREACHER RICK
          You made a good choice.

                    SCOTT
          Guess I owe you one. Or God. Could
          you tell Him for me?

                    PREACHER RICK
          Tell him yourself. It’s not that
          hard.


EXT. LAKE - DAWN

The sky glows blue. Everyone is asleep in their tents. Scott
sits on a rock with Joe, watching the mist over the lake.

                    SCOTT
          So.... I have a question.

                    JOE
          Yeah?

                    SCOTT
          I’ve been talking to you almost all
          my life. And it just occurred to me.
              (hesitant)
          Are you... God?

Joe nods thoughtfully, like he’s been expecting this question.

                    JOE
          Scott. Look at me. Look at my face,
          son.

Scott does, a little wary. And Joe’s face STARTS GLOWING.
Scott stares, eyes wide. The white light seems to overtake
Joe’s face until..... IT SNAPS BACK TO NORMAL.

                    JOE (CONT'D)
          No, I’m not God, dimwit.

Scott shakes his head.

                    JOE (CONT'D)
          Seriously. What did you think was
          gonna happen there?


EXT. CAMPGROUND - MORNING

The kids and dads all walk back to their cars, loaded up with
gear. The kids cluster together, chatting. Dads do the same.
                                                       104.


Then Austin runs up alongside Scott and takes his hand. They
walk together in silence for a moment. Then Austin asks -

                    AUSTIN
          Whatcha thinkin’, Dadio?

Scott shrugs.

                    SCOTT
          Nothing, really.

And as they continue together, hand in hand...

                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
          But that wasn’t true. Dad told me
          later he was thinking, “what
          teenage boy wants to hold his
          father’s hand?” And you wanna know
          what he was feeling?
              (beat)
          Grateful.

AT THE CAR, Scott loads Austin, then shuts the door. Looks
out over the horizon. Takes a breath. Then -

                    SCOTT
          Thank you. For everything.

Then, from inside the car.

                     AUSTIN (O.S.)
          Welcome!


INT. BURGER STAR - DAY

Scott, Teresa, Austin and Logan all sit together. Burgers and
fries for everyone. And for Austin, a LARGE STRAWBERRY
MILKSHAKE.

                    AUSTIN
          You guys, wait. Stop. Look at me!

They all look. Except Scott, who is trying to sneak a bite.

                    AUSTIN (CONT'D)
          Dad. Look at me, please, thank you and
          you’re welcome, this is important!

Scott can’t help but laugh. But he really wants this burger.
                                                       105.


                    AUSTIN (CONT'D)
          Put it down and -- stop what you’re
          doing and look at me, Dad. You’re
          not looking!

                    SCOTT
          Okay, I’m looking, I’m looking.
          What is so important?

Austin takes another big sip of his shake, then, blissfully:

                    AUSTIN
          This shake, oh my gosh, this is the
          best strawberry shake I’ve ever
          had! You have to believe me.

They all smile, but Austin isn’t done.

                    AUSTIN (CONT'D)
          The texture, the smoothness, it is
          so creamy and, oh man, it’s just
          like heaven. I know milkshakes are
          great, but this one is perfection.
          Do you get it?! The shake makes the
          deal. It makes everything better,
          everything!

Then he screams it out.

                    AUSTIN (CONT'D)
          This is the best day of my life!

The whole restaurant turns. But Austin is done now. Back to
his shake. Scott and family just smile.

As Scott finally takes his bite, we PUSH IN ON HIM, and now
IT’S HIS VOICE THAT COMES IN.

                    SCOTT (V.O.)
          I believe Austin, that it really
          was the best milkshake ever.
          Because to Austin, every milkshake
          can be the best milkshake. Every
          day can be the best day. Every
          moment, the best moment. You just
          have to be able to see it.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Scott drives his family home. He looks to the back seat,
where Austin sits with his face out the window, Jester hat
flapping in the wind, sun on his face. Happy as can be.
                                                       106.


                    SCOTT (V.O.)
          Until that day, I spent most of my
          son’s life trying to figure him
          out. So I could fix him. But it
          turns out he wasn’t broken at all.
          He didn’t need me to fix him. I
          needed him to fix me. That’s a true
          fact.

Scott adjusts the rearview, SO HE CAN SEE HIS WHOLE FAMILY AS
HE DRIVES. Teresa in the passenger seat. Austin and Logan in
the back. And between then, Joe. Scott smiles.

                     SCOTT (V.O.)
          Look. See this moment. Right here?
              (beat)
          Best moment of my life.
