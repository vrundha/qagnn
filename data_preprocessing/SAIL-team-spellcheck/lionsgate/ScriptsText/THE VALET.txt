EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

A handsome man, ANTONIO FLORES (late 40s, kind eyes,
questionable mustache), cruises down Canon in a Maserati
convertible. He stops at a light next to a Lamborghini whose
DRIVER gives Antonio a “rich guy” nod.

                    DRIVER
          How do you like the GT?

                    ANTONIO
          Honestly, I prefer the Q4. Better
          turning radius.

The light changes and Antonio zips off, pulling in front of
KOBRA -- a high-end restaurant.

He hops out and holds the door for the real OWNER of the car.
Antonio is the VALET.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          Have a nice day, sir.

Antonio hustles back to the other VALETS. BENNY (40, owner of
the parking concession) grabs KEYS off the board. NOTE:
Dialogue in italics will be spoken in Spanish.

                    BENNY
          Antonio, look alive.

He tosses the keys to Antonio who hightails it down the
sidewalk. As he weaves through well-dressed shoppers, Antonio
runs past a SALON where several PAPARAZZI wait outside.


INT. HIGH-END SALON - CONTINUOUS

OLIVIA ALLAN (30s, famous actress, two SAG Awards, one Golden
Globe) has her hair done by the best in the biz. Olivia’s
assistant, AMANDA (25, shoulda gone to law school) steps up.

                    AMANDA
          Sorry, Olivia -- someone tipped off
          the paparazzi.

                    OLIVIA
          They’re relentless.

                    AMANDA
          Want me to pull the car into the
          back alley?

Olivia considers this as she checks herself in the mirror.
It’s a really good hair day.
                                                2.


EXT. HIGH-END SALON - MOMENTS LATER

Olivia emerges out the front, “shocked” to see paparazzi
snapping pictures and taking video.

                    OLIVIA
          You guys, you’re like flies on sh--
              (catches herself)
          Like bees on honey.

                    PAPARAZZI
          Olivia!/You dating anyone?/Over
          here!/Olivia!

Olivia waves as she hops into her waiting Range Rover.


EXT. STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - DAY

A BILLBOARD for Olivia’s upcoming film, “EARHART” -- Olivia
stands front and center, dressed as the famous pilot, her
eyes filled with determination and mischief.

PAN DOWN to find Antonio, riding his bicycle home from work.

CREDITS ROLL as Antonio pedals across town. Starting in
Beverly Hills, things become increasingly less affluent as he
makes his way East.


INT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

Olivia rides a Peloton Bike in her mid-century modern in the
Hollywood Hills with killer views of the city.


EXT. STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - DAY

Antonio cruises into PICO-UNION, a mostly Hispanic
neighborhood on the edge of Koreatown. CREDITS END as he
rides by a construction site plastered with posters for
Olivia’s film, its title now in Spanish: “LA AVIADORA.”


EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

A PUBLIC SCHOOL in the shadow of downtown. Antonio waits with
his bike as THEATER KIDS straggle out.

MARCO (15, gangly handsome, Antonio’s son) heads over as a
CUTE GIRL crosses by with her friends.
                                                  3.


                    SOFIA
          See you, Marco. Promise I’ll know
          my lines by tomorrow.

                    MARCO
          Bye, Sofia.

Marco and Antonio start walking down the sidewalk.

                    MARCO (CONT'D)
          Don’t say anything.

                    ANTONIO
          I didn’t say anything.

                    MARCO
          You’re smiling.

                    ANTONIO
          I’m allowed to smile.

                    MARCO
          She’s in the play with me. That’s it.

                    ANTONIO
          Okay.
              (then, fishing)
          So how’s your mom doing?

                    MARCO
          You said you weren’t gonna put me
          in the middle.

                    ANTONIO
          You’re right, you’re right.

They walk down Alvarado in silence, then:

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          Sofia’s pretty cute.

                      MARCO
          I’m done.

Antonio smiles as Marco puts in EARBUDS.


EXT. BRENTWOOD MANSION - SAME TIME

A sprawling SPANISH COLONIAL estate with a few Mexican
GARDENERS tending to the grounds.
                                                4.


                    KATHRYN (O.S.)
          I need the tablecloths ironed --
          I’m hosting a brunch for the board
          of the Red Cross...


INT. BRENTWOOD MANSION, FOYER - CONTINUOUS

KATHRYN ROYCE (mid-40s, confident, polished) walks down the
stairs dictating into a MINI DIGITAL RECORDER.

                    KATHRYN
          Oh, and get cherries. I read an
          article -- they’re very rich in
          antioxidants.

She reaches the foyer as her housekeeper, BLANCA (38,
Guatemalan immigrant), crosses with a basket of laundry.

                    KATHRYN (CONT'D)
          Perfect timing, Blanca. Just a few
          things. Should I put it right here?

                    BLANCA
          That would be helpful, Mrs. Royce.

Kathryn places the recorder on the clothes. As Blanca walks
off, GEORGE ROYCE (mid-40s, boyishly handsome, roguishly
charming), sneaks up and kisses his wife on the neck.

                    GEORGE
          I have to work tonight. Emergency
          pow-wow with Councilman Ramirez on
          the Pico-Union Project.

                    KATHRYN
          You can’t tell me that while you’re
          kissing my neck.

                    GEORGE
          I don’t know why the community’s
          fighting us so hard on this one.
          It’s really dampening my
          enthusiasm. How was your day?

                    KATHRYN
          Strategic planning meeting at the
          museum. Two hours about parking.
          Two more about whether the new logo
          looks like a vagina. It does. And
          not a particularly inviting one.
              (off his laugh)
          Why don’t we just quit everything
          and move to Paris.
                                                5.


                    GEORGE
          You’d get sick of me.

                    KATHRYN
          But we’d be in Paris.


EXT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

Ten units, built in the 50s. Antonio lugs his bike upstairs.
Marco follows with groceries as a Korean man, MR. KIM (75,
elegant, little English), steps out of Antonio’s apartment
with plumbing tools.

                    ANTONIO
          Mr. Kim? Everything okay?

                    MR. KIM
          Toilet. Flush good.

Mr. Kim hurries off. Antonio locks his bike to the balcony
and they head inside to find...


INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

...Antonio’s Mom, CECILIA (mid-70s, full of life), in a
bathrobe, fixing a snack. Marco hugs his grandmother.

                    ANTONIO
          Mom, are you putting something down
          the toilet? The landlord’s been
          here like three times this week.

                    CECILIA
          It’s an old building.

                    ANTONIO
          He needs to get a real handyman.
          I’m gonna talk to him.

Antonio heads for the door.

                    CECILIA
          No. Listen, mijo, you’ll find out
          eventually -- Mr. Kim and I are
          lovers.

                    ANTONIO
          What?

                    CECILIA
          We’re very happy.
                                                6.


                    ANTONIO
          Mr. Kim? You don’t know Korean. He
          doesn’t know Spanish. Between you,
          you have like ten words in English.

                    CECILIA
          We speak a deeper language.

Antonio cringes as he tries to make sense of it all:

                    ANTONIO
          So the freezer wasn’t broken?

She shakes her head “no.”

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          And the garbage disposal?

She shakes her head “no” again.


EXT. DOWNTOWN - LATER THAT EVENING

Olivia drives her RANGE ROVER down Figueroa, turning left
into a PARKING STRUCTURE.


EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE, TOP LEVEL - MOMENTS LATER

The SUV drives up the ramp and parks next to the only other
car, a black JAGUAR SEDAN with tinted windows.

Olivia, hiding under a hoodie and sunglasses, gets out. She
looks around, making sure she hasn’t been followed, then
climbs into the back of the Jaguar.


EXT. GRAND STREET - LATER

The Jaguar drives past a luxury hotel, turns into the alley
behind it, then down a ramp into the garage...


INT. HOTEL, BASEMENT GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

...and parks next to the loading dock. Olivia steps out and
hurries to the SERVICE ELEVATOR.

She closes the metal gate and disappears into the building.


INT. HOTEL, PENTHOUSE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Olivia knocks on the door of the PRESIDENTIAL SUITE.
                                                 7.


After a beat, GEORGE opens it.

                    GEORGE
          God, I’ve missed that hoodie.

She hurries in, quickly closes the door behind her...

                    OLIVIA
          I hate how much this turns me on.

...and kisses him.


INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - LATER

Antonio cooks dinner with his sister CLARA (35, elementary
school principal, less nurturing then you’d expect).

On the couch, Marco does homework. His cousins, DANTE and
LUCA (9, twins, both evil), watch videos on an old iPad.

                    CLARA
          So I was talking to one of the
          teachers at school, she’s going
          through a divorce too, and--

                    ANTONIO
          We’re not divorced. We’re separated.

Benny (Clara’s husband, Antonio’s boss) walks in from down
the hall.

                    BENNY
          You need a candle in your bathroom.
          Or a least some kind of spray.

                    CLARA
          Tell my stupid brother how pretty
          the new music teacher is.

                    BENNY
          She’s fine. She’s okay. She’s about
          what you could probably get.

                    CLARA
          You don’t think she’s pretty?

                    BENNY
          No, I don’t. Know who’s pretty? The
          gym lady. With that whistle.

                    DANTE
          I’d hit that.
                                                8.


                    CLARA
          Dante! Where you getting this? No
          more videos. I mean it, Monstro!

The boys IGNORE HER and keep watching as Cecilia enters.

                    CLARA (CONT'D)
          Mom, are you really dating Mr. Kim?

                    CECILIA
          You gonna be judgmental?

                    BENNY
          I can answer that.

There’s a KNOCK on the door. Antonio opens it to find his ex,
ISABEL (42, pretty even in a Gelson’s cashier smock).

                    ISABEL
          Sorry I’m early. We were over-
          staffed today.

                    ANTONIO
          Come in. Stay for dinner.

                    CLARA
          We’re making asada.

                    ISABEL
          I should get going. Marco, get your
          stuff, honey.

                    ANTONIO
          You alright? You seem upset--

                    ISABEL
          I’m fine. I just got some bad news.

Antonio leads her OUTSIDE to the...


EXT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

...balcony walkway, closing the door behind them -- for
privacy, even though the courtyard is filled with neighbors.

                    ISABEL
          The bank denied my loan. I have to
          take the year off from school.

                    ANTONIO
          Why?
                                                 9.


                    ISABEL
          My car broke down, I fell behind on
          some payments and ugh -- two
          semesters, that’s all I have left.

                    ANTONIO
          How much do you need? I have a
          little savings.

                    ISABEL
          $12,850. You got that laying around?

                    ANTONIO
          I can take a second job. We can
          figure this out.

                    ISABEL
          It’s not your problem.

                    ANTONIO
          I want it to be my problem. You’ve
          worked so hard. You’re gonna be a
          great physical therapist.

She takes a breath, then:

                    ISABEL
          Listen, there’s no easy way to say
          this... I started seeing someone.

                     ANTONIO
              (gut-punched)
          What? Who?

                    ISABEL
          His name’s Randy. He’s a realtor.

                    ANTONIO
          “Randy the Realtor?” The guy from
          the bus benches? This guy?

Antonio strikes a “cool guy” pose, FINGER GUNS a-blazing.

                    ISABEL
          He’s nice to me.

                    ANTONIO
          I’m not nice to you?

                    ISABEL
          Let’s not fight, Antonio. People
          change.
                                                 10.


                       ANTONIO
          I haven’t.

                       ISABEL
          I know.

Marco steps out with his backpack and a small suitcase.

                    MARCO
          Abuelita ran out of medicine. Tia
          says if she has another heart attack
          you’ll have to answer to the Virgin
          Mary. She only gets religious when
          she’s really mad. Just wanted you to
          know what you’re walking into, Dad.

Still reeling, Antonio watches his wife and son walk away.


INT. HOTEL, PENTHOUSE SUITE - LATER

Olivia and George, post-sex, cuddle in bed.

                    GEORGE
          That was life changing.

                    OLIVIA
          I’ve been doing a lot of pilates.

As she snuggles into him, George phone BUZZES on the beside
table. He glances at the text.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Who’s that? Is that Kathryn?

                    GEORGE
          Doesn’t matter. We have two more
          uninterrupted hours. We can shut
          the world out.

He puts the phone down and kisses her. His phone buzzes
again. They try to ignore it, but:

                    OLIVIA
          I don’t think I can do this anymore.

                    GEORGE
          I didn’t even look that time.

                    OLIVIA
          I need to go.
                                                 11.


                    GEORGE
          Come on. Stay. I’ll order another
          bottle.

She gets up and starts putting on her clothes.

                    OLIVIA
          You know the only person I’ve told
          about us? My assistant. I’m too
          embarrassed to tell anyone else.

                    GEORGE
          How do you think I feel? I’m madly
          in love with the most incredible
          woman in the world and I want to
          scream it from the rooftop.

                    OLIVIA
          I can’t believe I’m in this
          situation. I’m a role model --
          young girls look up to me. I just
          started a company dedicated to
          telling women’s stories. You’re the
          one who encouraged me to do it. You
          gave me the confidence.

                    GEORGE
          I didn’t know it was gonna bite me
          in the ass.

                    OLIVIA
          How can I explain this? Sneaking
          around with someone else’s husband,
          using code names and having
          clandestine meetings like some sort
          of slutty spy?

                    GEORGE
          You could tell them that maybe...
          you love me?

                    OLIVIA
          I do love you, George, but--

                    GEORGE
          I’m gonna leave her. I swear.
          Events conspired against us, you
          know that. I was on my way to tell
          her -- speech and everything --
          when her mom died.

                    OLIVIA
          And then she got depressed.
                                                12.


                    GEORGE
          I’m just waiting for her to get her
          sea legs back.

                     OLIVIA
          Do you realize it’s been a year?
          Literally. We met exactly one year
          ago today.

                    GEORGE
          I do know. It’s our anniversary.
          I have presents.

He opens the bedside table and hands her a wrapped book.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I got you a few sparkly things too,
          but this is what I’m most proud of.

Reluctantly, she opens it. It’s a classic memoir.

                    OLIVIA
          Bette Davis?

                    GEORGE
          First edition. Signed. 1938.

                    OLIVIA
          How’d you know she was my favorite?

                    GEORGE
          I did a little research.

                    OLIVIA
          It’s perfect.

So perfect it makes her sad. She kisses him sweetly.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Goodbye, George.

She grabs her bag and starts out...

                    GEORGE
          Olivia, wait. I’m in a loveless
          marriage. The only time I feel
          alive is when--

...CLOSING the door behind her. He jumps out of bed,
stumbling as he tries to put on his pants.
                                                13.


EXT. ROYCE HOTEL - SAME TIME

Several PAPARAZZI wait for celebrities at this LA hot spot.

                    PAPARAZZI #1
          I don’t get it. This place was on
          fire last night.

                    PAPARAZZI #2
          Rocky says the Chateau’s dead, too.
          I’m calling it.

They pack up their gear.


EXT. DOWNTOWN CVS DRUG STORE - SAME TIME

Antonio walks out with a PHARMACY BAG.


INT. HOTEL, PENTHOUSE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Olivia waits for the elevator, ordering an Uber. George
bursts out of his penthouse and runs down the empty hallway.

                    GEORGE
          I just need a little more--

DING! Olivia gets on the elevator. George arrives just as the
doors close. Dammit! He frantically pushes the call button.


EXT. DOWNTOWN - MOMENTS LATER

Antonio rides his bike, the CVS BAG slung over the handlebar.


INT. HOTEL, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

Olivia steps out of the elevator. Hotel staff and guests BUZZ
WITH EXCITEMENT as she hightails it across the lobby.

The other elevator opens. George speed-walks to catch up with
her, WHISPER-YELLING:

                    GEORGE
          You can’t go out the front.

                    OLIVIA
          I can if you don’t follow me.
                                                 14.


EXT. HOTEL, ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Olivia rushes out, the name of the hotel illuminated above
her in giant letters: ROYCE. She searches for her Uber.
George keeps pace, nervously looking around.

                    GEORGE
          You’re being reckless.

                    OLIVIA
          You’re being reckless.

A SILVER MAZDA pulls up. The UBER DRIVER lowers the window.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Dave?

                    UBER DRIVER
          Billie Jean King?


EXT. DOWNTOWN - CONTINUOUS

Antonio pedals along when something catches his eye --

A BUS BENCH AD for “Randy the Realtor,” bright white teeth,
finger guns a-blazing.

Antonio stares at it with disgust, until --

BAM! He plows into the back of OLIVIA’S UBER, throwing him
off his bike onto the street.

Olivia runs over to help Antonio.

                    OLIVIA
          Oh, my God -- are you okay?

                    ANTONIO
          Yes. Just embarrassed. Never thought
          I’d get hit by a parked car.

Pedestrians stop to watch.

                    GEORGE
          He’s fine. Everyone’s looking.

DAVE the Uber driver (32, drummer) rushes out.

                     UBER DRIVER
          Dude! What the hell?! This is my
          mom’s car!
                                                  15.


                    ANTONIO
          I’m sorry. I’ll pay for any damage.

George shoves a WAD OF CASH in the driver’s hand.

                    GEORGE
          No damage! Not a scratch! Five stars!

The driver checks the bumper, pockets the money, and gets
back in the car.

ACROSS THE WAY, one of the paparazzi steps out of a FROZEN
YOGURT SHOP. He sees Olivia with George, ducks behind a tree
and starts taking PHOTOS -- they have no idea.

As Antonio picks up his CVS BAG, George pleads with Olivia:

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Can we please go back inside?

                    OLIVIA
          What’s wrong with you? This poor
          man needs our help.

                    ANTONIO
          I’m okay. You don’t need to worry
          about me.

Antonio starts gathering his mangled bike.

                    GEORGE
          See? All good! Now let’s go upstairs.

                    OLIVIA
              (to Antonio)
          Are you sure?

                    ANTONIO
          Yes. Yes. I’m just gonna go home.

As Olivia hops in the Uber, she turns to George:

                    OLIVIA
          Call me when you’re divorced.

She slams the door. Antonio takes one last look at her as
they drive away. Is that Olivia Allan?


EXT. PICO-UNION - THE NEXT MORNING

A tree-lined boulevard. Not fancy but full of life -- small
businesses, colorful murals, people hanging out. Antonio
drags his broken bike down the block.
                                                16.


                    WOMAN (O.S.)
          I’ll throw in a new reflector...


INT. CITY BIKES - CONTINUOUS

A funky shop serving the community -- used and new bikes,
on-site repairs, local Latinx music on the sound system.

The owner, an attractive gear-head, NATALIE (40, good
tattoos, Salvadoran-American) playfully gives Antonio shit as
she puts a new wheel on his bike.

                    NATALIE
          You’re clearly a safety risk. And
          I’ll give you a horn too, so people
          hear you coming.

She calls to LU, a female bike mechanic (20s, butch).

                    NATALIE (CONT'D)
          Where container of honks?

                    LU
          Under the counter.

As she grabs one, Antonio teases her:

                    ANTONIO
          Your Spanish is terrible.

                    NATALIE
          It’s as good as your English.

                    ANTONIO
          That’s not even close to true.

                    NATALIE
          Okay, my Spanish sucks. It’s a
          source of shame.

                     LU
          She’s taking night classes. It’s
          very cute.

                    ANTONIO
              (slowly and clearly)
          Hola, Natalie. Me llamo Antonio.

                    NATALIE
          You’re both jerks. I’m taking back
          the horn.

Antonio laughs.
                                                 17.


                    NATALIE (CONT'D)
          Hey, you hear they’re trying to
          kick us out? Some asshole developer
          bought the whole block.

                    ANTONIO
          No, that’s awful.

                    NATALIE
          Fifteen years and now I’m getting
          priced out. All of us. I hope you
          like juice bars and spin classes.

                    ANTONIO
          They’re gonna replace your bike shop
          with bikes that don’t go anywhere?

She hands him a FLYER.

                    NATALIE
          There’s a City Council meeting next
          week -- we need to pack the place.


INT. OLIVIA'S PRODUCTION COMPANY - SAME TIME

A small, but cool CULVER CITY INDUSTRIAL SPACE. Olivia talks
with Amanda in her office which overlooks a bullpen where a
few young, hopeful women work at laptops.

                    OLIVIA
          You know how hard it is to find
          someone who’s successful in their
          own right so they’re not
          intimidated by my success? Who’s
          fun and sexy as hell and buys me
          books and is not an actor because
          they’re too much work?

                    AMANDA
          I don’t feel qualified to offer an
          opinion -- in terms of life
          experience, or job title or really--

                    OLIVIA
          I mean, I’m too much work -- I know
          that. Maybe I drew too hard a line.

                    AMANDA
          Isn’t there someone else you can
          talk to who might you know better?
          Like Jennifer Aniston? Aren’t you
          guys like best friends?
                                                18.


                    OLIVIA
          We did a movie together. We played
          best friends -- we didn’t even
          really like each other.

                    AMANDA
          What about your mom? She called
          again last week.

                    OLIVIA
          You talk about real stuff with your
          mom?

                       AMANDA
          You don’t?

                    OLIVIA
          My mom was a drunk and embezzled
          from me. I testified against her in
          court. She went to jail. Have you
          not Googled me?

                    AMANDA
          I will now.

                    OLIVIA
          You should read the Vanity Fair
          article. It’s actually pretty good.
          I mean, depressing. But hopeful.
          Ultimately. I think.

Olivia searches for the article on her computer...

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Just so you know, the “source close
          to the family” is me.
              (then, noticing)
          Oh, no!

Amanda looks over Olivia’s shoulder. On the TMZ WEBSITE --
the PAPARAZZI PHOTO of George and Olivia with Antonio (his
face blurred out) next to her. The headline: “George and
Olivia: Secret Romance?”

                       OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          No no no!


INT. BRENTWOOD MANSION - SAME TIME

At the breakfast table, Kathryn shows George the TMZ PHOTO.
                                               19.


                     GEORGE
          This is bullshit. I’ve never met
          the woman.

                    KATHRYN
          Then how do you explain this?

                    GEORGE
          I have no idea. I walked the
          Councilman to his car and, sure, I
          noticed her, but there were a lot
          of celebrities last night --
          including a few Lakers so I was
          more excited about that.

                    KATHRYN
          It says you were having a “lover’s
          spat.”

                    GEORGE
          I didn’t say a word to her.

On the ropes, he thinks quick and points to the photo:

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          She was with this guy.

                    KATHRYN
          The guy with the blurred-out face?

                    GEORGE
          Yes. They’re the couple. They were
          the ones bickering.

                    KATHRYN
          Do you think I’m stupid?

                    GEORGE
          Honey, you know the press -- they
          always get it wrong.

                    KATHRYN
          I want to believe you.

                    GEORGE
          You can believe me. I know I’ve
          made mistakes in the past, but I’d
          never do anything to hurt our
          marriage again. I love you. I’m
          happy. We’ll talk more about this
          tonight, but right now I have
          twenty pissed-off civil servants
          waiting for me downtown.
                                                20.


As he heads out:

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I’m calling my lawyer from the car.
          They owe us an apology!


INT. OLIVIA'S PRODUCTION COMPANY, OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER

Amanda’s on the phone as Olivia paces, upset.

                    OLIVIA
          “Earhart” opens in five days. I
          can’t have this getting out there.

                    AMANDA
              (cups phone)
          Jessica’s on a party plane to
          London for her nephew’s bar
          mitzvah.

                    OLIVIA
          They’re having destination bar
          mitzvah’s now?! Shit, tell her to
          call me the second she lands! I
          need my publicist! And an Ativan!

                    AMANDA
              (into phone)
          You heard that, right?
              (whispering)
          She’s freaking out.

                    OLIVIA
          Yes, I’m freaking out!

Olivia heads to her bathroom. Amanda hangs up and follows.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          This is the first movie under my
          own banner. It took me twelve years
          to get it made. This is my dream.
          I’m finally calling the shots.


INT. OLIVIA'S PRODUCTION OFFICE, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS (D2)

They enter.

                    OLIVIA
          Women like me. They identify with
          me. They want to think I could be
          their friend. Not that I’m gonna
          fuck their husbands.
                                                 21.


Olivia opens the medicine cabinet.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          These are very judgmental times!
          You can’t just be a good actress,
          you have to be a good person too.
          I’m not that good of a person. Half
          the people I follow on Instagram
          it’s only because I hate them.
              (re: pills)
          Where the hell are they?

                    AMANDA
          Bottom left. Next to the Xanax.

She grabs it, and they head out.


INT. OLIVIA’S PRODUCTION COMPANY, OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

They walk back in.

                    OLIVIA
          I have three studios circling this
          company waiting to see how the box
          office does. If this movie tanks...
              (indicating the office)
          ...all this will go bye-bye. The
          flowers. The Smart Water. The
          hopeful young women. The young
          women’s hopes. Everything!
              (re: bottle)
          Ahhh! I can’t open this.

She throws the bottle against the glass. The hopeful young
women look over, concerned. Olivia gives a cheery thumbs-up.


EXT. ROYCE TOWER - LATER

A sleek downtown skyscraper, emblazoned with a familiar name:
“ROYCE.” He puts it on everything.

                    GEORGE
          I was blindsided!


INT. ROYCE TOWER, GEORGE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The CORNER SUITE with a view of the city.

                    GEORGE
          I panicked! I’m not sure Kathryn
          believed me!
                                                22.


George paces, venting to his lawyer, DANIEL (45, Ivy League).

                    DANIEL
          Let me help you out -- she did not.

                    GEORGE
          She’s gonna divorce me! I’ll lose
          the company. If I humiliate her
          with a big public scandal, she and
          her father will squeeze me out.
          There’s gotta be some way to fix
          this.

                    DANIEL
          We could create a time machine and
          have you make better choices.

                    GEORGE
          I’d start by hiring a less
          sanctimonious lawyer.

Daniel considers the situation in earnest:

                    DANIEL
          Okay, look, if I had a few weeks,
          maybe I could buy up enough shares
          through a dummy company to protect
          your position.

                    GEORGE
          I don’t have a few weeks.

                    DANIEL
          Maybe you do. What if, and I’m just
          formulating this, we find the guy
          in the photo and get him and Olivia
          to pretend to be a couple.

                    GEORGE
          However much I’m paying you, it’s
          too much.

                    DANIEL
          Think about it. All they’d have to
          do is be seen in public a few
          times, get some pictures in the
          tabloids -- and just like that, a
          lie becomes the truth.


EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - THE NEXT DAY

Antonio drives a Porsche down Canon, not a care in the world.
                                                 23.


EXT. KOBRA, VALET STAND - SAME TIME

Benny, Javier and Rudy chat by the VALET STAND. Nearby, a
slick BOND TRADER waits for his car, on his cell:

                    BOND TRADER
          Which Panties? The Vegas panties?

                    JAVIER
          You listening to this douchebag?
          Does he not see us standing here?
          It’s like we’re invisible.

                    BOND TRADER
          Okay, that’s it -- I’m canceling my
          two o’clock. Handcuff yourself to
          the outdoor shower.

                    BENNY
          Tried talking to my wife like that
          once. Did not go well.


INT. PORSCHE - CONTINUOUS

As Antonio gets near the restaurant, the BLUETOOTH kicks in:

                    BOND TRADER’S GIRLFRIEND (ON SPEAKER)
          Tell me how bad you want it. Come
          on, Gordon, beg for it.

                    ANTONIO
          Ma’am--

                    BOND TRADER’S GIRLFRIEND (ON SPEAKER)
          Yes, call me ma’am -- that’s so hot.

                    ANTONIO
          You don’t understand, I’m the valet.

                    BOND TRADER’S GIRLFRIEND (ON SPEAKER)
          Oooh, the valet. And I’m a horny,
          rich bitch. What’re you gonna do to
          me?

                    ANTONIO
          Just one minute, please.

Antonio pulls in front of the restaurant...


EXT. KOBRA - CONTINUOUS

...hops out, holding the door for the Bond Trader.
                                               24.


                    ANTONIO
          Enjoy your afternoon, sir.

As the Bond Trader drives off, Antonio sees another car pull
up. George’s lawyer, Daniel, steps out. Antonio gives him a
ticket, and climbs in.


INT. MERCEDES - CONTINUOUS

As he adjusts the seat, Daniel gets in the passenger side.

                    ANTONIO
          Did you forget something?

                    DANIEL
          You’re Antonio Flores, right?

                     ANTONIO
          Yes.

                    DANIEL
          Is there some place we can talk?


EXT. PARKING LOT / INT. MERCEDES - A LITTLE LATER

Antonio and Daniel sit in the parked car, mid-conversation.

                    ANTONIO
          Olivia Allan is gonna go out with
          me?

                    DANIEL
          That’s right.

                    ANTONIO
          The famous and beautiful actress,
          Olivia Allan?

                    DANIEL
          Yes. You’ll go on a few dates.

                    ANTONIO
          Me? Go on dates with Olivia Allan?

                     DANIEL
          Correct.

                    ANTONIO
          How much do I have to pay?

                    DANIEL
          No, we pay you.
                                                25.


                    ANTONIO
          Did Benny put you up to this? You
          one of his friends from the cigar
          store?
              (starts laughing)
          Very good. You had me going.

                    DANIEL
          Mr. Flores, we desperately need
          your help. You can name your price.
          I work for a billionaire.


INT. GEORGE'S OFFICE - LATER

George and Daniel.

                     GEORGE
          $12,850?

                    DANIEL
          The exactness of the sum surprised
          me too. $12,850, not a penny more,
          not a penny less. Now it’s your
          turn.

                    GEORGE
          Olivia’s not gonna be so easy.
          Never have an affair with a woman
          who doesn’t need your money.


EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE, TOP FLOOR - LATER

A DRIVER stands, smoking, ten yards from the BLACK JAGUAR and
Olivia’s RANGE ROVER.

                    GEORGE
          Two weeks is all I’m asking...


INT. JAGUAR - CONTINUOUS

In the backseat, George makes his case to Olivia.

                    GEORGE
          Then we can finally be together.

                    OLIVIA
          I’ll do it.

                    GEORGE
          Really? You will?
                                                26.


                    OLIVIA
          It’s a big story. If they buy it,
          it’ll bury any press about us.

                    GEORGE
          I knew you loved me. I knew you’d
          do this for me.

                     OLIVIA
          I’m not doing it for you, George.
          I’m doing it for Amelia Earhart.
              (then)
          Now tell me about this guy in the
          photo.


INT. RANCHO PARK DRIVING RANGE - LATER

As a mixture of unemployed actors and old people hit golf
balls, Kathryn confers on a bench with a detective, STEGMAN
(40s, gruff, Members Only jacket). He hands her a file.

                    STEGMAN
          Antonio Miguel Flores. Forty-seven.
          Lives with his mom. Three hundred
          and twenty dollars in the bank, yet
          has an excellent credit rating. A
          rare combination. The guy’s squeaky
          clean.

                    KATHRYN
          No way she’s dating a valet.

                    STEGMAN
          I’ve been in this game a long time.
          Seen weirder couples. Much weirder.


INT. OLIVA’S CAR / EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - THE NEXT DAY

Olivia drives down Doheny. Her phone rings. She answers:

                    OLIVIA
          Yes?


INT. ROYCE TOWER, GEORGE’S OFFICE - INTERCUT

Daniel and George huddle over the speaker-phone.

                    DANIEL
          Look in your rearview mirror.
          There’s a green Yaris.
                                                 27.


IN THE MIRROR, Stegman keeps a respectable distance.

                    OLIVIA
          I’m being followed?

                    GEORGE
          Love you, babe.

                    DANIEL
          That’s Stegman. Ex LAPD. Works for
          Mrs. Royce.

                    OLIVIA
          How do you know?

                    DANIEL
          We have eyes on their eyes. The
          portly gentleman in the Subaru two
          cars back is Perez. He works for
          us.

REVEAL PEREZ (40s, enjoys food) eating string cheese as he
tails Stegman.

                    DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Your every move is being watched.


EXT. KOBRA, VALET STAND - LATER

At the VALET STAND, Benny talks with Antonio.

                    BENNY
          Your sister really wants you to give
          that music teacher a shot. Maybe I
          was too hard on her. This is from
          their retreat in Lake Arrowhead...
              (shows picture on his phone)
          A little pear-shaped, but she has a
          nice smile, right?

Javier and Rudy hang car keys on the board.

                    ANTONIO
          I told you, I don’t wanna be set up.

                    RUDY
          Know who you should go out with?
          That honey at the bike shop. She’s
          got that sweet face, and she can fix
          shit -- nothing hotter than that.

                    JAVIER
          Whoa, whoa -- way out of his league.
                                                 28.


                    BENNY
          Yeah, don’t get his expectations out
          of whack.

                    RUDY
          What’re you talking about? This is a
          nice looking man.

                    BENNY
          Charitably a five.

                    JAVIER
          And God knows his job ain’t opening
          any legs.

Olivia’s Range Rover pulls up to the curb. Rudy opens the
door. She steps out, a VISION OF HOTNESS.

                    OLIVIA
          I’ll only be a second.

Heads turn as this sexy, famous actress strides over...

                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Hi, babe.

...and KISSES Antonio -- a real big-screen kiss.

No one can believe it -- not the CUSTOMERS on the patio, not
the WAIT STAFF, not the DETECTIVES snapping photos, not even
ANTONIO, and especially not the other VALETS.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
              (to Benny)
          Are you his boss? Is it okay if I
          steal Antonio away for lunch?

                    BENNY
              (nodding his head “yes”)
          Buh. Yuh. Uh. Yuh. Lunch.

                    OLIVIA
          Thanks, you’re a sweetheart.

Antonio and Olivia stroll back to her car. Benny follows.

                    BENNY
          What’s?... What’s?... What’s
          happening here?

Antonio doesn’t know what to say. Olivia jumps in:

                    OLIVIA
          It’s new. We don’t want to label it.
                                                  29.


Antonio and Olivia drive off, leaving the valets slack-jawed.

                                                    CUT TO:

EXT. ROBERTSON BOULEVARD - LATER

With the HOLLYWOOD HILLS behind them, the Range Rover cruises
past art galleries and pricey boutiques.


INT. OLIVA’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Olivia drives. Antonio sits in the passenger seat, nervous --
not sure where to look or how to behave.

                    ANTONIO
          You keep your car very clean.

                    OLIVIA
          Look, I’m embarrassed you got roped
          into this -- you don’t need to make
          small talk if you don’t want to.

Olivia pulls up to a light and grabs her phone.

                    ANTONIO
          It’s just -- you can tell a lot
          about a person by they way they
          treat their car.

Olivia writes a text, not really listening.

                    OLIVIA
          My assistant takes care of it.

                    ANTONIO
          They do a good job. The floor mats
          are like new.

Antonio looks out the window and notices a streetlight BANNER
FOR LACMA -- is that supposed to be a vagina?

                    OLIVIA
          Okay, we’re all set -- my publicist
          tipped off the paparazzi.

                    ANTONIO
          There’s gonna be paparazzi?

                    OLIVIA
          That’s kind of the point.

The light changes and they drive off.
                                                30.


                    ANTONIO
          I’m getting nervous. My palms are
          sweaty. Do you have Kleenex?

                    OLIVIA
          Relax. They’re just going to take a
          few pictures.

                    ANTONIO
          I don’t even like being in family
          photos.

                    OLIVIA
          You just have to walk into the Ivy
          and eat lunch with me.

                    ANTONIO
          I’ve never been to a fancy
          restaurant.

                    OLIVIA
          You work at a fancy restaurant.

                    ANTONIO
          They don’t let us use the bathroom.
          I have to pee at the gas station.
          I’m really sweating.

Olivia pulls over and stops.

                    OLIVIA
          Antonio -- I need you to get your
          shit together.

                    ANTONIO
          Do you really think anyone’s gonna
          believe you’re dating someone like
          me?

                    OLIVIA
          Not if you can’t stop sweating! You
          look like a dolphin.

Olivia hands him a make-up wipe.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Here. Towel off.

                       ANTONIO
          Thank you.

                    OLIVIA
          Now get your shit together!
                                                 31.


                    ANTONIO
          Okay, okay. My shit -- I think it’s
          together.


INT. ROYCE TOWER, GEORGE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Daniel shows George the photos of Olivia KISSING Antonio.

                    GEORGE
          She must really love me. Going out
          there and kissing a guy like that.

                    DANIEL
          She’s certainly giving it her all.

                    GEORGE
          What’s that supposed to mean?

                    DANIEL
          Nothing. She’s just very convincing.

                    GEORGE
          You make these statements that are
          neutral on the surface, but I know
          what you’re doing -- you’re trying
          to get under my skin.

                    DANIEL
          Just reminding you sometimes actions
          have unintended consequences.

                    GEORGE
          Your negativity’s a real bummer. No
          more photos. Keep me on a need to
          know basis.


EXT. THE IVY RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

The Range Rover pulls up to the Valet Stand. A handful of
PAPARAZZI lay in wait -- some with cameras, some with video.


INT. OLIVA’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Olivia puts the car in park. Antonio takes a breath, anxious.

                    OLIVIA
          Okay, showtime.

She gets out and...
                                                32.


EXT. THE IVY RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

...the CAMERAS start CLICKING. An IVY VALET opens the door
for Antonio. He sheepishly gets out.

                    IVY VALET
          Welcome to The Ivy.

                    ANTONIO
          Thank you. Paint’s chipped on the
          driver’s side and there’s a ding on
          the back bumper.

The Paparazzi confer as they shoot:

                    PAPARAZZI #3
          Who’s that? Is he somebody?

                    PAPARAZZI #4
          Never seen him before.

As Olivia joins Antonio, the Paparazzi shout:

                    PAPARAZZI #4 (CONT'D)
          What happened to George Royce?

                    OLIVIA
          I’ve never met Mr. Royce.

Olivia takes Antonio’s hand.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          This is my boyfriend -- Antonio.

                    PAPARAZZI #5
          Antonio, are you an actor?

                    OLIVIA
          He’s a valet.

                    PAPARAZZI #5
          No, really?

                    OLIVIA
          Really. I’ve dated enough actors.
          They’re too much work.

                    IVY VALET
              (to Antonio)
          Are you really a valet?

                    ANTONIO
          Yes, I work at Kobra.
                                                  33.


The Ivy valet gives Antonio a “fuck yeah” first bump as
Olivia leads Antonio into the restaurant.


EXT. THE IVY RESTAURANT, PATIO - A LITTLE LATER

All eyes are on Olivia and Antonio as they sit at a table
with menus.

                    ANTONIO
          Everyone’s looking at us. I don’t
          like it.

                    OLIVIA
          You get used to it.

                    ANTONIO
          They’re taking photos again. Don’t
          they have enough?

                    OLIVIA
          Say something. I’m gonna laugh
          really hard.

                    ANTONIO
          What? I don’t understand.

She LAUGHS uproariously and touches his arm.

                    OLIVIA
          That’s the one they’re gonna run.
          They always use the laughing shot.

The WAITER steps up.

                    WAITER
          Are you ready to order?

                    OLIVIA
          The small chopped salad. No
          dressing.

                       WAITER
          Sir?

                    ANTONIO
          Do you have hamburgers here?

                    WAITER
          We can do that for you. How would
          you like it prepared?

                    ANTONIO
          With lettuce and tomato.
                                               34.


                    WAITER
          I meant the meat.

                    ANTONIO
          On a bun. Under the lettuce and
          tomato.

                    WAITER
          How do you want it cooked, sir?

                    ANTONIO
          Very cooked. All the way through.

                       WAITER
          Well-done.

                       ANTONIO
          Thank you.

The waiter nods, and walks off.

                    OLIVIA
          Maybe the less you say the better.

                    ANTONIO
          I should go wash my hands -- I
          touch a lot of keys.

Olivia starts answering emails as Antonio gets up.

He walks towards the bathroom, a CUSTOMER mistakes Antonio
for a busboy, and flags him down, holding up his empty glass.

                    CUSTOMER
          Could I get more iced tea?

                    ANTONIO
          Um, actually, I’m not--

But then Antonio sees a PITCHER nearby at the bus station
and, what the hell, it’ll be easier to just pour the drink.
He grabs the iced tea and refills the glass.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          There you go.

As Antonio goes to return the pitcher, a customer at another
table signals for him. Resigned, Antonio fills her glass too.

Olivia looks up, shocked to see Antonio continue around the
table pouring everyone iced tea. She rolls her eyes -- this
guy’s hopeless. She stops an actual BUSBOY.
                                                35.


                    OLIVIA
          Would you mind doing that for him?


EXT. ROBERTSON BOULEVARD - LATER

Parked across the street, Stegman takes photos of the
“couple” from his Yaris.

PAN to REVEAL Perez, two cars back, watching while he dials
his phone on speaker.

                     HOST (O.S.)
          The Ivy.

                    PEREZ
          You guys deliver?

                    HOST (O.S.)
          Depends, how close are you?

                    PEREZ
          Very. Now be honest -- the risotto,
          does it travel?


EXT. THE IVY RESTAURANT, PATIO - LATER

The waiter brings the food -- a burger for Antonio, a small
salad for Olivia.

                    ANTONIO
          Is that all you’re eating?

                    OLIVIA
          My premiere’s on Thursday and I
          have a very unforgiving dress to
          squeeze into -- this is pretty much
          my last non-juice meal.

                    ANTONIO
          Is that healthy?

                    OLIVIA
          Nope, not on any level.
              (then, back to business)
          By the way, you’re gonna be my
          date.

                    ANTONIO
          To a Hollywood movie premiere?
                                                  36.


                    OLIVIA
          If we’re seen on the red carpet,
          it’ll kill any last rumors about me
          and George.

                     ANTONIO
          I need to get a tuxedo, right? And
          a haircut?

                    OLIVIA
          I have people who’ll take care of
          everything for you.

                    ANTONIO
          Are you sure? My cousin Chucho owns a
          tux rental store and they have a
          barbershop right in back.

                    OLIVIA
          No insult to Chucho, but let my
          people fix you up.

                    ANTONIO
          He’ll give me a good deal. Probably
          throw in shoes for free.

                     OLIVIA
          It’s okay.
              (then, sizing him up)
          And how committed are you to the
          mustache?

                    ANTONIO
          You don’t like it?

                    OLIVIA
          I’m sure there was a time it was
          very fashionable.

As Antonio uses his knife to look at his mustache, the iced
tea Customer walks by and does a double-take when he sees the
“busboy” sitting with Olivia Allan.


EXT. KOBRA - A LITTLE LATER

Antonio hops out of Olivia’s car.

                    ANTONIO
          Thanks again for lunch.

As she drives off, the valets rush over.
                                                 37.


                    RUDY
          Guey, you’re blowing up the
          internet.

Rudy shows him papparazzi photos from The Ivy.

                    ANTONIO
          What? That just happened.

                    RUDY
          “The Actress and the Valet.” You’re
          mythic. It’s like a Cinderella
          story in reverse.

                    BENNY
          Have you had sex with her? Don’t
          tell me if you’ve had sex with her!
          Don’t tell me!

                     ANTONIO
          Okay.

                    BENNY
          You’re having sex with her, you
          bastard! I know you’re having sex
          with her! Tell me you’re having sex
          with her! Tell me!

                    ANTONIO
          I don’t know what you want to hear.

                    BENNY
          I don’t want to hear anything!

                    JAVIER
          Flying too close to the sun,
          brother. They don’t like us dating
          their women. That’s when they start
          asking questions. That’s when they
          deport you.

                    ANTONIO
          I’m legal. I’m a citizen.

                     JAVIER
          You are?

                    ANTONIO
          Yeah. You’re not?

                    JAVIER
              (covering)
          Yeah, I’m totally legal.
                                                38.


                    BENNY
              (re: photo)
          And what’re you saying that’s so
          funny? You’ve never once made me
          laugh.


INT. ISABEL’S APARTMENT - LATER

Isabel, on her laptop, pours over pictures of Antonio and
Olivia. Marco gets himself a glass of milk.

                    ISABEL
          Did you know about this?

                    MARCO
          No -- but I’m only with him three
          days a week.

                    ISABEL
          And he hasn’t said anything about
          being with one of the most famous
          women in the world?

                    MARCO
          Dad doesn’t talk about his sex
          life.

                    ISABEL
          They’re having sex?!

                    MARCO
          I don’t know. I’m as shocked as
          you. I had no idea Dad had this
          kind of game.

                    ISABEL
          He doesn’t have game. He has no
          game. He’s game free. He has minus
          game.

                    MARCO
          He’s got something. He’s dating
          Olivia Allan. Listen, you’ll always
          be my mom, but if she ends up being
          my second mom, I’d be kinda
          psyched. It’s good for actors to be
          around other actors.


EXT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE - LATER

As Olivia and Amanda walk to the front door, a Latinx POOL
MAN emerges from the back, carrying his gear.
                                                39.


                    POOL MAN
          Hi, Ms. Allan. I fixed the filter.

                    OLIVIA
          Thank you, Hugo.

                    POOL MAN
          So, uh... if it doesn’t work out
          with the Valet, and you ever want
          to get a beer or something, my
          number’s on the bill.

He walks off, throwing his skimmer in the back of his truck.
Olivia smiles at Amanda -- it’s working.


INT. BENTLEY - LATER

Kathryn drives, on speaker:

                    KATHRYN
          Obviously I owe you an apology.


INT. ROYCE TOWER, GEORGE’S OFFICE - INTERCUT

George at his desk, also on speaker.

                    GEORGE
              (coyly)
          Oh, why is that?

                    KATHRYN
          Olivia and that guy are all over
          the tabloids.

                       GEORGE
          Really?

                    KATHRYN
          I feel silly, honey. I acted like a
          crazy person.

                    GEORGE
          I’m just sorry you had to go
          through that. Must’ve been a real
          emotional rollercoaster.

George does a little victory dance, then:

                    KATHRYN
          I just love you so much.
                                               40.


                    GEORGE
          I love you so much.

                    KATHRYN
          I have to run, but I’ll see you
          tonight for dinner.

She kisses him through the phone then hangs up. Then
immediately makes another call.


INT. RANCHO PARK DRIVING RANGE - INTERCUT

Stegman hits a long drive, then answers his phone:

                     STEGMAN
          Stegman.

                    KATHRYN
          What do you got?

                    STEGMAN
          Looks legit, ma’am. I sniffed
          around -- Ms. Allan’s even taking
          the Mexican dude to her premiere.

                    KATHRYN
          There’s a lie here somewhere, we
          just haven’t found it yet.


EXT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Antonio waits in a DESIGNER TUX, a fresh haircut, and NO
MUSTACHE. He checks himself in the window of a dirty Nissan.
He has to admit he looks pretty damn sharp. He shoots himself
with some FINGER GUNS, a la Randy, then instantly regrets it.

A LIMO pulls up.

                    LIMO DRIVER
          Sorry, I’m late. I was sure I had
          the wrong address.


INT. LIMO - LATER

Antonio takes it all in -- TV, champagne, snacks, treats.

                    ANTONIO
          How much are the peanuts?

                    LIMO DRIVER
          They’re free, sir.
                                               41.


                    ANTONIO
          And the Kit Kat bars?

                    LIMO DRIVER
          Everything’s for your enjoyment.

Delighted, Antonio helps himself to one of everything. As he
savors a bite of CANDY, the limo stops at a light...


EXT. STREET - INTERCUT

...and Natalie pedals up next to them on her bike. She wears
a backpack adorned with a “Reclaim Los Angeles” sticker.
Antonio lowers his window.

                    ANTONIO
          Hi, Natalie.

She turns, surprised to see Antonio in the back.

                    NATALIE
          Holy shit -- so it’s true. All the
          metiches were gossiping about you
          and the famous movie star.

                    ANTONIO
          Yes, I’m about to pick her up. I’m
          going to a premiere.

                    NATALIE
          That’s just crazy. Makes me like
          her a little more.

The light changes and the limo drives off.

                    ANTONIO
          See you later.

                      NATALIE
          Have fun!

As the limo cruises down Pico, Antonio watches his
neighborhood roll by from a new perspective. There’s LIFE
EVERYWHERE -- taqueros grill carne asada on a cart, kids play
soccer in a parking lot, a young Korean couple sip Slurpees
on the hood of a car -- everything looks twenty percent more
beautiful from the back of a luxury vehicle.

They stop at the next light. Seconds later, Natalie rides up.

                    NATALIE (CONT'D)
          Hello again.
                                                42.


                    ANTONIO
          This is what I always tell everyone
          -- bikes are just as fast as cars.

                     NATALIE
          Right?
              (then)
          Did you shave your mustache?

                    ANTONIO
          What do you think?

                    NATALIE
          I like it better.

                    ANTONIO
          I’ve had a mustache for twenty
          years, why did nobody say anything?

The light changes, and the limo takes off again.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          See you at the next light!


EXT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE - LATER

In the driveway, Antonio waits by the limo eating a BAG OF
CHEX MIX. Olivia steps out, a vision of glamour and elegance.

                    ANTONIO
          You look very nice.

                    OLIVIA
          It only took an army of people
          twelve hours to assemble me.

She sizes him up -- he cleaned up better than she expected.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Yeah, good -- this’ll work.

                    ANTONIO
          I had to knock on every door in my
          building to find someone who could
          tie a bow tie. Turns out the new
          guy downstairs is a caterer.

He opens the door for her.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          I don’t need help with this part.
                                                43.


INT. LIMO - LATER

Antonio sits next to Olivia who is lying down on the seat
talking on the phone.

                    OLIVIA
          Of course I’m lying down to avoid
          wrinkles. I’m not an amatuer. What
          are the early reviews? No, I don’t
          want to know. Unless they’re good.
          No, no, don’t tell my anything.
          Unless they’re really, really good.

                    ANTONIO
          Champagne? There’s no charge.

She holds out her glass and he pours.

                    OLIVIA
          Yeah, he’s right here...
              (to Antonio)
          My publicist. She’s worried you’re
          gonna say something stupid.

                    ANTONIO
          Me too. I’m starting to sweat
          again.

                     OLIVIA
          Oh, Jesus.
              (then, into phone)
          Here, talk to him. Tell him to stop
          sweating.

Olivia puts her phone on speaker:

                    JENNIFER (O.S.)
          Try not to say anything. They’ll
          mostly be focused on Olivia.

                    ANTONIO
          I don’t want to say anything.

                    OLIVIA
          Good.

                    JENNIFER (O.S.)
          But if you have to, just say
          something like you’re here to
          support Olivia on her big night.

                    ANTONIO
          Olivia. Big night.
                                                  44.


Olivia grabs the phone back -- off speaker.

                    OLIVIA
          How fast can you get us through the
          line?... God bless you.

She hangs up and downs an ATIVAN with the Cristal.

                    ANTONIO
          Do you think that’s a good idea?

                    OLIVIA
          I have a lot riding on this movie.

                    ANTONIO
          It’s just we had Alcohol Awareness
          training at the restaurant and
          mixing medication and liquor is a
          flashing red light.

                    OLIVIA
          That’s exactly the kind of thing
          you shouldn’t say tonight.
              (then, noticing)
          Shit, I’m wrinkling.

She grabs the bottle and pours herself another.


EXT. FOX THEATER - LATER

BIG PREMIERE for “Earhart” -- klieg lights, screaming fans,
paparazzi, reporters, the full circus.

The LIMO door opens. Olivia steps onto the RED CARPET and the
place goes wild. Olivia waves to the crowd as Antonio
nervously follows behind her.

Photographers spring into action. Cameras CLICK! Bulbs POP!

                    PHOTOGRAPHERS
          Olivia, over here! Olivia!

She’s all charm, flashing her megawatt smile. Antonio stands
frozen next to her, disoriented, blinded by all the flashes.

                    PHOTOGRAPHERS (CONT'D)
          Antonio! Antonio! Get closer!

Olivia takes his arm, snuggling into him as they pose.

                    PHOTOGRAPHERS (CONT'D)
          Antonio! Over here! Antonio!
                                               45.


“Antonio’s” come from all directions. Antonio turns left.
Then right. The shouts keep coming. Antonio keeps turning,
trying to please everyone.

Olivia’s publicist, JENNIFER (30s, loves the game) swoops in:

                    JENNIFER
          There’s America Sweethearts! Come
          on, the vultures are waiting.

CLOSE ON -- AN OLD TELEVISION

As Olivia and Antonio get interviewed by NANCY O’DELL.

                    NANCY O’DELL
          I’m told you’re wearing Stella
          McCartney -- stunning.

                    OLIVIA
          She can make anyone look good.

PULL BACK to REVEAL...


INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - INTERCUT

Cecilia watches the show flanked by two young KOREAN KIDS.

                    CECILIA
          My son! My son! On the television!

Mr. Kim rushes in with sandwiches.

                    NANCY O’DELL
          So, Antonio, is this your first
          premiere?

Antonio smiles and nods, trying to look natural. He does not.

                    NANCY O’DELL (CONT'D)
          Pretty exciting, right?

Antonio just keeps smiling and nodding.

                     CECILIA
          What’s he doing? Why is he smiling
          like that?

                    MR. KIM
              (in Korean)
          Why do you speak to me in Spanish,
          woman? I don’t speak Spanish.
              (to his grandchildren)
          Do either of you speak Spanish?
                                                 46.


                    KOREAN KID
          Grandpa, we have no idea what
          you’re saying.

On the RED CARPET, Nancy O’Dell, having given up on Antonio,
turns back to Olivia:

                    NANCY O’DELL
          New movie. New company. This is a
          big year for you.

                    OLIVIA
          Yeah, I’m just really thrilled to
          tell this inspiring story about
          this incredible woman...

As they continue talking, a reporter from Despierta America,
ANA PATRICIA GAMEZ, approaches:

                    ANA PATRICIA
          Antonio, our viewers love you.

                    ANTONIO
          Ana Patricia? My mother watches you
          everyday.

Olivia tries to continue her interview, but is distracted by
Antonio engaging with a reporter.

                    OLIVIA
          ...um, and we had many inspiring
          woman behind the camera too. Excuse
          me.

                    ANA PATRICIA
          What’re you wearing tonight?

                    ANTONIO
          A tuxedo. It’s mine. I own it.

Olivia swoops over.

                    OLIVIA
          We should really keep moving, honey.

As she leads Antonio off, he turns to the TV camera:

                    ANTONIO
          Sorry, Chucho!


INT. TUXEDO SHOP - CONTINUOUS

CHUCHO fastens a cummerbund to a mannequin as he watches TV.
                                               47.


                    CHUCHO
          What the fuck?!


INT. FOX THEATER - LATER

A packed house. Antonio, with two huge buckets of popcorn and
two giant Cokes, sits down next to Olivia.

                    ANTONIO
          I know you said you didn’t want
          anything, but it’s all free.

As the lights dim, Olivia surreptitiously pops another
Ativan, then grabs a soda to wash it down.


INT. W HOTEL - LATER

The AFTER PARTY, elaborately decorated with a historic
aviation theme -- prop planes, waitstaff with leather hats
and goggles, etc...

Amanda leads Olivia, with champagne, and Antonio to the VIP
SECTION. As guests congratulate Olivia, Antonio looks around,
astonished at how much money was spent on this event.

                     AMANDA
          Here’s your table. I’ll get you
          more champagne.
              (then)
          Antonio?

                    ANTONIO
          I’m just here to support Olivia on
          her big night.

                    OLIVIA
          Where was that on the red carpet?

As Amanda heads off, she passes a gorgeous ITALIAN MODEL and
a hip FASHION DESIGNER, who check out Antonio.

                    ITALIAN MODEL
          He’s not bad looking, but... what
          am I missing?

                    FASHION DESIGNER
          Historically, the world’s greatest
          lovers have not been attractive
          men. Casanova was considered quite
          homely in his day but four
          centuries later, he still sets the
          sexual bar.
                                                 48.


The model looks again at Antonio, her interest piqued.

ANGLE ON: OLIVIA AND ANTONIO.

                    OLIVIA
          We only need to stay for like
          twenty minutes, then--
              (noticing)
          Oh, shit. No. No. No. No.

ACROSS THE ROOM -- GEORGE and KATHRYN chat with the a STYLISH
WOMAN in her 70s with big glasses.

                       ANTONIO
          What?

                       OLIVIA
          He’s here.

                    ANTONIO
          Who’s here?

                    OLIVIA
          With Kathryn.

                    ANTONIO
          Who’s Kathryn?

                    OLIVIA
          George’s wife.

                    ANTONIO
          Who’s George?

                    OLIVIA
          The married guy. My boyfriend. This
          was all explained to you.

                    ANTONIO
          There were a lot of names. It was
          very confusing! Where are they?

                    OLIVIA
          Over by the propeller ice sculpture.
          She doesn’t look depressed. Does she
          look depressed to you?

                    ANTONIO
          Maybe a little sad around the eyes.

As the Stylish Woman escorts George and Kathryn towards them:
                                                49.


                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          They’re coming. Should I do
          something? Should I hold your hand?

                    OLIVIA
          Yes. No. I think so. I don’t know.
          Kiss me. Don’t kiss me.

Antonio takes her hand -- his support helps calm her down.

                    STYLISH WOMAN
          Olivia, meet my dear friend,
          Kathryn Royce -- we’re on the board
          of the Red Cross together -- and
          her husband, George. This is Olivia
          Allan, and the famous Antonio.

Smiles all around -- hiding what’s really going on.

                    KATHRYN
          We had to come over. We’ve seen all
          your movies.

                    OLIVIA
          That’s so nice.

                    KATHRYN
          But this one might be my favorite.
          Very empowering.

                    GEORGE
          Honey, we shouldn’t monopolize her.

                    KATHRYN
          The Actress and the Valet. I’m
          dying to know how you two met.

AT THE BUFFET Amanda sees -- George and Kathryn with Olivia.
Uh-oh. She hurries over.

                    OLIVIA
          Well, I got a flat tire in Beverly
          Hills and this handsome man pulls
          up in a Ferrari--

                    ANTONIO
          The F8 Spider.

                    OLIVIA
          --and by the time he had the spare
          on, I was smitten.
                                                 50.


                    GEORGE
          Love always finds its way. It was
          so nice meeting you both.

George tries to lead Kathryn off.

                    KATHRYN
          Out of curiosity -- when did you
          find out he was just parking it?

Amanda swoops in.

                    AMANDA
          Excuse me, I need to borrow these
          two.

                    OLIVIA
          He told me right away. And thank
          God. I can’t stand guys who drive
          showy cars.

                    KATHRYN
          Well, you’d never like George. He
          has a warehouse full of them.

Amanda rushes Olivia and Antonio off.


EXT. W HOTEL, STREET - LATER

Stegman sits in his car, staking-out the main entrance as
limo drivers, paparazzi, and autograph hounds, mill about.

A KNOCK. He looks up, sees Perez, and rolls down the window.

                    STEGMAN
          Hey, a blast from the past. What’re
          you doing here?

                    PEREZ
          You know, someone’s screwing someone
          they’re not supposed to. You?

                     STEGMAN
          Same. Homo Sapiens, bro -- flawed
          creatures.

Perez hands him a take-out bag.

                    PEREZ
          I got an extra falafel. You
          interested?
                                                  51.


                    STEGMAN
          From the Falafel King? Hell yes.

Stegman opens the bag.

                    PEREZ
          Forgot napkins. You still keep a
          stash in the glove department?

                    STEGMAN
          I upgraded to moist towelettes.

As Stegman reaches for the napkins, Perez surreptitiously
plants an AUDIO BUGGING DEVICE under the seat. Unaware,
Stegman sits back and takes a bite.

                    STEGMAN (CONT'D)
          Best falafel in the city. They
          never skimp on the tahini.


INT. W HOTEL, BATHROOM - LATER

Olivia, rummaging through her purse, talks to Amanda.

                    OLIVIA
          Why would he bring her here? It
          doesn’t make any sense. And where
          the hell’s my Ativan?

                    AMANDA
          In your hand.

As she pops a pill, George pokes his head in.

                    GEORGE
          My apologies. I thought this was
          the men’s room.

                       OLIVIA
          She knows.

George slips in -- locking the door behind him.

                    GEORGE
          I’m sorry. Kathryn got the tickets.
          She sprung them on me last minute.
          I’m in hell.

                    AMANDA
          I should wait outside, right?
                                                52.


                      OLIVIA
          No.
              (to George)
          She’s nothing like you described.
          She’s regal and elegant and brings
          disaster relief to poor countries.
          Why would you divorce somebody like
          that?

                      GEORGE
          Because   I’m in love with you.
          Because   nothing I’ve ever done or
          said or   felt makes any sense
          without   you.

                    AMANDA
          There’s a level of intimacy here
          that’s becoming uncomfortable for
          me.

                    OLIVIA
          I had this whole narrative going in
          my head about how awful she was so
          I could justify my behavior, but--

                    GEORGE
          She’s good at cocktail parties.
          She’s a monster at home. Come on,
          Olivia, we’re so close. She’s
          totally buying it.

He goes to kiss her, but she pushes him away.

                    OLIVIA
          I can’t handle this right now.

As she storms out, he calls after her:

                    GEORGE
          Your movie was amazing, by the way.

                    OLIVIA
          You should’ve led with that.

Amanda and George, alone in the Ladies Room, awkwardly look
at each other.

                    AMANDA
          This is not what I thought this job
          was gonna be.
                                                  53.


INT. W HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

Antonio stands near the kitchen. As servers pass by with
appetizers, he takes one from every tray, politely saying
“thank you” as he neatly places them on his plate.

A party guest, thinking Antonio’s a waiter, walks by and
takes a mini mushroom tart off his plate.

                       ANTONIO
            Actually, I’m not the--
                (then)
            I recommend the crab cakes.

Then Antonio sees -- Olivia, across the room, grab a bottle
of champagne off the bar. Yikes. He starts after her but
Kathryn stops him.

                      KATHRYN
            Whatever my husband’s paying you,
            I’ll double it. I’ll quadruple it.

Oh, shit.

                      ANTONIO
            I... I don’t know what you’re
            talking about.

                      KATHRYN
            How long do we have to play this
            game? I’ll give you a hundred
            thousand dollars.

                         ANTONIO
            Excuse me?

                         KATHRYN
            Cash.

Antonio takes a breath -- that’s a lot of dough.

                      KATHRYN (CONT'D)
            There’s no way Olivia Allan’s
            wasting her time with a valet.

                      ANTONIO
            Ma’am, I don’t get paid a lot --
            although tips are pretty good on
            the weekends -- so I’d love to take
            your money but I can’t. I know it’s
            hard to believe but maybe Olivia
            isn’t as superficial as you are.
                      (MORE)
                                                54.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          And maybe you’ve underestimated the
          passion and charisma of a Latin
          man. Buenas noches.

Antonio, surprised by his own eloquence, walks off. Kathryn
watches him go -- is it possible they really are a couple?


INT. W HOTEL - LATER

In a QUIET STAIRWELL, Olivia, intoxicated, rests her head on
the empty champagne bottle. Antonio rushes in.

                       ANTONIO
          You okay?

                    OLIVIA
          One too many Ativans. Five too many
          champagnes. I want to go home now.

She stands -- but she’s too woozy, and STUMBLES back down.

                    ANTONIO
          I’ll call the limo.

                    OLIVIA
          No. No drunk Olivia pictures.
          Women’s stories.


INT. W HOTEL, KITCHEN - LATER

Olivia leans on Antonio, as they make their way through the
maze of activity passing DISHWASHERS, COOKS, and BUSBOYS.

                    DISHWASHER
          Hey, it’s Antonio the valet!

                    COOK
          The legend!

The kitchen staff applaud.

                    ANTONIO
          The food’s very delicious. Thank
          you for all your hard work.


EXT. W HOTEL - LOADING DOCK - LATER

Antonio helps Olivia out the back door.
                                                55.


                    OLIVIA
          I was a pastry chef in a movie.
          Pofiteroles. Plofiteroles.
          Profliteroles.

A tricked-out PICK-UP TRUCK screeches to a stop -- Javier and
Rudy in the front cab. Noticing his suit:

                    RUDY
          You clean up nice, bro. Is that one
          of Chucho’s?

                    JAVIER
          Hurry up, they profile in this
          neighborhood.

Rudy hops out, and together they maneuver Olivia into...


INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

...the back. As Antonio climbs in next to Olivia, she slowly
topples over onto the seat, passed-out.

                    RUDY
          Whoa, shit!

                    JAVIER
          Is she dead?

                    ANTONIO
          She’s not dead. She just drank too
          much and took a few pills.

                    RUDY
          That’s a flashing red light.
          Weren’t you at the seminar?

                    ANTONIO
          I know!

                    JAVIER
          I can’t be in a truck where some
          rich white lady OD’s.

                    ANTONIO
          She’s not gonna OD!

A LINEN TRUCK pulls into the alleyway.

                    JAVIER
          Shit. We gotta get out of here.

Antonio gently tries to rouse Olivia.
                                               56.


                    ANTONIO
          Olivia. We need your address.

                    OLIVIA
          Glass. View. Mountains.

                    ANTONIO
          Olivia. Please, wake up.

                    OLIVIA
          Take a right at Sylvester
          Stallone’s house.

But then she falls back asleep.

                     JAVIER
          Guey! Now! I’m not going back to
          Matehuala!

                    ANTONIO
          Just take her to my place.

Paparazzi and fans wait for celebrities. The PICK-UP TRUCK
drives by, unnoticed -- with seemingly only Rudy in the car.


INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Rudy looks in his rearview mirror.

                    RUDY
          All clear, guys.

Antonio and Javier pop their heads back up.

                    JAVIER
          Okay, keep it at thirty-five, and
          use your signal.

                    RUDY
          Is anyone else hungry?

                    JAVIER
          No. Are you insane? No stops!


EXT. ARBY’S ROAST BEEF - A LITTLE LATER

The truck idles in the DRIVE THRU LINE. Rudy orders, yelling
into the speaker.
                                                57.


                    RUDY
          Two Beef ‘n’ Cheddars, a curly fry
          and, uh... what to drink, what to
          drink?

                    JAVIER
          Make a decision! We look like
          kidnappers!

                    ANTONIO
          He has blood sugar issues. You know
          that.

                    RUDY
          Thank you. You guys sure you don’t
          want anything? We’re here.

                    ANTONIO
          Get me a Buttermilk Crispy Chicken.
          And lots of packets of mayo and
          mustard. I’m out at home.

                    RUDY
          Should we get anything for her?

                    ANTONIO
          No, she doesn’t eat.

                    JAVIER
          And she’s passed out! Can we please
          get out of here?!

                    RUDY
          Last chance, Javy. I’m not sharing.

                    JAVIER
          Fine, a Beef ‘n’ Cheddar. And some
          Mozzarella sticks.

Olivia wakes up.

                      OLIVIA
          Hi, guys.

They all react, startled.

                    ANTONIO
          Ahh! Olivia -- you’re up. These are
          my friends, Javy and Rudy.

                    OLIVIA
          You’re cute, Rudy. Want to go out
          with my assistant? She’s prettier
          than she thinks she is.
                                                58.


                    ANTONIO
          We need to know where you live so--

But -- she passes out again. Rudy shrugs and orders:

                    RUDY
          Okay, three beef ‘n’ cheddars. One
          Buttermilk Chicken. A curly fry.
          Mozzarella sticks. A vanilla shake.

                    ANTONIO
          And as much mayo and mustard as you
          can give us.

                    CASHIER (O.S.)
          That’ll be twenty-seven fifty. Pay
          at the window.

Rudy drives up, then turns to the guys.

                    RUDY
          Okay, fellas -- nine bucks each.

Each valet pulls out a ROLL OF TIP MONEY and peels off nine
singles.


EXT. ANTONIO'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Carrying a groggy Olivia, Antonio shuts the truck door.

                    ANTONIO
          I owe you guys.

                    RUDY
          Yeah, so find out -- if that was a
          real offer, I’d totally go out with
          her assistant. Maybe the four of us
          could go on a hike or something.
          Low key, no stress.

                    JAVIER
          Work out the details later! Get
          inside!
              (re: drunk Olivia)
          This is not a good look!

Antonio starts up the stairs as they drive away.
                                               59.


INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Cecilia, on the couch, watches a movie DUBBED IN SPANISH. The
door opens and Antonio, with Olivia in his arms, enters. As
he carries her across the living room:

                    ANTONIO
          Hi, Mama -- this is Olivia.

                      OLIVIA
          Hi, Mama.

                    CECILIA
          I want to remind you the walls are
          very thin. I can hear everything.

                    ANTONIO
          We’re just going to sleep.

                    CECILIA
          You’re a grown man -- do what you
          want. But the walls are very thin.

Antonio and Olivia disappear down the hall.


INT. ANTONIO’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Antonio carries Olivia to the bed. As soon as he puts her
down, she starts UNZIPPING her dress.

                      OLIVIA
          Sleep.

                    ANTONIO
          No, no! Dress stays on. You’re
          sleeping in your clothes.

He ZIPS her back up, but then she yanks the dress off over
her head...

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          No, no, please!

...REVEALING an elaborate NUDE BODYSUIT with lots of body
tape and other tricks of the trade, holding all the various
parts in place. There’s nothing sexy about it.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          Alright. We’re good.

She plops onto the bed and instantly FALLS ASLEEP. Antonio
gently places the comforter over her.
                                                60.


INT. ANTONIO'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Antonio quietly steps out of his room.

                    CECILIA
          Son. Come sit with me.

Antonio joins her on the couch as she mutes the TV.

                    CECILIA (CONT'D)
          It took me forty-eight years after
          your dad died to find love again.

                    ANTONIO
          With Mr. Kim? You’re calling that
          love now?

                    CECILIA
          Ha-Joon. That’s his name. I missed
          out on a lot of living. I’m glad to
          see you’re not making the same
          mistake.

                    ANTONIO
          It’s more complicated than--

                    CECILIA
          Don’t make it complicated. Isabel’s
          the mother of my grandson -- I love
          her -- but she’s acting like an
          idiot.

                    ANTONIO
          She’s just going through--

                    CECILIA
          No. You’re a great person and if
          she can’t see that... well, I’m
          glad you’re moving on.

                    ANTONIO
          Mama--

                     CECILIA
          Change is good, Antonio, even if
          you don’t know why when it happens.
              (then)
          I like this actress. Would’ve been
          happier if she was Mexican, but she
          seems nice in the movies. I’ve said
          my piece.

She UNMUTES THE TV. As Antonio sits back to watch with his
mom, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small box:
                                                61.


                    ANTONIO
          Junior Mint?


INT. ANTONIO’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

Sunlight pours through the curtains on a hungover Olivia in
bed. Her eyes slowly open. She looks around. Where am I? She
sees Antonio asleep on a beat-up old barcalounger.

                      OLIVIA
          Oh, God.

As quietly as possible, she sits up, grabs her phone from her
purse and starts scrolling through texts.

                    ANTONIO (O.S.)
          Good morning.

                      OLIVIA
                (embarrassed)
          Hi.

                    ANTONIO
          I want you to know nothing
          happened. I didn’t even look. And I
          slept in my pants.

                    OLIVIA
          Thanks for taking care of me --
          last night was not my finest
          performance.

                    ANTONIO
          You would’ve done the same for me.

                    OLIVIA
          I’d like to think so, but probably
          not. What’s your address so I can
          tell my assistant?

                    ANTONIO
          1285 Valencia. South Valencia. If
          they go to North Valencia -- it’s a
          batting cage.

As Olivia TEXTS her assistant:

                    OLIVIA
          And what about a coffee place? Is
          there one near here?

                    ANTONIO
          I could make you a cup of coffee.
                                                 62.


                    OLIVIA
          Any chance you have almond milk?

                       ANTONIO
          No chance.

She stands and the full force of her HANGOVER hits her.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          I do have aspirin.


INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Antonio and Olivia, back in her dress, step out of the
bedroom to find --

Fifteen STARSTRUCK MEXICANS, MR. KIM and a five or six of his
Korean relatives -- all smiling at them.

They prepared an elaborate FEAST -- chilaquiles, chorizo and
eggs, pan dulce, as well as kimchi and bibimbap.

                       ANTONIO
          Mama!

                    CECILIA
          I told one person. Maybe two.

                    ANTONIO
              (to Olivia)
          Sorry about this.
              (then, introducing)
          My sister, Clara. You met Benny. My
          nephews, Dante and Luca. Mr. Kim,
          my landlord, and I’m assuming, his
          family.

                    MR. KIM
              (holds up his phone)
          Picture?

                    CLARA
          Wasn’t gonna ask, but if we’re doing
          pictures, I want in on that too.

                    ANTONIO
          My Tia, Laura. My cousins and...
          these people I’ve never seen before.

                    OLIVIA
          Nice to meet you all.
                                                 63.


                    CLARA
          You must be hungry, Olivia. I’ll
          make you a plate.

                    ANTONIO
          She just wants a coffee. Can we not
          make this a big deal?

                    CECILIA
          Don’t deprive me of this.

Cecilia brings coffee as Benny holds up some sweet breads.

                    BENNY
          Got to try one of these conchas.
          Drove all the way out to Alhambra.

                    OLIVIA
          Actually, I should get going.

                    BENNY
          I’m just gonna cut you a little
          square. You’ll thank me.

He does, and hands it to her.

                    ANTONIO
          You don’t have to eat anything you
          don’t want to.

Outraged, they jump all over Antonio:

                    EVERYONE
          She looks hungry. / This food is
          delicious. / I drove all the way
          out to Alhambra! / She’s a guest.

                    OLIVIA
          It’s probably good for me to put
          something in my stomach anyway.
              (takes a bite)
          Wow, that’s really delicious.

                    BENNY
          Right? Try dipping it in the coffee.

Dante and Luca show a photo on their iPad to a couple Korean
kids, WHISPERING:

                    DANTE
          Pretty sure these are her boobs.
                                                 64.


                    CLARA
          You said you’d leave that in the
          car! Turn it off, Monstro! Now!

Once again, they ignore her. Clara turns back to Olivia:

                    CLARA (CONT'D)
          We’re really excited for your movie.
          Been reading about it everywhere.

                    OLIVIA
          Don’t tell me what they’re saying.
          I’ve stopped looking at reviews --
          they really mess with your head.

                    BENNY
          Tell me about it. I got a bad one
          on Yelp once. Still keeps me up at
          night. “Left the car smelling like
          a Russian Bowling League.” What’s
          that even supposed to mean?

A KNOCK. Antonio opens the door to find Isabel and Marco.

                    ANTONIO
          Hi. Thought I didn’t have Marco
          until the weekend.

                    ISABEL
          He forgot his math book again.

As Marco rushes in, Isabel sees Olivia. She tries to hide it,
but she’s flustered.

                    ISABEL (CONT'D)
          Oh, sorry, didn’t know you had
          company -- Marco, I’ll be in the
          car.

Isabel leaves. Antonio, upset, heads to his bedroom.

                    ANTONIO
          I need to go to work.


INT. ANTONIO'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Antonio enters and sits on the bed, putting his head in his
hands. Olivia gently knocks.

                    OLIVIA
          Was that your ex or something?
                                                 65.


                    ANTONIO
          We’re separated. I’ve been trying
          to get her back but now she sees me
          with you and I’ve blown it.

                    OLIVIA
          You don’t know that.

                    ANTONIO
          I look like a playboy.

                    OLIVIA
          Who broke up with who?

                    ANTONIO
          She broke up with me.

                    OLIVIA
          You didn’t blow it. Trust me.

Antonio’s phone buzzes with a TEXT.

                    ANTONIO
          Isabel.

Olivia smiles -- “I told you so.”

                     ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          She needs me to sign some field
          trip form.

                    OLIVIA
          I guarantee you there’s no field
          trip.


EXT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Antonio and Isabel talk on the balcony.

                    ISABEL
          I feel a little blindsided. I mean,
          I told you about Randy, and that’s
          not even that serious--

                    ANTONIO
          Don’t you need me to sign something?

                     ISABEL
          No! It’s not for weeks.
              (then)
          I mean, I’m happy for you. It’s
          great. You’re moving on which is
          great.
                                                66.


                    ANTONIO
          It’s not what you--

                    ISABEL
          I mean, I guess I’m the one who
          said we should date other people so
          I’m glad that you’re dating other
          people. Which is good. So good. I
          mean, do you love-- No, forget it.
          Are you going to the Oscars? I
          don’t want to know. Tell Marco to
          hurry up.

She turns and rushes off. Antonio SMILES to himself -- maybe
Olivia was right, then...


INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

...steps back inside to find Marco chatting with Olivia who’s
enjoying a second concha, dipping it in her coffee.

                    MARCO
          ...yeah, so we’re doing Midsummer
          Night’s Dream. I’d love if you
          could come. I’m Lysander.

                    OLIVIA
          Ooh, one of the lovers. That’s a
          great part.

                    MARCO
          I think I found a new way in. I’m
          playing him like he has a secret.

                    ANTONIO
          Marco, she’s not going to a high
          school production of Shakespeare.

                    BENNY
          Unabridged.

                    CLARA
          No one asked you, Cerdito.

                    BENNY
          Just thought she should have all
          the information. Two and half
          hours, not counting intermission.

                    ANTONIO
          Your mom’s waiting for you.
                                                67.


                    MARCO
          Okay, okay -- bye, everyone.
              (to Olivia)
          Fingers crossed, we both have big
          openings this weekend.

Marco dashes out as Olivia’s phone BUZZES.

                    OLIVIA
          My assistant -- I should go, too.

                    CLARA
          Let me make you a care package.

                    OLIVIA
          That’s so nice, but--

                    CECILIA
          Give her some food! Why is no one
          giving her food?!

                    ANTONIO
          Don’t fight it. No one walks out of
          here empty-handed.


EXT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Antonio and Olivia, holding a tinfoil CARE PACKAGE, head down
the stairs. Family and friends huddle in the doorway, waving
and taking pictures.

                    FAMILY
          Bye, bye./Warm the conchas before
          you eat them./They’re from
          Alhambra.

                    ANTONIO
          Sorry again. There’s no word for
          “boundaries” in Spanish.

                     OLIVIA
          I liked it. I don’t see my family
          that much.

They reach the SIDEWALK.

                    ANTONIO
          And you’re right. Isabel’s jealous.

                    OLIVIA
          Maybe we’ll both get what we want
          out of this craziness.
                                                  68.


Amanda pulls up to the curb.

                    AMANDA
          Sorry, Waze took me to a batting
          cage.

                    OLIVIA
          Alright, well, I think this is
          goodbye. Thanks for helping me out.

Olivia gives Antonio a warm hug.


INT. TOYOTA YARIS - CONTINUOUS

Stegman, parked down the street, on the phone:

                    STEGMAN
          I’m looking at them right now,
          ma’am -- they’re a couple.


EXT. BRENTWOOD MANSION, TENNIS COURT - INTERCUT

Kathryn talks on her cell. Behind her, three other westside
ladies warm up for Pickleball.

                    KATHRYN
          She really spent the night? In the
          barrio?

Blanca arrives with a tray of iced tea and a bowl of
cherries. Kathryn hands her the MINI-RECORDER and whispers:

                    KATHRYN (CONT'D)
          Just a few things.

                    STEGMAN
          I don’t think they really use that
          word anymore, but yeah, they
          shacked up.

Kathryn smiles -- relieved her marriage is intact.

                    KATHRYN (O.S.)
          I can’t believe the bastard...


INT. PEREZ’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Perez munches on a burrito while he LISTENS to the AUDIO BUG.

                    KATHRYN (O.S.)
          ...was actually telling the truth.
                                                 69.


                    STEGMAN (O.S.)
          Sometimes they do. Not often. But
          sometimes. I’ll send an invoice.


INT. ROYCE TOWER, ELEVATOR - SAME TIME

George hits the button. Daniel slips in before the door
closes. As they go up:

                    DANIEL
          A few shareholders are resisting the
          buyout. I’m going to need more time.

                    GEORGE
          Doesn’t matter. I’ve decided not to
          divorce Kathryn.

                    DANIEL
          Really? Why the change of heart?

                    GEORGE
          I couldn’t sleep last night. I
          poured myself a scotch and did some
          soul searching. What kind of man do
          I want to be? And then I realized --
          rich. Rich and powerful is the kind
          of man I want to be.

                    DANIEL
          I admire your honesty.

The doors open...


INT. ROYCE TOWER, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

They walk and talk, passing a JANITOR emptying trash cans.

                    GEORGE
          What was I thinking? Juggling two
          women at a premiere like I’m
          Leonardo DiCaprio. When I was in
          business school I dreamed of one
          thing -- becoming a CEO of a vast
          real estate empire. Why would I
          risk that for what might be a
          passing fancy?


INT. ROYCE TOWER, GEORGE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

They head in.
                                                70.


                    GEORGE
          Sure, Olivia’s intoxicating now,
          but who knows how I’ll feel in a
          few months?

Daniel’s phone RINGS. He looks at the caller ID.

                    DANIEL
          It’s Perez.

George grabs the phone.

                    GEORGE
          What do you got?... Spectacular.
              (to Daniel)
          Kathryn called off the dogs.

                    DANIEL
          Congratulations. You got away scot-
          free.

                    GEORGE
              (into phone)
          Out of curiosity, what was the
          turning point?... What?!
              (to Daniel)
          She spent the night with him! That
          dirty little homunculus.

                    DANIEL
          Important thing is your empire’s
          still intact.

                    GEORGE
          No one asked you.
              (into phone)
          Perez, listen to me. Hire a second
          detective. I want someone following
          her. I want someone following him.
          Full saturation coverage.

                    DANIEL
          But you’ve moved on. Why would you
          do that?

                    GEORGE
          I love that woman. The valet messed
          with the wrong hombre.

                                                   CUT TO:

EXT. KOBRA, VALET STAND - DAY

The VALETS hang out between runs.
                                                 71.


                    BENNY
          It’s eating at me. Are you some
          kind of sex god, Antonio?

                    ANTONIO
          I’m not a sex god.

                    BENNY
          I had a dog when I was a kid -- he
          gave off a scent or something, made
          the girl dogs crazy. Maybe you got
          something like that.

Javier notices the stunning ITALIAN MODEL from the premiere
leaving with some friends.

                    JAVIER
          Hey, know that billboard on Doheny?

                    RUDY
          The hottie with the fur boots?

                    JAVIER
          I think that’s her.

As they sneak a look, the Model strolls over to Antonio,
slips him her card, and whispers in his ear:

                    ITALIAN MODEL
          If things don’t work out with
          Olivia, give me a call.

She gives him a kiss on the cheek and walks off, leaving the
valets’ minds blown once again. Benny turns to Antonio:

                    BENNY
          Okay, you and me -- in the bathroom.
          Right now. I got to see it.


INT. RANCHO PARK DRIVING RANGE - DAY

Stegman shanks a drive.

                    MAN (O.S.)
          Still dropping your elbow.

He turns to see Perez.

                    PEREZ
          Hear you might be looking for a job.

                    STEGMAN
          Son of a bitch. You had me bugged.
                                                72.


                    PEREZ
          You want a paycheck or not?


INT. OLIVIA'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Olivia, excited, sits at her computer, on the phone.

                    OLIVIA
          They loved the movie! Did you see
          the reviews?


INT. RESTAURANT - INTERCUT

CLOSE ON -- Amanda on the phone.

                    AMANDA
          I thought you never read them.

                    OLIVIA
          Of course I read them. I’m not a
          crazy person. New York Times.
          “Earhart Soars!” Variety. “A
          Triumph.” And those are just the
          ones I’ve memorized.

                    AMANDA
          Um, that’s awesome. But right now
          I’m with my mom. It’s her birthday.

REVEAL Amanda’s with her family at Benihana’s as the CHEF
lights the FLAMING VOLCANO. They all clap and cheer.

                    OLIVIA
          Okay, have fun. The whole office is
          drinking champagne on Monday.
              (then, realizing)
          You’ll need to pick up champagne.
          Three bottles. Maybe four.

She dances around the room, dialing her phone as she sings:

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          They love my movie, they love my
          movie...
              (then, into phone)
          They love my movie!


INT. AIRPLANE, FIRST CLASS - INTERCUT

Jennifer, the publicist, on her phone, waits to take off.
                                                73.


                    JENNIFER
          How great were those reviews?!

                    OLIVIA
          Except for Liz Pembrooke of the
          Chicago Sun Times. I wonder how
          she’d feel hearing that her
          sexuality seems forced. But I’m not
          gonna dwell on that. She always
          hates me. Let’s go drink too much!

                    JENNIFER
          I wish. On my way to Miami. My
          sister’s getting married. Again.
          But I’m taking you for margaritas
          as soon as I get back.

                    OLIVIA
          Okay. Great.

She hangs up. She dances, a little less enthusiastically this
time, and scrolls through her phone again, singing:

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          They love my movie, who should I
          call, who should I call...


INT. BRENTWOOD MANSION - LATER

George and Kathryn host a small cocktail party. George holds
court with the other rich and powerful:

                    GEORGE
          ...and there’s some woman with a
          bike shop firing up the natives.
          Honestly, I don’t know how
          gentrification got to be such a bad
          word. I mean, who doesn’t want a
          SoulCycle in their neighborhood?

George’s phone RINGS. He checks the caller ID -- “DENTIST.”

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Excuse me. Scheduling issues.

He steps outside...


EXT. BRENTWOOD MANSION, TERRACE - CONTINUOUS

...to a quiet corner to answer:
                                                 74.


                    GEORGE
          I’m at home! Are you nuts?!


INT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - INTERCUT (N5)

Olivia on the phone.

                    OLIVIA
          My movie’s a big hit. I talked to
          my agent -- there’re three more
          bidders for my company. It’s all
          happening. Everything we dreamed
          of.

                    GEORGE
          Where were you last night?

                    OLIVIA
          What?! I want to be with you. I
          want to celebrate with the man I
          love.

                    GEORGE
          You heard me. Where were you?

He notices Blanca hovering nearby. He quickly cups the phone:

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Blanca, what is it?

                    BLANCA
          Mrs. Royce says time for your toast.

                    GEORGE
              (into the phone)
          I gotta go.

He hangs up. Olivia sighs, disappointed:

                    OLIVIA
          They love my movie.


EXT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

She’s ALL ALONE in her beautiful, lit-up, glass box. Only the
sound of crickets, and oddly, Golf Talk on Sirius radio.

PULL BACK to REVEAL Stegman watching from his parked car.
                                               75.


INT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Olivia, feeling sorry for herself, grabs wine from the
fridge. She closes the door, but stops when she sees --

The Pan Dulce CARE PACKAGE from Antonio’s family.

She smiles to herself, wistful.


INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATER

In the THEATER/GYM, a mix of mostly Latinx and Korean high-
school kids gamely put on “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”

                    MARCO (AS LYSANDER)
          “One heart, one bed, two bosoms,
          and one troth.”

                    SOFIA (AS HERMIA)
          “Nay, good Lysander; for my sake,
          my dear. Lie further off yet; do
          not lie so near.”

IN THE AUDIENCE, Antonio watches with Clara, Benny, Cecilia,
and Mr. Kim.

                    MARCO (AS LYSANDER)
          “O, take the sense, sweet, of my
          innocence!”

Antonio smiles -- proud of his boy. He turns to share the
moment with Isabel across the aisle, but--

RANDY THE REALTOR (45, strong chin, lotta linen), sitting
next to her, notices Antonio and gives him his SIGNATURE
FINGER GUNS, killing his mood.

FROM A SIDE DOOR, Olivia slips in, dressed casually with her
hair pulled back.

Clara excitedly waves her over, scooting everyone down to
make room. As Olivia sits next to Antonio:

                    OLIVIA
          Hope it’s okay I came.

                    ANTONIO
          Marco’s gonna be so happy.

Isabel, distracted by Olivia, barely watches the play.

IN A BACK ROW, Stegman squeezes down the aisle and sits next
to Perez, who offers him a Starburst and whispers:
                                                  76.


                    PEREZ
          The king’s overacting, but the
          donkey’s hilarious.


INT. PIZZA PLACE, COURTYARD - LATER

The CAST PARTY. A charming PATIO with twinkling lights. A DJ
plays music for a multi-generational crowd. Marco pumps
Olivia for feedback as his family looks on.

                    MARCO
          You’re not just saying that ‘cause
          you have to?

                    OLIVIA
          No, you completely became the
          character. When you got back with
          Hermia...

                    CLARA
          Who’s adorable, by the way.

                     OLIVIA
          ...I got choked up.
              (then)
          Can I get you to sign my program?

                     MARCO
          I know you’re just being nice, but
          hell yeah.

As Marco grabs a pen and writes an inscription:

                    BENNY
          It was good. It was long -- but it
          was good.

                    ANTONIO
          I still can’t believe you got up in
          front of all those people. My son...
              (tapping his heart)
          ...I’m so proud.

                    MARCO
          Okay, we get it. You’re my dad. You
          think I’m great.
              (getting up)
          I need to go give Mom equal time.

Antonio watches Marco walk over to Isabel where Randy
balances a spoon on his nose to the delight of everyone at
the table. As Antonio’s heart sinks, Clara turns to Olivia.
                                                 77.


                    CLARA
          I got to ask. What do you see in my
          brother?

                    BENNY
          Elephant in the room, right there.

                    OLIVIA
          Um, well... that’s a tough
          question. What do you see in Benny?

                    CLARA
          I don’t remember.

Cecilia laughs.

                    BENNY
          What’re you laughing at? You don’t
          even speak English.

                    ANTONIO
          Can we just change the subject?

                    OLIVIA
          No, I want to answer. Obviously
          he’s handsome.

                    ANTONIO
          Please continue.

                    OLIVIA
          But what makes your brother
          special... is...

She stops for a moment to really look at him.

                     OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          ...he’s decent. And kind. And he’s
          not pretending to be someone he’s
          not.
               (smiling at Antonio)
          I admire that.

They all take this in, then:

                    BENNY
          We’re the last of a dying breed.

Mr. Kim whispers in Korean to his 25 year-old GRANDDAUGHTER.

                    GRANDDAUGHTER
          My grandfather would like to thank
          you for including us in this festive
          occasion.
                    (MORE)
                                                 78.

                    GRANDDAUGHTER (CONT'D)
          And though he did not understand any
          of the words, he thought the
          production was top-notch.

Mr. Kim whispers some more.

                    GRANDDAUGHTER (CONT'D)
          He’d also like to tell Cecilia she
          looks especially beautiful tonight.

Antonio turns to his mother:

                    ANTONIO
          He liked the play and says you’re
          pretty. Anything you want to say to
          Mr. Kim? Now’s your chance.

                    CECILIA
          Tell him he doesn’t have to be so
          gentle. I would like it if he
          pulled my hair once in a while.

                    ANTONIO
          She says he looks very handsome, as
          well.

As Clara stifles a laugh, BLANCA approaches:

                    BLANCA
          Antonio, our children were amazing!
              (turns to Olivia)
          That was just an excuse to meet you.

                    ANTONIO
          This is Blanca. Hermia’s mom.

                    OLIVIA
          Oh my God, she’s a natural. You must
          be so proud. Sit down, join us.

                    BLANCA
          I don’t want to intrude, but could
          I get a picture?

                    OLIVIA
          Let’s do it.

Olivia stands and puts her arm around Blanca who waves her
entire family over. Four generations of Guatemalans gather
for a group shot as Antonio snaps photos.

                    BLANCA
          My church group’s gonna shit
          themselves when I post these.
                                                79.


The DJ cues a rockin’ old-school MEXICAN CUMBIA.

                    DJ
          Here’s one for the parents.

Cecilia starts to drag Mr. Kim on to the dance floor.

                    ANTONIO
          Mom, try not to overexert yourself
          -- your heart.

                    CECILIA
          Try not to be such a wet blanket.

As Benny and Clara join them, Benny offers his hand to Olivia.

                    BENNY
          You’re coming too -- let’s see what
          you got.

                     OLIVIA
          A lot less than you think.
              (then)
          Really nice meeting you, Blanca.

As they all head off, Blanca whispers to Antonio:

                    BLANCA
          You’re girlfriend’s very sweet.

She WINKS at Antonio.

                    ANTONIO
          Did you just wink at me?

                    BLANCA
          I work for Mr. Royce. I do his
          laundry. You learn things.

                    ANTONIO
          Please don’t tell anyone.

                     BLANCA
          Your secret’s safe.
              (then)
          She deserves way better.

ON THE DANCE FLOOR, Olivia gets down with Benny, Clara,
Cecilia, Mr. Kim as well as Marco and Sofia.

                    BLANCA (CONT'D)
          I think my daughter has the hots
          for your son.
                                                80.


                    ANTONIO
          I think it’s very mutual.


INT. PIZZA PLACE, COURTYARD - LATER

AT THE BAR, Natalie pays for a round as Antonio steps up with
the empty pitcher.

                    ANTONIO
          Natalie, what’re you doing here?

                    NATALIE
          Bunch of us were out canvasing --
          we’re having another demonstration
          tomorrow. Whatever we can do before
          the council meeting.

                    ANTONIO
          How’s it looking?

                    NATALIE
          Not good, that’s why we’re here --
          tequila therapy.

She downs a shot.

                    NATALIE (CONT'D)
          Know what I’m going to miss most?
          Customers like you.

                    ANTONIO
          Hey -- your Spanish.

                    NATALIE
          It’s better when I drink.

She kisses him on the cheek and heads off. ACROSS THE BAR,
Benny, having witnessed this, bows to the master.


EXT. PIZZA PLACE - LATER

The green Yaris idles in the loading zone across the street.

                    STEGMAN (O.S.)
          So, you ever remarry?


INT. STEGMAN’S CAR - SAME TIME

Perez and Stegman eat pizza, keeping an eye on the party.
                                                 81.


                    PEREZ
          Twice. And both times it was gonna
          be different. You?

                    STEGMAN
          Three times. World’s most expensive
          hat trick. Right now, I’m living at
          my brother’s.

                    PEREZ
          Got your own room?

                    STEGMAN
          The seven year-old’s trundle.
          SpongeBob blanket.

                    PEREZ
          I’ve slept on worse.


INT. PIZZA PLACE, QUIET HALLWAY - LATER

Antonio steps out of the restroom. Isabel appears out of
nowhere and pins him against the wall.

                    ISABEL
          I can’t stop thinking about you!

She KISSES him.

                    ANTONIO
          What about Randy?

                    ISABEL
          Randy’s a buffoon. How serious are
          you and Olivia? Do I have a chance?

                    ANTONIO
          Yes. Very much.

                    ISABEL
          You’d leave a famous actress for me?

                    ANTONIO
          I’m not supposed to tell anyone,
          but we’re not really dating.

                    ISABEL
          What?

                    ANTONIO
          It’s all pretend. Olivia’s having
          an affair with some billionaire.
                                                 82.


                    ISABEL
          You’re not a couple?

                    ANTONIO
          No. The whole thing’s made up so no
          one finds out.

                    ISABEL
          You were never a couple?

                    ANTONIO
          No. The guy’s lawyer shows up and
          offers me money and then the guy’s
          wife offers me even more money.

                    ISABEL
          How much more?

                    ANTONIO
          A hundred thousand dollars. Rich
          people -- they’re crazy.

                    ISABEL
          You got a hundred thousand dollars?!

                    ANTONIO
          No, I already gave my word to the
          other guy. But here’s the best part,
          I was gonna surprise you with--

                    RANDY (O.S.)
          Hey -- anyone seen my lady?

                    ISABEL
          Shit, Randy! I’ll call you later.

She gives him one last kiss and runs off.


INT. PIZZA PLACE, COURTYARD - LATER

Antonio, smiling big, returns to the party. Marco approaches.

                    MARCO
          I’m walking Sofia home. Mom knows.
              (off Antonio’s grin)
          Don’t be weird.

Marco rushes off, Antonio sits at the table next to Benny.

                    BENNY
          Check out the old folks.
                                               83.


On the DANCE FLOOR Cecilia slow dances with Mr. Kim, in love.
Antonio watches, touched by how happy his mom seems.

                    BENNY (CONT'D)
          I can’t remember the last time I
          danced with your sister like that.

Clara overhears as she walks by:

                    CLARA
          Your cousin’s wedding. 2004.

                    BENNY
          Under duress.
              (then, to Antonio)
          So listen, I’m putting in a bid to
          take over the parking at Vine
          Street Grill.

                    ANTONIO
          How many restaurants would that
          make? Four? You’re a big shot.

                    BENNY
          Not breaking out the good scotch
          yet -- still haggling over garage
          fees -- but if it works out, I
          thought you could be my guy on the
          ground. Create some kind of
          management position.

                    ANTONIO
          You want to promote me?

                    BENNY
          Obviously I underestimated you.

Before he can respond, Olivia walks up.

                    OLIVIA
          I should get going. Walk me to my
          car?

                    BENNY
          You got some kind of magic sauce,
          Antonio -- mull it over.


INT. STEGMAN’S CAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Stegman hits Perez.

                      STEGMAN
          We’re up!
                                               84.


THEIR POV -- Olivia and Antonio step out of the restaurant.


EXT. PIZZA PLACE - CONTINUOUS

As Antonio unlocks his bike, Olivia spots Perez getting out
of the green Yaris and hurrying to his car.

                    OLIVIA
          I’m getting sick of these guys.

                    ANTONIO
          Wanna mess with them?

                    OLIVIA
          I do.

                    ANTONIO
          Hop on.

She sits behind him and holds on tightly as Antonio pedals
down Alvarado.

The two detectives follow in their cars at a safe distance --
a hot pursuit at eight miles an hour.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          Okay, now turn and wave.

She does, and Antonio makes a right between two buildings.

The detectives pull up to the spot -- no way their cars can
fit through the tight passageway.


INT. STEGMAN’S CAR / INT. PEREZ’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Both on speaker:

                    PEREZ
          Shit. Where does it lead?

                    STEGMAN
          Probably empties out on Westlake.

                    PEREZ
          Let’s cut through the Pep Boys.

But before they can drive off --


EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Antonio and Olivia cruise by, smiling.
                                               85.


                    ANTONIO
          Vete a freir pinas!

                    OLIVIA
          What does that mean?

Perez and Stegman follow.

                    ANTONIO
          Technically, “Go fry pineapples.”
          But really it’s just a fun way to
          say, “Go fuck yourself.”

                    OLIVIA
              (laughing)
          Yeah, go fuck some pineapples!

Antonio takes a left into an ALLEY. So do the detectives --
only to find a DEAD END. Antonio and Olivia slip though a
pedestrian walkway.


INT. STEGMAN’S CAR / INT. PEREZ’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

                    STEGMAN
          Reverse! Reverse!


EXT. STREET - INTERCUT

Perez pulls out onto the boulevard, Stegman right behind.

                    STEGMAN
          Should we split up?

                     PEREZ
          No.

                     STEGMAN
          Why not?

                    PEREZ
          ‘Cause here they come again.

THRU THE WINDSHIELD, Antonio and Olivia pedal down the middle
of the street towards them. As they ride by:

                    ANTONIO
          Last time, we promise.

                    OLIVIA
          Vete a freir pinas!
                                                86.


Antonio turns off the street, steers down a small grass
embankment and they disappear into the night, laughing.


EXT. MACARTHUR PARK - LATER

Antonio buys paletas (popsicles) from a CART VENDOR and hands
one to Olivia. As they walk:

                    OLIVIA
          You know I’ve lived in LA since I
          was sixteen and I’ve never been
          here. It’s beautiful.

                    ANTONIO
          Don’t go on the other side of the
          lake. That’s where the junkies are.

                    OLIVIA
          I feel like people don’t recognize
          me here.

                     ANTONIO
          No one expects to see a famous
          actress in MacArthur Park eating
          Mexican popsicles -- you got the
          night off.

                    OLIVIA
          It’s kinda nice being invisible.

                    ANTONIO
          It gets old.

They find an empty bench on a hill.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          Guess what? Isabel wants me back.

                    OLIVIA
          I’m not gonna say I told you so,
          but... I told you. So.

                    ANTONIO
          I’m really happy.

They watch the park life -- soccer, parties, children,
parents, grandparents -- a Latinx BAND plays a free concert.

                    OLIVIA
          It’s pretty late, right? Don’t
          these kids have a bedtime?
                                                   87.


                       ANTONIO
             It’s only 10:30. Gringos take their
             sleep way too seriously.

                       OLIVIA
             I used to come with my parents to a
             park like this every Fourth of
             July. Before they got divorced.
             Those are some of my best memories
             and I was still in bed by eight.

He laughs.

                       ANTONIO
             Where’d you grow up?

                       OLIVIA
             Bakersfield. Gateway to Fresno.

                       ANTONIO
             It’s nice your family’s close by.

                       OLIVIA
             My dad disappeared and I haven’t
             talked to my mom in twenty years.

                       ANTONIO
             Twenty years? That’s impossible.

                        OLIVIA
             She did some really shitty things
             when I got famous.
                 (then)
             Heard she finally got sober. She’s
             called a few times. Left some
             messages, trying to apologize. The
             sick thing -- she’d be proud I’m
             starting a company, but... I just
             can’t.

                       ANTONIO
             I have an aunt who stabbed my
             uncle. Still comes over every
             Christmas. She sits right next to
             him. With a big scar on his neck.

She laughs, then notices:

                       OLIVIA
             Is that your son making-out with
             Hermia?

ACROSS THE FIELD, Marco and Sofia kiss by the fountain.
                                                  88.


                    ANTONIO
          I don’t want to stop it. But I
          don’t want to watch it either.
              (standing)
          Let’s get out of here.


EXT. ALVARADO STREET - LATER

Antonio, pushing his bike, walks Olivia to her car -- even
late at night, the street’s alive.

                       OLIVIA
          Seventeen?

                    ANTONIO
          My mom sent us to live with my Aunt -
          - you really want to hear this?

                       OLIVIA
          Yes.

                    ANTONIO
          Clara was only nine and I had to
          help out. So I started busing
          tables and working construction.
          Those guys you see outside Home
          Depot? That was me.

                    OLIVIA
          I feel like I should’ve paid for
          the popsicles.

                    ANTONIO
          When I finally got a steady job as
          a valet, I thought I was living the
          life. And I was able to help put
          Clara through college.
              (proud)
          She’s a school principal now.

                    OLIVIA
          She must be so grateful.

                    ANTONIO
          If she is, she keeps it to herself.

They get to Olivia’s Range Rover.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          This is you, right?

Olivia beeps her car open, then:
                                                89.


                    OLIVIA
          Actually, I don’t feel like being
          alone tonight. Is it okay if I stay
          at your place?

                    ANTONIO
          Sure, but you get the chair this
          time.

He gets on his bike.

                    OLIVIA
          That’s fair.

She hops on the back and they cruise down the hill.

                    ANTONIO
          You know I’m gonna insist you take
          the bed.

                    OLIVIA
          I was counting on it.


INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - LATER

Cecilia holds a cigarette out the window. Hearing the key in
the door, she puts it out, trying to usher the SMOKE outside.

Antonio and Olivia enter.

                    ANTONIO
          Mom, you promised--

                    CECILIA
          I wasn’t smoking! But there’re some
          men over there spying on me. Did
          you hire thugs to catch me smoking?

                    ANTONIO
          So you were smoking?

                    CECILIA
          I allow myself one before bed. It
          relaxes me. Are you going to rob an
          old lady of a little pleasure?!

Cecilia heads to her bedroom:

                    CECILIA (CONT'D)
          Now I’m gonna need another.
                                                90.


                    ANTONIO
          The detectives are watching us from
          that apartment.

He closes the curtains, then starts towards his room.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          I’ll close them in the bedroom too.

                    OLIVIA
          No. If George wants to see what’s
          happening in the bedroom, let’s
          show him what’s happening in the
          bedroom.

                    ANTONIO
          What’s happening in the bedroom?

                    OLIVIA
          We’re gonna make him jealous.
              (off his nervous look)
          Relax. I’ve had a lot of fake sex
          in the movies. And not in the
          movies.


INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Perez and Stegman have set up SURVEILANCE EQUIPMENT -- along
with lawn chairs, a cooler, and a hibachi -- across from
Antonio’s apartment.

                    STEGMAN
          I’m still confused -- who put the
          spell on Lysander?

                    PEREZ
          Puck, but it doesn’t matter. I
          think what Shakespeare’s saying is
          we can’t help ourselves -- we fall
          in love with the wrong people.
              (glances out the window)
          Oh, boy. Client ain’t gonna like this.

He grabs his camera and starts filming.

STEGMAN’S POV -- Olivia and Antonio burst into the bedroom,
“kissing” and tossing off clothing. Olivia, down to her bra
and underwear, pushes Antonio, in boxers, onto the bed.
                                                91.


INT. ANTONIO’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Antonio on his back, watches transfixed -- with fear and
astonishment -- as Olivia climbs on top and “straddles” him.

                    ANTONIO
          I’m starting to feel uncomfortable.

                    OLIVIA
          It’s okay, I don’t need you anymore
          -- you’re below the frame.


INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

PEREZ and STEGMAN’S POV -- in the OPEN WINDOW across the way,
all they see is Olivia from the waist up, having what appears
to be hot, sweaty sex with Antonio (who can’t be seen).


INT. ANTONIO’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

As Olivia continues to writhe in “ecstasy:”

                    ANTONIO
          So I can leave?

                    OLIVIA
          Just stay under the windowsill.

Antonio shimmies out from under her and rolls off the bed,
making sure to keep his body very low.

As he army-crawls towards door, Olivia ups the ante, and
calls out “passionately” for the detectives’ benefit:

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Antonio! Antonio!

                    ANTONIO
          What?

                    OLIVIA
              (whispering)
          I’m acting.
              (then, loudly)
          I’m so turned on right now!


INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Perez and Stegman watch Olivia bounce up and down.
                                                92.


                    OLIVIA
          Grab my ass, big boy!

                    PEREZ
          What’s that guy have that I don’t?

                       STEGMAN
          A lot.


INT. APARTMENT, ANOTHER UNIT - CONTINUOUS

A TEENAGED BOY wearing a headset plays Fortnite on-line.

                    TEENAGED BOY
          Liam?! Behind you! Behind you!

He looks up and sees the half-naked Olivia.

                       TEENAGED BOY (CONT'D)
          Take over.

He drops his joystick and crosses to the window for a better
view.


INT. ANTONIO'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

With Olivia nearing “orgasm” in the other room, Antonio fixes
himself a bowl of cereal.

                    OLIVIA (O.S.)
          Oh God, Antonio! I’m coming!
          Antonio, yes! Yes! Yes!

Cecilia walks in to get some water.

                    CECILIA
          I’m not gonna ask.


INT. ANTONIO’S BEDROOM - LATER

Olivia, now in Antonio’s pajamas, lies in bed. Antonio tries
to get comfortable on the Barcalounger.

                    ANTONIO
          I still don’t really get why’re you
          doing all this?

                    OLIVIA
          A lot of reasons. None of them make
          much sense at the moment.
                                                93.


Olivia laughs to herself, but then... starts CRYING softly.

                       ANTONIO
          You okay?

Antonio sits on the bed next to her.

                    OLIVIA
          When I was a kid, I thought if I
          got famous, it would make
          everything better. And it did for a
          long time. It feels good when you
          think everyone loves you. But,
          really, they love this idea of you.
          I’ve got one of the most
          recognizable faces in the world,
          and I don’t feel like anyone really
          sees me. But I don’t want you to
          think I’m like a “poor little movie
          star.”

                    ANTONIO
          I don’t think that.

                    OLIVIA
          And you work all the time and
          everyone tells you what you want to
          hear. And you convince yourself
          you’ve got the perfect life
          everyone thinks you have. But I’ve
          never really had a decent, long-
          term relationship. I spent
          Thanksgiving at my assistant’s
          house. All my friends are people I
          pay. And if I’m honest, I doubt
          George’ll ever leave his wife.

                    ANTONIO
          He’d be crazy not to.

                    OLIVIA
          You’re a good guy.

She snuggles into him.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Why can’t I fall for someone like
          you?

                       ANTONIO
          I’m taken.

She smiles.
                                                94.


                    OLIVIA
          That’s my type.

Antonio starts to get up, but--

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          No, stay. Sleep next to me.

He slides under the covers.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Want to hear something funny?
          Olivia Allan isn’t even my real
          name. It’s Betsy Shevchuk.

                    ANTONIO
          It’s good you changed it.

She cuddles into him. Antonio’s EYES GO WIDE.

                    OLIVIA
          This is nice.

                    ANTONIO
          A little too nice. Let’s sleep back
          to back.

He rolls over.


EXT. PICO-UNION - THE NEXT MORNING

As the sun rises over the neighborhood, Perez bounds up the
steps of the STAKEOUT APARTMENT BUILDING with a TO-GO BAG.


INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Stegman reclines in a lawn chair. Perez bursts in.

                    PEREZ
          I made us three hundred bucks.
          Tipped off the paparazzi.
          Questionable ethics, I know, but
          today we eat like kings.


INT. ANTONIO’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Olivia sleeps peacefully. Antonio, sleeps next to her, a safe
distance away. He wakes when he gets a TEXT from Isabel: “U
up? Need to see you.” He texts back: “How about now?”

Excited, he quickly starts to put on his clothes.
                                                95.


                    OLIVIA
          Where’re you going?

                    ANTONIO
          I’m meeting Isabel. Go back to bed.
          Coffee’s above the fridge.

He grabs his shoes and rushes out.


EXT. PICO-UNION - LATER

Antonio, all smiles, pedals down Union, as shop owners open
up for the day.

                    ISABEL (O.S.)
          I couldn’t sleep last night.


INT. LOCAL BAKERY - LATER

Antonio and Isabel drink coffee.

                    ANTONIO
          Me either. My mind was racing.

                    ISABEL
          This is really hard for me, but I
          thought about it and thought about
          it... this is never going to be
          what I need.

                    ANTONIO
          What’re you saying?

                    ISABEL
          It’s been nine months. It’s time we
          got a divorce.

                    ANTONIO
          You kissed me last night.

                    ISABEL
          I can’t stop thinking about how you
          turned down all that money.
          Antonio, you go through life acting
          like you don’t deserve much. How do
          you think that makes me feel? I
          want to be with someone who thinks
          they deserve the best of
          everything.

                    ANTONIO
          You said you loved me.
                                                 96.


                    ISABEL
          I did... I do... but we met when we
          were young. We’re different people
          now. I’m sorry.

                    ANTONIO
          But--

                    ISABEL
          My friend’s sister is a lawyer --
          she said she’d do the paperwork.

He falls back in his chair, devastated.

                    ISABEL (CONT'D)
          The good thing about not having much
          is there’s not much to fight over.


INT. ROYCE TOWER, GEORGE’S OFFICE - LATER

George admires an intricate MODEL of the Pico-Union project
with Daniel and the ARCHITECTS.

                    GEORGE
          A work of art, people. Bravo.

Daniel’s phone BUZZES.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Is that Perez?

Daniel looks at the text -- it’s a video from Olivia and
Antonio’s fake sex show.

                    DANIEL
          More important matters at hand.

                    GEORGE
          Don’t treat me like a child.

He GRABS THE PHONE and HITS PLAY and watches.

                    OLIVIA (O.S.)
          Grab my ass, big boy!

Daniel braces for an outburst, but George remains oddly calm:

                    GEORGE
          Okay. I see. Good to know.

He hands the phone back, then turns back to the model:
                                               97.


                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I feel like this tree wants to be
          over here. Do you mind?

The architects look on nervously, as George gently moves the
tiny, 3D Eucalyptus a quarter inch. He steps back:

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          No, a little further.
              (adjusting it)
          Little further still.
              (moving it again)
          There. Perfect.

But then -- he starts PUMMELLING the model with his fists.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          That wily son of bitch!


EXT. PICO-UNION - LATER

A miserable Antonio bikes up to his apartment where several
papparazzi wait out front. As they snap photos:

                    PAPPARAZZI #7
          Antonio! How’s it going, buddy?

                    ANTONIO
          Not in the mood, Tom.

He hops off his bike. As he hoists it on his shoulder, he
sees Mr. Kim and a tenant carrying a heavy table upstairs.

Frustrated, Antonio quickly locks his bike on the side of the
building.


INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE ON -- A MOVIE ON TV. Olivia and a handsome actor stroll
along the beach, their DIALOGUE DUBBED.

REVEAL Cecilia and Olivia watching on the couch, like it’s
the most normal thing in the world.

                    OLIVIA
          I think I’m more attractive in
          Spanish.

The door opens, and Antonio storms in.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          How did it go?
                                                 98.


                       ANTONIO
          Not great.

He crosses into his room...


INT. ANTONIO’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

...and changes into his valet uniform. Olivia follows.

                    OLIVIA
          What happened?

                    ANTONIO
          Isabel wants a divorce.

                       OLIVIA
          What? Why?

                    ANTONIO
          She was only interested because I
          was with you. When she found out I
          wasn’t, it was adios Antonio.

                    OLIVIA
          I’m really sorry.

                    ANTONIO
          Yeah. Me too.

Antonio, followed by Olivia, crosses out.


INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

He opens the fridge and throws together a lunch.

                    OLIVIA
          Did she give you any other reason?

                    ANTONIO
          She doesn’t want to be with a valet.
          She has bigger plans than me.

                    OLIVIA
          She said that?

                    ANTONIO
          She’s been saying that one way or
          the other for years.

                    OLIVIA
          Then maybe she doesn’t deserve you.
                                               99.


He loads up his lunchbox, including a few condiment packets
from Arby’s:

                    ANTONIO
          I take mustard from restaurants so
          I don’t have to pay for a whole
          jar. Yeah, I’m a real catch.

                    OLIVIA
          I have a drawer full of soy sauce
          packets.

                    ANTONIO
          I don’t want to talk about it.

                    CECILIA
          Antonio, if you mess this up, I’m
          choosing her.

                    ANTONIO
          Stay out of this, Mom!

                    OLIVIA
          Why don’t you want to talk about
          it?

                    ANTONIO
          ‘Cause I don’t, okay?

                    OLIVIA
          You’re a wonderful guy. You should
          be with someone who sees that.

                    ANTONIO
          How can you say that with a
          straight face?

                    OLIVIA
          What does that mean?

                     ANTONIO
          Nothing.

                    OLIVIA
          No, I want to know.

                    ANTONIO
          You can have any man in the world
          and you pick one that’s married?

                    OLIVIA
          That’s not fair. I didn’t know he
          was married when we met.
                                                100.


                    ANTONIO
          You ever think maybe you don’t want
          a relationship? That maybe you like
          being alone. Maybe you don’t want
          anyone to really know you.

                    OLIVIA
          That’s ridiculous.

                    ANTONIO
          You don’t even talk to your own
          mother. I share a bathroom with
          mine. And she’s not shy!

                    OLIVIA
          How did this become about me? This
          is about you.

                    ANTONIO
          You don’t know anything about me.

He storms outside...


EXT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Antonio heads downstairs, Olivia close on his heels.

                    OLIVIA
          What’re you talking about? I’m your
          friend.

                    ANTONIO
          Really? We’re friends?

                       OLIVIA
          Of course.

                    ANTONIO
          Come on -- you’re gonna go back to
          your movie star life and I’m gonna
          go back to being invisible to you.

                    OLIVIA
          That’s not true.

                    ANTONIO
          So you’re gonna call me and we’re
          gonna go out for lunch?

                    OLIVIA
          I don’t know. Maybe. I don’t really
          do that with anyone.
                                                101.


                    ANTONIO
          Yeah, that’s what I thought.

When they reach the sidewalk, the paparazzi snap pictures.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          Oh, look -- your real friends.

Antonio yells to the paparazzi:

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          Get them while you can, guys. We’re
          breaking up. It’s over.

                       OLIVIA
          Antonio...

                    ANTONIO
              (angry)
          What?

                       OLIVIA
          Forget it.

Disappointed, she heads down the street to her car. The
paparazzi have a choice -- Olivia or Antonio? Without
hesitation, they follow Olivia...

...leaving Antonio ALONE on the sidewalk.

He watches them disappear down the block, then turns to get
his bike -- only to discover it’s been STOLEN. All that
remains is the FRONT WHEEL locked to the fence.

                       ANTONIO
          Perfect.

A Jaguar SCREECHES to the curb. George stumbles out of the
back, disheveled and drunk, and marches over to Antonio.

                    GEORGE
          I didn’t hire you to screw my
          girlfriend, you greasy tomcat!

George PUNCHES him. As Antonio stumbles into the fence,
George grimaces in pain, grabbing his hand.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Wow. That really hurt. Way more
          than I expected.

In the back of the car, Daniel watches his boss with disdain.
                                               102.


                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I’m not paying you a cent!

George climbs in and they drive off.


EXT. BUS STOP - LATER

Forlorn, Antonio sits on the bench, with a SWOLLEN EYE,
holding the bike wheel. He looks over to see an ad for Randy
the Realtor, firing his trademark finger guns.

Antonio fires back with both middle fingers.


INT. BUS - MOMENTS LATER

Antonio walks down the aisle, searching for a seat among the
other “invisibles.”


EXT. PICO BOULEVARD - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON -- Antonio staring out the BUS WINDOW, a beaten man.

PULL BACK to REVEAL a poster for Olivia’s movie on the side
of the bus right underneath him.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. KOBRA, VALET STAND - LATER

Antonio brings Javier and Benny up to speed.

                    JAVIER
          It was all fake?

                    ANTONIO
          The whole thing.

                    BENNY
          You never had sex with her?

                    ANTONIO
          No.

                    BENNY
          Not even a...

He makes a “handjob” motion and whistles.

                    ANTONIO
          Nope.
                                                 103.


                    BENNY
          Don’t wanna delight in your misery,
          but the world makes sense again.

                    JAVIER
          Guey, you got to lay low. That
          billionaire’s gonna use his
          billionaire connections and get your
          brown ass deported back to Mexico.

                    ANTONIO
          I’m a U.S. citizen! I vote. I have
          a passport.

                    JAVIER
          Whatever. When you have to sneak
          back in, go through Texas.
          California and Arizona are way too
          hot right now.

A MERCEDES pulls to the curb. Daniel lowers the window:

                    DANIEL
          Mr. Flores -- you have a minute?

Javier looks at Daniel. Then at Antonio. Then back at Daniel.
Then... Javier SPRINTS away.


EXT. PARKING LOT / INT. MERCEDES - LATER

Parked in a quiet corner, Daniel talks to Antonio.

                    DANIEL
          My employer can be volatile, but
          you kept your side of the bargain.

He hands a CHECK to Antonio who unfolds it.

                    ANTONIO
          Twenty-five thousand dollars?
          That’s way more than we agreed to.

                    DANIEL
          He won’t notice.

                    ANTONIO
          I can’t accept this.

                    DANIEL
          I grew up not too far from you. My
          dad was the locker room attendant
          at the California Club. I know what
          this money can mean to you.
                                               104.


                     ANTONIO
          I don’t feel like I deserve--
               (then, catching himself)
          Actually, I will take it. Thank
          you.

                    DANIEL
          Thank you. In my job, I don’t get
          many opportunities to do the right
          thing.


INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - LATER

As Perez packs up his gear, Stegman looks out the window:

                    STEGMAN
          Look at these two. They just had
          sex. Now he’s making her eggs.

ACROSS THE WAY, Cecilia laughs as he flips the omlette with a
flourish.

                    STEGMAN (CONT'D)
          Swear to God -- never had a
          relationship that good.

                    PEREZ
          Listen, I got this two bedroom in
          the Marina. Has a view of the
          Jetty. Get you off your SpongeBob
          trundle.

                    STEGMAN
          Is that an offer?

                    PEREZ
          It’d be nice to have some company.
          And there’s a paddle tennis court.

                    STEGMAN
          Maybe we can get back in shape.
          Keep each other accountable.

As they seal the deal with a bro-hug, Stegman notices:

                    STEGMAN (CONT'D)
          Oh, shit. Call 911.

ACROSS THE WAY, Cecilia, clutching her chest, stumbles to the
ground.
                                                 105.


INT. CHURCH OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION - DAY

Light streams through the STAINED GLASS WINDOWS of this
ornate ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH as the organist plays Ave Maria.

The pallbearers -- Antonio, Marco, Benny, Javier, Rudy, and
Mr. Kim -- carry Cecilia’s casket to the altar.


EXT. BRENTWOOD MANSION - SAME TIME

Kathryn sits on the VERANDA, looking at international real
estate listings. She calls into the master bedroom:

                    KATHRYN
          George. You need to see this cute
          little apartment. It has a view of
          the Eiffel Tower.

She reaches into a bowl of cherries and pops one into her
mouth. Instantly, she grimaces, clutching her jaw.

                    KATHRYN (CONT'D)
          Ow.


INT. BRENTWOOD MANSION, DINNING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Kathryn waits at the table as George saunters in.

                    GEORGE
          Have you seen my phone?

She holds it up.

                     KATHRYN
          I called the “dentist.” Don’t
          worry, I hung up when I got her
          voicemail.

George turns ashen, then:

                    GEORGE
          Okay, it happened one time. Last
          May, on the Lawrence’s yacht. You
          were in Aspen at the Ideas
          Festival. We were fighting, it was
          my birthday, I was feeling old, I
          overdid the daiquiris, and she
          flattered me with her attention.
                                                 106.


INT. BRENTWOOD MANSION, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Blanca hides in the doorway, holding the MINI-RECORDER,
taping the conversation.

                    GEORGE (O.S.)
          I swear, she means nothing to me --
          she’s just a vain, insecure actress
          I wish I never met.


INT. CHURCH OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION - DAY

In the first three rows, Antonio’s family sits on one side,
including Isabel; on the other, Mr. Kim’s family. There are
also many people from the neighborhood.

The PRIEST finishes his prayer and nods to --

Antonio, sitting in the front row next to Clara, who gives
him a tearful hug.

Antonio makes his way to the pulpit. He looks out at the
crowd. Takes a deep breath.

                    ANTONIO
          I, um... I’m going to speak in
          English because I want Mr. Kim to
          understand everything.

Mr. Kim’s granddaughter TRANSLATES, whispering in his ear.
Mr. Kim looks up. He didn’t expect this.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          I’d be nervous in Spanish. I’m
          really nervous in English.

Antonio pulls out his notes.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          Cecilia Imelda Lopez Flores was
          born in Zacapala, Puebla -- a
          village so small, it didn’t appear
          on any maps.

IN THE PEWS, Clara lovingly puts her head on Benny’s
shoulder. Next to her, Dante and Luca watch funny videos on
their iPad, hidden in a prayer book.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          She had a tough childhood -- her
          father liked tequila and it got
          ugly sometimes -- so she ran away.
                    (MORE)
                                                107.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          She worked in the fields and when
          she made enough money she sent for
          her mother and sisters. She always
          said, “Change is good, though you
          don’t always know why when it
          happens.” That’s when she met my
          dad, who owned one of the fields.
          They had two kids by the time she
          was nineteen. And then my dad tried
          to break up a fight between some
          workers and died from a knife
          wound. She brought the whole family
          to Mexico City, trying to climb
          back up... and she sort of did. She
          got a job in a skyscraper as a
          cleaning lady. She could see the
          whole city from up there. “People
          go to college to have an office
          with this view,” she said, “I get
          twenty views like this every day.”
              (off the cuff)
          I guess we were alike that way. I
          get paid to drive fancy cars.

People laugh, including Isabel, who smiles warmly.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          Mama saved every penny she could to
          send Clara and me to the States.

Antonio stops, starting to choke up.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          She wanted a better life for us.

This is getting really hard for him.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          I found out later she never ate
          lunch at work to save that money.

He wipes tears from his face. Takes a deep breath and gathers
the strength to continue.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          She said she would follow us soon,
          but she was never going to leave
          her mother and Abuelita lived till
          ninety-one. Only then were we able
          to bring Mama to live with us. And
          that’s how she met Mr. Kim. He
          pretended to like her pozole. I can
          say this now, my mother was not a
          great cook.
                                               108.


Benny laughs. Antonio turns to Mr. Kim.

                     ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          Ha-Joon, I don’t know if she told
          you, but she only had two romances
          in her life. My dad -- and you.
          Thank you for bringing her so much
          happiness.

Mr. Kim nods his appreciation, fighting back tears.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          My mother didn’t live the kind of
          life that was going to get her
          picture in a magazine...

He looks around the church. At Clara. At Isabel. At Marco,
who taps his heart -- “I’m so proud of you, Dad.” Antonio
smiles -- maybe he’s talking about himself a little too.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          ...but she lived an extraordinary
          life. When she loved...


EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

Standing by the grave, family members take turns tossing
handfuls of dirt onto Cecilia’s casket.

                    ANTONIO (O.S.)
          ...she loved fully. When she
          hugged, she squeezed the life out
          of you. When she laughed, the
          ground shook.

Antonio lets the earth fall through his fingers.

                    ANTONIO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Goodbye, Mama. Te amo. Que
          descanses en paz.

Finally, Mr. Kim drops a single red rose. He turns to leave,
then, overcome with grief, tries to CLIMB INTO THE HOLE.
Benny and Antonio restrain him.


INT. ANTONIO'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

At the RECEPTION, family and friends mingle. Antonio passes
by Clara:

                    CLARA
          People brought too much food.
                                                109.


                    ANTONIO
          Way too much. The Koreans are even
          worse than the Mexicans.

Antonio sees Isabel by the buffet and walks over.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          I’m glad you came.

                    ISABEL
          I felt closer to your mom than my
          own.

                    ANTONIO
          I think she liked that.

                    ISABEL
          Can we talk outside?


EXT. ANTONIO'S APARTMENT, BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER

Antonio stands with Isabel.

                    ISABEL
          I know I’ve been all over the map
          and I feel really bad about the way
          I handled... everything.

                    ANTONIO
          There’s no easy way to end a
          marriage.

                    ISABEL
          That’s the thing... I don’t think I
          want to.

                    ANTONIO
          What’re you saying?

                    ISABEL
          You’re a good man. I started taking
          that for granted.

                    ANTONIO
          You want to stay married?

                    ISABEL
          Yes.

Antonio’s speechless as he takes in this information.

                    ISABEL (CONT'D)
          That’s what you want, right?
                                                110.


Beat, then:

                    ANTONIO
          I don’t think... I do anymore.

                    ISABEL
          Whoa, okay...

                    ANTONIO
          Isabel, I’ll always love you. But
          we don’t belong together.

                    ISABEL
          I thought--

                    ANTONIO
          I did. I guess what I realized --
          you don’t see me in the way I want
          to be seen.

She nods, taking this in. This strikes a cord with her.

                    ISABEL
          Antonio, I--

                    ANTONIO
          It’s okay. You were right. It’s
          time to move on.
              (re: funeral reception)
          Life’s short. Maybe it’s not too
          late for us to find our own Mr.
          Kims.

Isabel smiles. Antonio pulls a CHECK out of his pocket and
hands it to her.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          Here. So you can finish school.

                    ISABEL
          $12,850? You still want me to have
          this?

                    ANTONIO
          They actually gave me a little
          more. I’m gonna go in with Benny on
          a valet stand. I’m gonna be a boss.

                     ISABEL
          Good for you.
              (then)
          Well... I guess I should go.
                                                111.


                    ANTONIO
          Goodbye, Isabel.

                    ISABEL
          Goodbye, Antonio.

She kisses him on the cheek, then walks off. He watches, half
hoping she’ll turn around and fight for him. But she doesn’t.

After a moment, he heads back in...


INT. ANTONIO'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

...lingering near the door, not ready to join the party.

But then there’s a KNOCK. Antonio lights up -- maybe it’s
Isabel after all. He opens the door...

But it’s BLANCA, holding the mini-recorder.

                    BLANCA
          I think you need to hear this.


EXT. KOBRA, VALET STAND - DAY

Antonio, with the MINI-RECORDER, talks to his co-workers:

                    ANTONIO
          I feel like I should get this to
          her, but I don’t know where she
          lives. I don’t have her number. And
          she probably hates me anyway.

                    BENNY
          You said shitty things. I mean,
          she’s famous, but the woman has
          feelings.

                    JAVIER
          You know my opinion. Walk away.
          These people will eat you alive.

                    BENNY
          Wait, I know how to get it to her.
          She just started filming some new
          movie at Paramount. She told me
          while we were dancing.
              (to Javier and Rudy)
          That’s right, you assholes. We were
          dancing.

Benny shows off his best moves.
                                                  112.


                    RUDY
          It’s impossible to get on one of
          those lots. My uncle’s a gardener at
          Sony. He has to show them like five
          IDs just to mow the lawn.

A FERRARI pulls up. A GAY COUPLE steps out, the driver
tossing his blazer into the back seat.

                    ANTONIO
          I know how to get on.


EXT. PARAMOUNT PICTURES, MAIN GATE - LATER

The Ferrari pulls up to the kiosk. Antonio in the driver’s
seat, now wearing the blazer, rolls down his window:

                    ANTONIO
          Forgot my pass, bro.

The GUARD opens the gate and waves him through.


EXT. PARAMOUNT PICTURES, PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Antonio drives by the VALET STAND...

                    ANTONIO
          It’s okay -- I’ll park it myself.

...and expertly backs the car into a tight spot. The Valets
watch, impressed.

As Antonio hops out, his phone buzzes. He checks the text --
“On salads. U got an hour.”


INT./EXT. PARAMOUNT PICTURES, ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

As the crew sets up for the next scene, Olivia, dressed as a
waitress, sits in a booth, going over lines. She glances out
the window to see --

Antonio, across the street. He waves sheepishly.

Olivia, feeling a lot of different emotions, holds up a
finger, indicating she’ll be right out.

As if on cue, the crew picks up the DINER FACADE and carries
it off -- leaving a clear path. Olivia walks over.

                    ANTONIO
          Can we talk?
                                                113.


                    OLIVIA
          I’d like that.


INT. OLIVIA’S ON-SET TRAILER - LATER

Antonio hands Olivia the MINI-RECORDER.

                    ANTONIO
          You’re not gonna want to listen
          this, but...

                    OLIVIA
          Let me guess. He’s saying things
          that are gonna hurt my feelings?

                    ANTONIO
          Pretty much.

                    OLIVIA
          I don’t need to hear it -- I’ve
          decided... I’m gonna end it with
          George.

                     ANTONIO
          Really?

                    OLIVIA
          It took me way too long, but I
          think I’m finally ready. You
          probably deserve a little credit
          for that.

                    ANTONIO
          Look at us. After everything --
          neither of us are gonna end up with
          the people we thought we wanted.

                    OLIVIA
          Crazy, right?


EXT. KOBRA - LATER

Rudy runs out of the restaurant to Benny.

                    RUDY
          Guey, we got a problem.


EXT. PARAMOUNT PICTURES, BACK LOT - LATER

Olivia walks Antonio out of her trailer.
                                                114.


                    ANTONIO
          Yeah, my sister keeps trying to set
          me up, but I’m gonna lay low for a
          while.

                    OLIVIA
          Don’t wait too long. That night
          ditching the detectives was one of
          the funnest I’ve had in years. You
          got skills.

                    ANTONIO
              (flattered)
          Really?

                    OLIVIA
          Don’t let ‘em go to waste.

Olivia’s phone RINGS. She looks at it.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          George. He keeps calling. Think he
          knows something’s up.

She hits DECLINE.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          I want to be in the right frame of
          mind when I tell him. I’ve tried
          breaking up with him before but he
          always sweet talks me out of it.

                    ANTONIO
          If you get weak, give me a call...
              (re: recorder)
          ...I’ll press play on this thing.

                     OLIVIA
          I will.
              (then)
          Does this mean we’re friends?

                    ANTONIO
          I guess it does.

They smile at each other with genuine affection. But then --
Antonio’s phone buzzes. He checks the text.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          Oh, no. They’re not ordering
          dessert.
                                                115.


EXT. KOBRA - LATER

The Gay Couple walks out of the restaurant. AT THE VALET
STAND, Benny turns to Javier:

                      BENNY
          Oh, crap.

The DRIVER hands his ticket to Benny.

                    BENNY (CONT'D)
          Okay. Alrighty.
              (pretending to text)
          I’ll just let my guys know you want
          your vehicle right away and we’ll
          get that to you lickity-split.
          Gotcha covered... No waiting...

Just then -- the Ferrari drives up.

                    BENNY (CONT'D)
          And, oh my God -- here you are.

Antonio hops out and hold the doors open.

                    DRIVER
          That was fast.

                    ANTONIO
          Kept it close for you, sir.

                    BENNY
          Not asking, but wouldn’t mind a
          nice shout-out on Yelp. Courteous,
          timely, not too much cologne --
          those are just my words.


EXT. ANTONIO'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The full moon lights the palm trees.


INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

PAN ACROSS the empty room to find Antonio sitting on his
couch next to Mr. Kim. They watch an action movie together --
something they both can understand.

They miss Cecilia, but it feels good to have company. Antonio
reaches into his pocket:

                      ANTONIO
          Milk Dud?
                                                116.


INT. OLIVIA HOUSE - DAY

Olivia sits in her living room, reading a script. Her phone
rings. She steels herself, then answers.

                    OLIVIA
          Hi, George.


EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - MOMENTS LATER

Olivia’s RANGE ROVER pulls up next to the black JAGUAR.

Olivia, wearing her hoodie and sunglasses, gets out, looks
around, then climbs into the back of the town car.


INT. ROYCE TOWER, PENTHOUSE - LATER

George opens the door to Olivia, who quickly steps in.

                    GEORGE
          That hoodie gets me every time.

                    OLIVIA
          Promise me again -- you’re really
          leaving her this time?

                    GEORGE
          My bags are packed. Emotionally
          they’ve been packed for years.

                    OLIVIA
          I’m so happy to hear that.


INT. PEREZ’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Perez, Stegman, and... Kathryn sit in the cramp car listening
to the whole thing on an audio device.

                    OLIVIA (O.S.)
          I actually wanted a few other
          people to hear that, too.

                    GEORGE (O.S.)
          What? What’re you talking about?

                    PEREZ
          Sound quality’s pretty good, right?
          Bought it used for under a grand.

Kathryn dials her phone.
                                                117.


INT. ROYCE TOWER, PENTHOUSE - INTERCUT

                    GEORGE
          What the hell’s going on here?

George’s phone rings.

                    OLIVIA
          I think you should get that.

                    GEORGE
              (into phone)
          Hello?

                    KATHRYN
              (into her phone)
          Hello, George.

                    GEORGE
          Kathryn, um... I’m just at the
          market, getting us some wine for
          dinner.

                    KATHRYN
          I’m downstairs listening to
          everything.

George looks out the window to the street. Kathryn waves from
the backseat of Perez’s car.

                    GEORGE
          It’s not what you think. I asked
          Olivia here to tell her to leave me
          alone once and for all.

                    KATHRYN
          Oh, please -- you’re ridiculous.
          And turn around, you’re about to be
          served divorce papers.

Olivia opens the door. Antonio steps in, handing George legal
documents.

                    ANTONIO
          It’s okay, you don’t have to tip
          me.

                    KATHRYN
          I’m also taking the company.

                    GEORGE
          You can’t do that. I built this
          empire from the ground up.
                                                118.


                    KATHRYN
          My father built it. You just
          slapped your name on everything.
          Oh, and you might want to call your
          lawyer. I did some digging and
          found some of your clever off-shore
          holdings. As a member of the board,
          I have a duty to inform the
          authorities.

                    GEORGE
          Olivia, I’m finally free of that
          witch. We can get married.

Olivia’s so appalled, she doesn’t know what to say, until:

                    OLIVIA
          Vete a freir pinas.

Antonio smiles proudly.

                    GEORGE
          You’re speaking Spanish now?! He
          brainwashed you!

                    ANTONIO
          Adios, George.

Antonio and Olivia leave.


EXT. STREET - LATER

Kathryn, Antonio and Olivia stand by Perez’s car.

                    OLIVIA
          I’m so sorry I got involved with
          him. I don’t know what to say.

                    KATHRYN
          When I met George he was married to
          his first wife -- so I knew what I
          was getting.

Olivia smiles.

                    KATHRYN (CONT'D)
          You know this divorce is going to
          get messy. It might be hard to keep
          your name out of the papers.

                    OLIVIA
          It’s okay. It’s the truth. I’m done
          pretending to be someone I’m not.
                                                119.


                    KATHRYN
          We’re all just doing the best we
          can, right?

                    OLIVIA
          It’s exhausting.

                    KATHRYN
          Yes, it is.

Perez steps over.

                    PEREZ
          Don’t mean to interrupt, but who
          should we invoice for this?

                    ANTONIO
          Not me. One of these two.

                    KATHRYN
          I’ve got it.
              (turning to Antonio)
          Mr. Flores, you didn’t ask for any
          of this. Is there anything I can do
          to show my gratitude?

                    ANTONIO
          Um, well...


INT. CITY HALL - A LITTLE LATER

Members of the community crowd the final PLANNING COMMISSION
HEARING on the PICO-UNION DEVELOPMENT. Tensions are high.

AT A LECTERN, Natalie addresses local government officials.

                    NATALIE
          It starts with a bike shop and a
          little bakery, and the next thing
          you know...

ON STAGE an aide hands COUNCILMAN GARCIA a note.

                    NATALIE (CONT'D)
          ...gentrification has eaten out the
          heart and soul of a neighborhood.

                    COUCILMAN GARCIA
          It’s come to my attention the
          developers have changed their mind.

                    NATALIE
          Excuse me? What does that mean?
                                                 120.


                    COUCILMAN GARCIA
          They’ve decided to call off the
          project. It’s not moving forward.

The crowd CHEERS. Natalie hugs the Mechanic.


EXT. ROYCE HOTEL - NIGHT

Two FEDERAL AGENTS escort a handcuffed George out of the
building. Several paparazzi converge, snapping photos.

                    PAPARAZZI
          George!/Over here!/Over here!


EXT. BAKERFIELD, CA - DAY

A working class neighborhood. Olivia drives up to a small
tract house in the middle of the block.

She parks and makes the long walk to the front door.

Olivia KNOCKS and takes a couple deep breathes as she waits.
A TOUGH BROAD in her 70s finally opens the door.

Olivia speaks to her in Ukrainian.

                    OLIVIA
          Hi, Mama. It’s nice to see you.


INT. CITY BIKES - DAY

Antonio walks in carrying all that remains of his stolen bike
-- the FRONT TIRE -- and approaches Natalie at the counter.

                    ANTONIO
          I need a bike to go with this wheel.

                    NATALIE
          Something like that?

She points to the rest of his bike leaning against the wall.

                    NATALIE (CONT'D)
          Bought it off a junkie in the park.
          Figured you’d be in eventually.

                    ANTONIO
          That’s amazing. How much do I owe
          you?
                                                 121.


                    NATALIE
          Eight bucks. He was an awful
          negotiator.

Antonio laughs.

                    NATALIE (CONT'D)
          Did you hear? We get to stay.
          Everyone does.

                    ANTONIO
          Yeah, I was really happy about that.

                    NATALIE
          No one has any idea why they
          changed their minds.

                    ANTONIO
          Sometimes the good guys just win.

                    NATALIE
              (re: bike)
          Well, give me a few hours -- I’ll
          have this up and running.

                    ANTONIO
          Okay. See you in a bit.

Antonio heads out...


EXT. CITY BIKES - CONTINUOUS

...and starts down the block, but stops.

                    ANTONIO (O.S.)
          ...and then I thought, what am I
          doing? Go back and ask her out.


INT. LANGER’S DELI, MACARTHUR PARK - DAY

Antonio and Olivia eat sandwiches in a booth.

                       OLIVIA
          And?

                    ANTONIO
          I think her exact words were, “What
          took you so long?”

Olivia howls with excitement.
                                                122.


                    OLIVIA
          So did you go out? How was it?

                    ANTONIO
          A little weird -- I haven’t been on
          a date in forever, but she’s taking
          me to some band she likes Saturday,
          so I think it went okay.

                    OLIVIA
          Did you kiss her?

                    ANTONIO
          A man never tells. What’s going on
          with you?

                    OLIVIA
          You totally kissed her.

                    ANTONIO
          Think what you want, I’m not saying
          anything. You talk.

                    OLIVIA
          Okay, well... actually I have big
          news. I went home last week.

                    ANTONIO
          You saw your mom?

                    OLIVIA
          Yeah, it’s not like we repaired
          everything, but it’s a start. And
          it turns out I have a half-brother
          who has a two year-old daughter.
          She followed me around everywhere
          and called me Aunt Wivia so I think
          I’m gonna spend Christmas there and
          spoil the crap out of her.

She grabs a pickle off his plate.

                    ANTONIO
          What’re you doing?

                    OLIVIA
          Eating a pickle.

                    ANTONIO
          Get your own pickle.

                    OLIVIA
          I thought you were done.
                                               123.


                    ANTONIO
          I was saving it. If you want more
          pickles, order more pickles.

          I don’t need a whole thing of
          pickles.

PULL BACK thru the window, to outside on the busy street...

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          I just want a bite of pickle.

                    ANTONIO
          Fine. I’ll cut you a small piece.
          But that’s all you’re getting.

...looking in at two friends...

                    OLIVIA
          I’ll order some pickles.

                    ANTONIO
          Just take my pickle. I don’t even
          want it anymore.

...eating lunch together.

                                                FADE OUT.

                    THE END
