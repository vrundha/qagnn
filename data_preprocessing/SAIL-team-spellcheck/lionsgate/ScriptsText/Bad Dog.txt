CLOSE ON A BLOWN-UP PHOTO:

The GLOWERING FACE of DENNIS PRICE, 60’s, a CEO in a $3,000
suit.

TILT DOWN to find the same glowering face wearing the same
suit... only now he’s lying dead in his open coffin. This is
his wake.


INT. FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY

A line of MOURNERS in businesswear pay their respects as they
file past. We find RICK and LARRY at the hors d’oeuvres
table.

                    RICK
          Accounting?

                    LARRY
          Human resources.

                    RICK
          Right. Shame about Mr. Price.

                    LARRY
              (unconvincingly)
          Yeah...

                    RICK
          What?

                    LARRY
          No, nothing.
              (then, quietly)
          He kinda made my life miserable.

                    RICK
          Same! He was the meanest boss I
          ever had.

A woman, GLADYS, leans in.

                    GLADYS
          Are you guys talking about Mr.
          Price?

                    RICK/LARRY
          Uhhh...

                    GLADYS
          ‘Cause I hated that guy.
                                                           2.


                      LARRY
          You too?

A few other EMPLOYEES join in.

                    EMPLOYEE #1
          I don’t know anyone who liked him.

                    EMPLOYEE #2
          I heard he stabbed his assistant
          with a letter opener because he
          brought him the wrong lunch.

Another guy pulls up his sleeve to show a SCAR on his arm.

                    EMPLOYEE #3
          That was me!

                    GLADYS
          He was so drunk with power. He’d
          fire you if you called him by his
          first name.

                    RICK
          Well, I guess Dennis can’t fire us
          now!

They all laugh and toast to that.    More and more people have
joined their circle.

                    LARRY
          Hey, show of hands?
              (re: the coffin)
          Who here hated this guy?

Every hand goes up.

                    LARRY (CONT'D)
          Well, then let’s turn this funeral
          into a par-tay!

Someone cranks up CLUB MUSIC and the crowd begins to
celebrate as Larry leans over Dennis’s body.

                    LARRY (CONT'D)
          See ya in hell, Dennis.

He slams shut the coffin lid as we MATCH CUT TO:

DENNIS’S FACE. Only he’s alive.
                                                          3.


INT. CEO’S OFFICE - DAY

He looks around the bland corner office, confused. He’s
seated across the desk from an empty chair.

                    DENNIS
          What is this? This isn’t my office.

A door opens and SATAN enters from his private bathroom. The
prince of darkness is a slick, sharply dressed figure. Think
Jon Hamm with fucked-up eyes.

                    SATAN
          Sorry to keep you waiting. Blood of
          the innocent gives me reflux.

                    DENNIS
          Who are you?

                    SATAN
          Oh, I’m your boss. Pleasure.

He holds out his hand but Dennis ignores it.

                    DENNIS
          I don’t have a boss, guy. I am the
          boss.

                     SATAN
          Yeah, that ended when you fell off
          your yacht. And your crew decided
          not to notice.
              (then)
          Let me show you your work area.

                    DENNIS
          I’m not going any--


INT. A VAST FILE ROOM - DAY

Satan and Dennis are suddenly standing in the biggest,
dankest file room you’ve ever seen.

                    DENNIS
          --where.
              (realizing)
          How did we--?

                    SATAN
          Oh, here in Hell, we find it saves
          time just to be in the place we’re
          going, rather than all of that
          pesky getting there.
                                                            4.


                    DENNIS
          Did you say... Hell?

                    SATAN
          Specifically your hell, Dennis.
          Your greatest fear is being a
          powerless underling. And that’s
          what you are now. Gonna need you to
          file all these papers.

He gestures to an infinite series of piles that stretch up to
the ceiling in all directions.

                    SATAN (CONT'D)
          But the good news is, if you work
          hard and do your best, you only
          have to do this forever.

                    DENNIS
              (snarky)
          Really? And what’s to keep me from
          walking right out of here?

                    SATAN
          Nothing, I suppose. There’s the
          door.

And with that, Dennis bolts through the door.

                    SATAN (CONT'D)
              (gleefully calling off)
          Hellhounds! Sic ‘em!


INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Dennis finds himself in a massive office filled with infinite
cubicles. He starts running down the hall passing identical
GHOULISH EMPLOYEES that sit mindlessly at their desks.

But something makes Dennis stop dead in his tracks. Fifty
feet ahead of him stand THREE TERRIFYING HELLHOUNDS: PHOBOS,
very dumb, MORPHOS, slightly less dumb, and leading the trio,
BUB (think Rocket from “Guardians of the Galaxy”: cocky,
quick-witted and surly... but with a soft side).

They growl monstrously, their eyes glowing a demonic red.

                     DENNIS
              (mortified)
          Oh my God.
                                                            5.


                    BUB
          Hey! We don’t use that kinda
          language here.

Dennis darts into the rows of cubicles in an attempt to lose
them. Morphos and Phobos race after him. But Bub hangs back.

ON DENNIS as he crouches behind dividers and crawls under
desks. He peers up to see the dogs sniffing around nearby.

Dennis spots an elevator and army crawls toward it. While
Phobos and Morphos search cluelessly around the room, Bub
clambers up onto a file cabinet, giving him a bird’s eye view
of the room. His eyes narrow as he sees Dennis.

At last, Phobos and Morphos spot the man and BOLT toward him.
But the elevator doors close just in time and the two dogs
SLAM FACE-FIRST into it. Both dogs go down hard.


INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

                    DENNIS
          Stupid dogs.

                    BUB (O.S.)
          You got that right.

Dennis turns to find Bub waiting for him in the elevator.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Phobos and Morphos couldn’t catch
          their own tails. Granted, their
          tails are pretty nubby, but you get
          what I mean.

And with that, Bub POUNCES on a terrified Dennis as we tilt
up to see every floor the elevator goes to is “13.”


INT. HELL CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Phobos and Morphos stand opposite Satan with their ears back.
Behind the Dark Lord we see countless monitors showing
different HUMANS being tormented in their own person hells: a
man in a room full of clowns, a woman in a dentist’s chair, a
guy in a room filling with water. Another screen shows FOX
News.

                    SATAN
          What do you mean he escaped?! There
          is no escape.
                                                         6.


                    MORPHOS
          I’m telling you, boss. This Dennis
          guy is like some kinda ninja.

                    PHOBOS
          I’ve never seen anyone move like
          that.

                    SATAN
          He’s an overweight 65 year-old man!

                    MORPHOS
          He’s had 65 years to hone his
          craft.

                    SATAN
          You’re both incompetent. Why is it
          so hard to find a hellhound with a
          brain?

                    BUB (O.S.)
          Where do you want me to put this?

They turn to see Bub, dragging a disheveled, screaming Dennis
by his ankle into the room.

                    SATAN
              (pleased)
          Now, there is a bad dog.

                    BUB
          Just doing my job.
              (to Satan)
          Let me guess. They said he was like
          a ninja?

                    SATAN
          Yup.

                    BUB
          We haven’t had a ninja down here in
          three hundred years, guys. But I
          know it’s hard for you to remember
          with all that muscle where your
          brains should be.

                    PHOBOS
              (angrily)
          I’ll show you my brain-- muscle--
          wait. What did you say?
                                                           7.


                    SATAN
          Excellent work, Bub. As always. Why
          don’t you sleep inside the house
          tonight? I’ll throw a couple
          burglars on the grill for us.

                    BUB
              (thrilled)
          Sweet! I’d love that.

                    SATAN
          Great.

Satan crosses off. Phobos and Morphos can barely contain
their jealousy.

                    BUB
          It’s times like this I wish I could
          form my paw into an “L.”

He grabs Dennis by the ankle again. The man resumes screaming
as Bub drags him out.


INT. SATAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

A cold, modernist mansion with minimal furniture, sharp edges
and polished concrete floor. Lots of Damien Hirst skull
paintings.

Satan sits in a lounge chair eating a questionable looking
burger while Wagner’s “Flight of the Valkyrie” plays in the
background. Bub eats his own dinner from a dog bowl.

                    SATAN
          I don’t know about you, Bub, but I
          could listen to Wagner all day.

The piece ends and Satan claps. WE REVEAL that RICHARD WAGNER
is sitting at the piano.

                     WAGNER
              (German accent)
          Thank you.

                    SATAN
          Once again, Wagner. From the top.

                    WAGNER
              (throwing up his hands)
          Again?! I’ve written hundreds of
          pieces. Why is it always “Flight of
          the Valkyries.”
                                                           8.


                    SATAN
          Because that’s the only one I know.
          And it’s dope.

Wagner sighs and begins playing again. Bub glances up at
Satan and gathers his courage.

                    BUB
          Hey, boss, I was thinking. Maybe I
          could... sit up in the chair with
          you?

                    SATAN
          What?

                    BUB
          I don’t know. You could scratch my
          ears or rub my belly? Nothing
          crazy.

                    SATAN
          Why would I do that?

                    BUB
              (losing confidence)
          Well, ‘cause you like me...

                    SATAN
          I never said I liked you. I don’t
          like anyone.

                    BUB
          But you said I did a good job.

                    SATAN
          And that’s why I keep you around.
          You do your job. Nothing more.

                    BUB
              (covering)
          Right, yeah. Of course.

                    SATAN
          You’re starting to sound like a
          mortal, Bub. Are you looking for
          “love”?

                    BUB
          What?! No way!

                    SATAN
          Because only mortals crave an
          emotion as weak as that.
                                                         9.


                    BUB
          Well, that’s not me. I don’t swing
          that way. I mean there was this one
          time when I was a pup where I
          experimented with some mortal
          stuff, but everyone goes through
          that...

Satan regards Bub, a bit concerned.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Watch this. I’m gonna bite Wagner.

He crosses over and CHOMPS down on the composer’s leg.

                    WAGNER
          Ow!

                    SATAN
          Keep playing! Louder!

Wagner weeps quietly as he resumes playing. Satan claps his
hands gleefully as Bub continues biting. The dog is relieved
that his master has forgotten his odd behavior.

WE MOVE OUTSIDE THE WINDOW to


EXT. HELLSCAPE - CONTINUOUS

Satan’s Neutra-style house sits on the peak of a nightmarish
mountain overlooking a Hieronymus Bosch-like hellscape.

Phobos and Morphos peer in at the seemingly idyllic scene.

                    PHOBOS
          Never lets us bite Wagner.

                    MORPHOS
          Never lets us in the house!

                    PHOBOS
          I’m sick of Bub making us look bad.

                    MORPHOS
          We’re gonna have to get better or
          Satan’s gonna fire us. With real
          fire.

                     PHOBOS
          Honestly, dog, I don’t know if I
          can get any better. I think I’m
          maxed out.
                                                        10.


                     MORPHOS
          Same. I am not special.
              (then)
          Hey, we wouldn’t have to get better
          than Bub if there was no Bub.

                    PHOBOS
          We can’t kill him, Phobos. He’s
          immortal.

                    MORPHOS
          What if we send him through the
          portal? Boom. He’s out of our fur.

                    PHOBOS
          But that’s Satan’s portal. He’s the
          only one who uses it.

                    MORPHOS
          If Satan told you to jump off a
          cliff, would you?

                    PHOBOS
          He has told me to. And I did it.
          And it hurt.

                    MORPHOS
          Look, we’re hellhounds. We’re not
          supposed to play by the rules. And
          what’s more “not playing by the
          rules” than using a portal we’re
          not supposed to use to send a dog
          who’s better than us at our job to
          another plane of existence?

                    PHOBOS
          Well, when you put it that way...
          I’m confused.

                    MORPHOS
          Just follow my lead.


INT. SATAN’S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Bub is asleep by the fire. His legs run in his sleep.

                    BUB
              (mumbling in his sleep)
          ...can’t outrun me, Stalin... I’m
          gonna get ya...

                    MORPHOS (O.S.)
          PSSST!
                                                        11.


Bub wakes up to see Morphos and Phobos tapping on the window.

                    BUB
          What do you want?

                    MORPHOS
          We’ve got a runaway.

Bub sighs and crosses to them.

                    BUB
          Another one?

                    PHOBOS
          Little guy. Fast. Like a--

                    BUB
          Let me guess: a ninja?

Phobos nods sheepishly.

                     MORPHOS
          If Satan finds out we messed up
          again, we’re finished. We need your
          help, Bub.

                    BUB
          Why would I help you losers?

                    MORPHOS
          Look, we know this is Hell and
          we’re supposed to be mean to each
          other and not care about anyone but
          ourselves--

                    PHOBOS
          --and we know you’re better at this
          job than we probably ever will be.

                    BUB
          True.

                    MORPHOS
          But there might come a day when
          something goes wrong for you and
          you need our help. This way we’d
          owe you that.

                    PHOBOS
          So you’re not really helping us.
          You’re helping yourself in the
          future.
                                                        12.


                    BUB
          Hmm. For once, you guys are making
          sense. I’ll do it--

                    MORPHOS
          Great!

                    BUB
          --if you let me pee on you.

                    MORPHOS/PHOBOS
          What?

                    BUB
          I pee on things that I own. And
          since I own you now, I gotta pee on
          you. That’s just how it works.

Morphos and Phobos exchange a resigned look.

                    PHOBOS
          You’re messed up.

                    BUB
          I know.


EXT. HELL DESERT - DAY

Bub grins as he walks beside a wet and unhappy looking
Morphos and Phobos. Around them, craggy salt flats stretch in
all directions. Up ahead, a BEAM OF ENERGY FLOWS UPWARD FROM
A CRATER in the ground, disappearing into the clouds above.

                    BUB
          Where is this guy? All I see is
          Satan’s portal.

                    MORPHOS
          I’m almost sure he headed this way.

                    PHOBOS
          Maybe he’s hiding down there.

                    BUB
          If you let him escape into the
          portal, there’s nothing I can do.
          You’re screwed.

He looks over the edge of the crater and peers down at the
energy flow. Morphos and Phobos share an evil look.

                    MORPHOS
          No, Bub. You’re screwed.
                                                           13.


Bub turns back just in time to see the two dogs charging
toward him.

                    BUB
          Wait!

It’s too late. They slam into Bub. He falls backwards into
the flowing energy which catches him up and yanks him
violently into the sky.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          HELP!

                    PHOBOS
          Who owns who now?!

There’s a beat.

                    MORPHOS
          This won’t totally feel like a win
          until I wash his pee off me.


INT. SPACE BETWEEN WORLDS - MOMENTS LATER

Traveling through the wind tunnel-like portal, Bub screams.
His body slowly morphs into that of a MORTAL DOG.

                                               MATCH CUT TO:


A MOVIE SCREEN

It’s the scene from “The Goonies” where the group helplessly
slides down the underground tunnel.

PULL BACK TO SEE we are in


EXT. TAR PIT PARK - DUSK

A pleasant city park located in the heart of the small town
of HOPEWELL JUNCTION. A large group of PEOPLE on blankets
watch “The Goonies” on a screen. Several yards away, a low
fence cordons off a steaming TAR PIT. Several large
FIBERGLASS DINOSAURS stand beside it.

                    TOMÀS (O.S.)
          Look, girls, they show movies in
          the park.

INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS

TOMÀS (40’s) drives. He’s a nice, positive guy but there’s
something sad in his eyes. With him are his two daughters:
GRACE (15) moody and sarcastic, dressed in black, blue
highlights in her hair, and JENNI (12) eager to please, sits
shotgun, a hamster cage on her lap. The van is packed with
their belongings.

                    GRACE
          Nothing better than sitting on the
          ground watching a movie I’ve seen a
          million times with bad sound and
          picture.

                     TOMÀS
          Fair enough. They’ve also got tar
          pits here.

                    JENNI
          Whoa, cool! Did dinosaurs drown in
          there?

                    GRACE
          Yup. And so did the women they
          accused of being witches in the
          1600’s.

                    TOMÀS
          No, really? How do you know that?

                    GRACE
          When you told us we were moving to
          a town in the middle of nowhere, I
          did some research. Y’know you can’t
          buy beer here on a Sunday?

                    TOMÀS
              (suspicious)
          Why does that matter?

                    GRACE
          It doesn’t. I’m just saying.

                    TOMÀS
          Look, I know this is hard. I know
          it’s been a bad year. But as long
          as we’re all together, we’ll always
          be home.
              (to Jenni’s hamster)
          Right, Sebastian?
                                                          15.


                    JENNI
              (as Sebastian)
          Right, Dad!

                    GRACE
              (to herself)
          We’re not all together.


EXT. TAR PIT PARK - SAME

A hipster couple in their 20’s, ENID and FINN, watch “The
Goonies.”

                    ENID
              (re: the movie)
          Can you hear anything they’re
          saying?

                     FINN
          Not a word.
              (then)
          Hey, Enid?

                      ENID
          Yeah?

                    FINN
          Listen, it’s only been eight months
          since we met, but the second we
          were partnered up in hot yoga, I
          knew I didn’t want to be sweated on
          by any other woman.

He takes a knee and opens a ring box. There’s an ALMOND
inside.

                    FINN (CONT'D)
          I know this is just an almond but
          I’d like you to hold onto it until
          I can get my bamboo clothing
          company off the ground and then
          I’ll buy you the ring you deserve.

                      ENID
          Oh, Finn.

                    FINN
          Will you marry me, Enid?

But before she can answer, there’s a commotion as BUB FLIES
OUT OF THE TAR PIT/PORTAL and lands, covered in tar, on their
blanket. Finn and Enid find themselves splattered with black
goo.
                                                        16.


                     FINN (CONT'D)
              (looking around)
          My almond!

Bub does his best to shake off the tar, splattering them even
more. We can see that Bub LOOKS DIFFERENT here on Earth. In
place of the vicious hellhound, he is now rather adorable.

He looks around, realizing where he is.

                    BUB
          Please tell me I’m not on Earth.
          The only place worse than this is
          Heaven.

                    ENID
          Look, Finn. It’s a dog!

                    FINN
          Must be prehistoric. Probably got
          stuck in the tar millions of years
          ago.

                    BUB
          That theory is about as dumb as
          your name, Finn.

His words come out as ADORABLE BARKS. He can no longer speak.

**NOTE: We hear all ANIMAL DIALOGUE in V.O. as thoughts or as
conversation between animals.**

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          What was that? Was that me? Wait,
          you can’t hear me?

                    FINN
          This is awesome. We’ll be on the
          news and I can plug my bamboo
          clothes.

                    ENID
              (reaching out)
          Come here, little guy. Don’t be
          scared. We’ll call you “T-Rex.”
          Because “Rex” is like a dog’s name.

                    FINN
          Good one, Enid.

                    BUB
          Boy, you two idiots are perfect for
          each other.

                                                          17.

                     BUB (CONT'D)
              (then)
          Get off me.

He SNAPS at her hand which she pulls away.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          I gotta get back home. Out of my
          way, skinjobs!

Bub runs through Enid’s legs and bolts toward the tar pit. He
leaps into the goo.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          All right, Portal. Do your thing.

But instead of being transported back to Hell, he just starts
to SLOWWWWWWLY SINK into the muck.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Okay... this is a bit slower than
          the last time... getting a little
          concerned...

The tar is now almost up to his nose.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          This might have been a mistake...
          HELP! Skinjobs! Get me outta here!

Several well-meaning PEOPLE gather at the sight of this
helpless, yipping pup stuck in the tar.

Enid and Finn run over.

                    ENID
          Dino-Dog! Grab my floppy hat!

She tosses one end of her big, stupid hat to Bub who grabs it
in his mouth. Enid pulls him to safety.

The moment he’s on solid ground, he BITES HER HAND.

                    ENID (CONT'D)
          OW!

                    BUB
          That’s what you get.

He RUNS OFF, zig-zagging across the park, upsetting almost
every movie-goers’ blanket and picnic, leaving a trail of tar
in his wake.
                                                           18.


He looks back and notices one blanket he missed. For good
measure, HE DOUBLES BACK AND TRASHES the last remaining
picnicker.


EXT. HOPEWELL JUNCTION STREET - CONTINUOUS

The tar-covered dog barrels across the street.

                    BUB
              (to himself)
          What do I do?! The portal’s closed.
          I’m trapped here!

Confused and overwhelmed, Bub runs toward the first open door
he sees.


INT. BEDDING SHOP - CONTINUOUS

A quaint shop filled with white linens and fluffy pillows.
Suddenly, Bub bursts in, smearing the place with tar and
racing straight through a display of DOWN PILLOWS.

He emerges TARRED AND FEATHERED as he runs back outside.


INT. MINIVAN - SAME

Tomàs and the girls drive across town.

                    JENNI
          Hey, Dad. Is that our new school?

                    TOMÀS
          Sure is. You know the soccer field
          has an electronic scoreboard.

                    GRACE
              (sarcastic)
          Wow. That makes up for losing all
          my friends to come here.

                    JENNI
          We’ve gotta be positive, Grace.
          You’ll never see the stars if you
          keep looking down.

                    GRACE
          Oh, yeah? What if I’m walking on a
          mirror?
                                                        19.

          C’mon, Grace. You’re not walking on
          a mirror.

Tomàs’s phone rings over the BLUETOOTH.

                    JENNI
          Ooh, it’s Grandma.

                    TOMÀS
          Why don’t we wait till we--

Too late. Jenni has picked up the call.

                    TOMÀS (CONT'D)
              (forced upbeat)
          Hey, Carmen!

                    CARMEN (O.S.)
          Tomàs. We thought you’d call us
          when you got to the new house.

                    TOMÀS
          We’re not there yet. We stopped for
          some Burger King on the way.

                    CARMEN (O.S.)
              (a bit judge-y)
          Burger King. Hmm.

                    TOMÀS
          Yup. Not a lot of options on the
          freeway.

                    JENNI
              (excited)
          Dad got me an Oreo Cookie
          Cheesecake Shake!

Tomàs wishes she hadn’t shared that.

                    CARMEN (O.S.)
          Well, isn’t that something.

Tomàs sighs.


EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Bub, still covered in tar and feathers, trots down the road.

                    BUB
          This is disgusting. I’m all mortal
          up here. I can’t believe I let
          myself get duped by those dopes--

A passing car nearly HITS him.

                    BUB
          Hey, watch it!
              (realizing)
          Wait a minute. If I die, I’ll go
          right back to Hell!

He turns and steps directly into the path of an oncoming
vehicle.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Satan, here I come!


INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS

                    CARMEN (O.S.)
          You know, you could’ve flown out
          there and shipped your car.

                    TOMÀS
          Yeah, but as I said, I’m trying to
          save up some cash until I start
          getting my new paycheck.

                    CARMEN (O.S.)
          Flying is safer.

                    TOMÀS
          Well, I’m a pretty safe driver--

                      JENNI
          Look out!

Tomàs looks up. In the headlights he sees a strange feathered
creature standing in the road. Tomàs SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.


EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

As the van screeches up toward Bub, he suddenly remembers
something.

                    BUB
          Hang on. Didn’t Satan once say “all
          Earth dogs go to Heaven?” Oh no!
                                                        21.


But before he can move out of the way, he’s knocked down by
the van as it stops in front of him.


INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS

                    GRACE
          Dad! You killed it!

                    CARMEN (O.S.)
          Killed what?! What’s going on?!

                    TOMÀS
          Stay in the van, girls.

He unbuckles and gets out of the van.

                    JENNI
          It looked like a giant chicken.

                    CARMEN (O.S.)
          Your father killed a chicken?!

                    JENNI
              (peering over the dash)
          Wait, it’s not a chicken.

                    CARMEN (O.S.)
          Oh, thank goodness.

                    JENNI
          It’s a dog.

Grace and Jenni join Tomàs who is kneeling beside a stunned
Bub.

          You okay, little guy?

                    BUB
          Do I look, okay, you moron?! Just
          ‘cause I was standing in the road
          waiting to get hit, doesn’t give

Tomàs notices a 20-something, gum chewing dude who runs the
newsstand has witnessed the incident.

                    TOMÀS
              (to the dude, forced
               smile)
          Nothing to see here!

                    JENNI
          Is he gonna be okay, Dad?

                    TOMÀS
          He seems okay, but we should
          probably have a vet check him out.

Tomàs scoops up Bub in his arms. Bub growls.

                    BUB
          Put me down, you weirdo!

Grace plucks a feather off Bub’s fur.

                    GRACE
          What’s with all the feathers?

                    BUB
          What’s with all the eye-liner?


INT. VET’S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - LATER

Tomàs and the girls are joined by the VERY OLD VET, DR.

          Well, I’ve got some sad news.

                    TOMÀS
          Oh no.

                    DR. CASEY
          You’ve got a very sick cat there.

                    TOMÀS
          We... we brought in a dog.

                    DR. CASEY
          Ohh. The dog’s fine.

                    TOMÀS
          What a relief.

          DR. CASEY
We cleaned off the tar and the
feathers. He’s a perfectly healthy
pooch. Little bitey.

          TOMÀS
That’s great. I was afraid my first
official act in town was gonna be
murdering a dog.

          DR. CASEY
You folks are new?

          JENNI
My dad is the new soccer coach at
St. Timothy’s.

          DR. CASEY
Wonderful. You girls will love it
here. Y’know we’ve got a tar pit
and movies in the park.

          GRACE
Yup. We saw that.

          DR. CASEY
Well, that’s about the extent of
it.

          TOMÀS
So, Doc, what’s gonna happen to the
dog?

          DR. CASEY
He doesn’t have a microchip so he
has to go to the shelter.

          JENNI
What if no one claims him?

          DR. CASEY
Well, they don’t have room for
every dog...

          JENNI
Can we keep him, Dad?

          TOMÀS
Honey, we haven’t even unpacked.
He’ll be okay at the shelter. I
bet it’s really nice there.

                                     SMASH CUT TO:

INT. ANIMAL SHELTER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

BANG! A steel door is slammed shut and a shelter worker,
STEVE, leads a leashed Bub down a cold, dark hallway lined
with cages. Dogs of all shapes and sizes peer out at the new
“inmate.”

A Doberman with one eye, SNUGGLES, glares at Bub.

                    SNUGGLES
          Well, well. Looks like we got us
          some fresh meat.

A mangy German Shepherd, HEIDI, joins in the heckling.

                    HEIDI
          Hope you like being hungry. ‘Cause
          I’m gonna eat your food.

A massive Pitbull, APRICOT, growls.

                    APRICOT
          You got a real pretty mouth on you.

                    BUB
          Uh... thanks?

Steve places Bub in a cage with another dog, a shivering
little Pekingese named WILLY. The door slams shut behind him.

                    WILLY
              (think Joe Pantoliano)
          Hey, how ya doing? I’m Willy.

                    BUB
          Bub. What is this place?

                    WILLY
          This? This is hell.

                    BUB
          Trust me. This isn’t Hell. Smells
          like it though.

                    WILLY
          Look, tell me if I’m outta line
          here, but can I give you some
          advice? Lay of the land, so you
          don’t step on the wrong paws?

Bub shrugs.
                                                        25.


                    WILLY (CONT'D)
          Those guys you passed? That’s
          Snuggles, Heidi and Apricot. They’s
          kinda the alphas around here. The
          top dogs. If I was you? I’d steer
          clear of them.

                    BUB
          Is that right?

                    WILLY
          Apricot did this to me just for
          lookin’ him in the eye.

Willy shows him a tear in his ear.

                    WILLY (CONT'D)
          Now I’ll never get adopted. No one
          wants a pooch with a wonky ear.

                       BUB
          Adopted?

                    WILLY
          Yeah. That’s the only way out of
          here. Well, except for The Room.

He nods toward the end of the hall at an ominous steel door
with a soundproof window.

                    BUB
          What happens in there?

                    WILLY
          We don’t like to talk about it.
          I’ll just put it this way: that’s
          where they kill you. In that room.
          With poison. They kill you with
          poison in that room.

                    BUB
              (to himself)
          I can’t die here. If I die I won’t
          go to Hell.

                       WILLY
                 (leaning in)
          Huh?

                    BUB
          Can you just give me some space?
          I’m trying to think.
                                                        26.


                    WILLY
          Yeah, you bet.

Bub curls up on a ratty towel.

                    WILLY (CONT'D)
              (quietly)
          Technically, that was my sleeping
          towel, but you’re welcome to it.
          Enjoy. I’ll just lie down here on
          these, uh, cold metal bars.


EXT. PEÑA HOUSE - NIGHT

Tomàs’s minivan parks in the driveway of the quaint home.
Tomàs, Grace and Jenni get out.

                    TOMÀS
          Girls, the dog will be fine. I’m
          sure someone will adopt him.

                    GRACE
          I looked it up. The ASPCA gives the
          Hopewell Junction dog shelter an
          “F” rating. Very high kill rates.

                     TOMÀS
          Boy, you like to look up sad stuff.
              (then)
          Tell you what. We’ll check in
          tomorrow and see if anyone’s taken
          him home.

                    GRACE
          If there is a tomorrow.

                    TOMÀS
          All right-- AHH!

He reacts as he finds a woman, KAREN, 30’s, standing inches
away from him.

                    KAREN
          Hi.

                    TOMÀS
          Wow. Hi. You just kind of appeared,
          huh?

                    KAREN
          I tend to do that. As head of the
          Neighborhood Watch I’ve worked to
          hone my stealthiness.

                    KAREN (CONT'D)
          The key is walking on the balls of
          your feet rather than the soles.

                    TOMÀS
          Hmm. Pro tip.

                    KAREN
          I’m Karen Van Buren. That’s my
          house.

She points across the street to an immaculately maintained
home. On the porch, a VERY OLD, ANGRY LOOKING WOMAN sits
motionless in a rocking chair.

                    KAREN (CONT'D)
          That’s my mother. Also Karen.

                    TOMÀS
          Nice to meet you.

                    JENNI
              (calling to older Karen)
          Hello!

                    KAREN
          She can’t hear you. Her high
          frequency hearing is shot. If you
          want her to hear you, you have to
          speak much lower.

                    JENNI
              (deeper voice)
          Hello!

The old lady just stares.

                    JENNI (CONT'D)
          She still didn’t hear me.

                    KAREN
          No, she did.

                    TOMÀS
          Well, I’m Tomàs. This is--

                    KAREN
          Grace and Jenni. I know. I did a
          bit of Googling after your escrow
          closed. I’m sorry about your wife.

                     TOMÀS
              (a little freaked out)
          Thank you.
                                                        28.


                    KAREN
          Anyway, I’ll get out of your hair.
              (handing him a thick
               binder)
          Here’s everything you need to know.

                    TOMÀS
          About?

                     KAREN
          Oh, basic compliance items. Lawn
          height, porch light intensity,
          sprinkler overspray.
              (grim)
          Sidewalk chalk.

                    GRACE
          You enforce all these things?

                    KAREN
          “Enforce” is a strong word... which
          the sheriff has asked me not to
          use. Think of them as required
          suggestions.
              (heading off)
          If you need anything, mother and I
          are always home. Always watching.

She pads off silently on the balls of her feet.

                    TOMÀS
          Ten bucks says “mother” is a
          skeleton in a wig.

Grace chuckles.


EXT. ANIMAL SHELTER, “THE YARD” - NEXT DAY

We PAN across the prison-like exercise yard where various dog
“prisoners” play with a tennis ball, sniff butts, etc. The
three toughs, Heidi, Apricot and Snuggles, stand together
glaring at the others.

As we PUSH IN to Bub who sits by Willy, we hear:

                    MORGAN FREEMAN (V.O.)
          Some of the boys took him for
          snobby. He had a quiet way about
          him... like he had on an invisible
          coat that would shield him from
          this place...
                                                        29.


                    SHELTER WORKER (O.S.)
          Yo, Steve. Can you help me refill
          the water bowls?

REVEAL Steve the guard is watching “The Shawshank Redemption”
on his phone. He turns it off and heads inside.

                    BUB
              (to Willy)
          I can’t just sit here like this.
          I’m running out of time.

                    WILLY
          I know. We all are.

                    BUB
          No. If I stay on Earth for more
          than four days, I can never go back
          to Hell. I’ll become a mortal dog.
          Like you useless losers.

                    WILLY
          Ouch. What are you gonna do? Break
          outta here? No one’s ever done that
          before. I mean, you got Steve. You
          got the fence. That’s about it.

Ignoring him, Bub studies the air conditioning system,
following the ducts where they lead. Willy trots after him.

                    WILLY (CONT'D)
          Whoa, whoa. You’re getting into
          Alpha territory there!

Sure enough, Heidi, Apricot and Snuggles notice Bub
encroaching into their area.

                    APRICOT
          Hey. Where do you think you’re
          going?

                    BUB
          I’ve got no time for you, Apricot.

                    SNUGGLES
          Oh. Looks like we got a tough guy
          here.

                    HEIDI
          Maybe we gotta teach tough guy a
          lesson, eh Snuggles?

The three larger dogs surround Bub.
                                                        30.


                    BUB
          “A lesson”? From you three? I’ve
          been alive for five thousand years.
          What are you’re gonna teach me? How
          to eat my own poop?

ANGLE ON Apricot who looks up, caught, having eaten something
off the ground.

                    APRICOT
          That wasn’t mine.

The alpha dogs start growling at Bub.

                    BUB
          Hey, look at that. You were right
          about Heidi’s growl, Snuggles. It
          does sound like a kitten purring.

                    HEIDI
              (to Snuggles)
          Hold up. You said that about me?

                       SNUGGLES
          What? No.

                    BUB
          Of course, it’s not as bad as when
          Heidi said that Apricot smells like
          wet dog even when he’s dry.

                    APRICOT
              (hurt, to Heidi)
          I have a condition!

                    BUB
              (to Snuggles)
          Probably the worst, though, was
          when Apricot said you had the
          shortest tail she’s ever seen.

                    SNUGGLES
          Hey! No one’s ever complained about
          my tail.

                    BUB
          Heidi said it’s skinny and short.

                       SNUGGLES
          That’s it!

All at once, the three big dogs square off, bickering and
then attacking one another. Bub steps back, enjoying the
chaos he’s wrought.
                                                         31.


                    WILLY
          I can’t believe they said all those
          things to you.

                    BUB
          They didn’t. I was lying.

                    WILLY
          What’s “lying”?

                    BUB
          Man, you Earth dogs are stupid.
              (yelling)
          THAT’S ENOUGH!

All the dogs on the yard, including the three who were
fighting, stop and turn to Bub.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Listen up. I’m the alpha now!
          You’re gonna help me get outta here
          or else.
              (a la Rorschach in
               “Watchmen”)
          ‘Cause it’s time you realized, I’m
          not locked in here with you. YOU’RE
          LOCKED IN HERE WITH ME!

Simultaneously, every dog ear lays down flat, submissive.


INT. PEÑA HOUSE, GRACE’S ROOM - DAY

Grace unpacks boxes as TOMÀS enters.

                    TOMÀS
          Hey. Y’know there’s an excellent
          music program at this school. I was
          thinking you could pick up the
          guitar again.

                       GRACE
          We’ll see.

There’s an awkward silence. TOMÀS is desperate to break Grace
out of her despondency.

                    TOMÀS
          You know, honey, if you ever want
          to talk... about anything, I’m
          right here.

                    GRACE
          Thanks, but I’m good.
                                                        32.


TOMÀS sighs and exits.

After a beat, Grace takes out a jewelry box. Inside is a
PENDANT encrusted with a striking PURPLE GEM. She opens the
pendant to reveal a PHOTO of herself with her mom, ISABEL.
Both are jamming on guitars and laughing.

                    GRACE (CONT'D)
          This would suck a whole lot less if
          you were here.

She sadly closes the pendant and puts the chain around her
neck.


INT. PEÑA HOUSE, KITCHEN - LATER

Tomàs is on a ladder painting the room when Jenni enters with
an open laptop.

                    JENNI
          Dad, I’ve been thinking about that
          dog we hit.

                    TOMÀS
          Okay...

                    JENNI
          I’ve decided we really do need to
          adopt him and here’s why: number
          one, dogs are super-cute.

                    TOMÀS
          I’m gonna need more than that.

                    JENNI
          Number two. It’s a new town. I’m
          gonna need new friends. Dogs are a
          magnet for meeting people.

                    TOMÀS
          I’m not worried about you making
          friends.

                    JENNI
          Number three, mental health experts
          agree that pets are a wonderful way
          to help children overcome loss and
          emotional tribu-- tribul--

                    TOMÀS
          Sweetie, that’s exactly why I got
          you your hamster.

                    JENNI
          Yeah, but Sebastian’s kind of...
              (whispers)
          ...dumb.
              (normal volume)
          All he does is run on that wheel
          and move his wood shavings into
          piles. It’s just not what my heart
          needs.

                    TOMÀS
          Are you finished?

                    JENNI
          Yes. And so is this little guy if
          we don’t act.

She turns the computer around to show him the website of the
Hopewell Junction Animal Shelter. It’s a photo of Bub beneath
the heading: “SOON TO BE EUTHANIZED”

                    JENNI (CONT'D)
          Grace wasn’t kidding about that
          place.

Tomàs sighs.


INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - DAY

Bub and Willy are in their cage as are the other dogs. A
Cockapoo, BIJOU, across the room glances at Bub and the
hellhound nods.

Bijou begins HOWLING at the top of her lungs. We hear a
BUZZER as the door opens and Steve enters.

                    STEVE
          What’s going on, Bijou?

                    BIJOU
          I’M DISTRACTING YOU! BUB TOLD ME TO
          GO CRAZY TO DISTRACT YOU!

But of course all Steve hears are the yips and wails coming
from the pooch.

He hits ONE OF SEVERAL BUTTONS HIGH ON THE WALL and Bijou’s
cage springs open.
                                                        34.


Steve removes Bijou from the cage and closes the cage door,
failing to notice that Bijou’s cellmate, a Dachshund named
BARRY, has stuck his little paw in the door, preventing it
from locking.

As Steve examines Bijou on an exam table, Barry slips out of
his cage and crosses to an open toolchest on the floor.

                    BUB
          Good, good...

Barry picks up a HAMMER and shows it to Bub.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          No. Screwdriver. We need the
          screwdriver.

Barry puts down the hammer and picks up a pliers.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          That’s a pliers.

Barry puts it back. Picks up the hammer again.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Ugh. The littler they are, the
          dumber they are.

Finally, Barry picks up a screwdriver. But Steve is almost
turning back around.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Good! Yes! Bring it back to your
          cage! Go!

Barry trots back into his cage just as Steve returns with
Bijou. He notices the open cage but fails to notice the
screwdriver in Barry’s mouth.

                    STEVE
          Oops.
              (locking the cage)
          There ya go. No more howling now.

                    BIJOU
          I distracted you. That was my job.

                    BARRY
          And I got a screwdriver, whatever
          that is!

Steve exits the room, the door locking behind him.
                                                           35.


                    BUB
          Now pass it down to me!

With his mouth, Barry passes the screwdriver through the bars
to his neighbor. That dog passes it to the next cage and so
on.

It makes its way to a beagle who holds it in his mouth,
confused. Then he passes it back in the wrong direction.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          No, no! That’s the wrong way.

The beagle turns around and gives it to the other neighbor.
Finally, the tool reaches Heidi, the German Shepherd, who
holds the handle out to Bub. Bub grabs it with his mouth but
Heidi refuses to let go.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Let go!

                    HEIDI
          I can’t! You’re pulling on it.

                    BUB
          So what? Just let go!

                    HEIDI
          My mouth won’t let me! This feels
          like a game.

                    BUB
          It’s not a game! Drop it!

                    HEIDI
              (not letting go)
          TAKE IT! GIVE IT TO ME! TAKE IT!

Bub finally stops trying. Instantly, Heidi drops it in his
cage.

                    HEIDI (CONT'D)
              (like nothing happened)
          There you go.

Bub sighs and is about to start unscrewing the screws in a
WALL VENT, when he hears,

                    BOY (O.S.)
          What about that one, Mommy?

Bub quickly sits on the screwdriver as Steve escorts in a
young BOY and his MOM.
                                                        36.


The pair look in at the beagle.

                    MOM
          I’ve heard beagles aren’t very
          smart.

                    BUB
          Oh, I can confirm that.

Bub’s yip brings the kid to his and Willy’s cage.

                    BOY
              (re: Willy)
          This one’s cute.

                    WILLY
          Thanks. You’re not so bad yourself.

                    MOM
          There’s something wrong with his
          ear.

                    WILLY
              (desperate)
          You can cover that or put a hat on
          me... Or I can stand the other way
          so you never see it.

                    BOY
          I don’t mind his ear. I like him.

Steve presses the button, opening their cage. He hands Willy
to the boy. Willy licks his face.

                    BUB
          Oh, disgusting. You’re getting kid
          face on your tongue.

The kid hugs Willy. Willy is in heaven. Despite his disdain,
we get an inkling that Bub is a little jealous of the
affection he’s witnessing.

                    MOM
          All right, we’ll take this one.

                    WILLY
          Looks like Willy’s found himself a
          home. I’ll see you around, guys.
          Hope you get back to Hell, Bub.

                    BUB
          Yeah. Thanks.
                                                         37.


The humans exit with Willy. Bub goes back to unscrewing the
vent, which he accomplishes by holding the screwdriver in his
mouth and repeatedly ROLLING OVER.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Oh boy, I’m getting dizzy.

At last, the vent cover falls away and Bub climbs into the
vent.


INT. VENT - CONTINUOUS

Bub squeezes his way through the ducts, climbing up a slope
until he finds himself at another vent.

Using his feet, he kicks loose the vent and peers out.


INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

Bub is now looking down on the room of cages where he began.
On the wall directly below him are the SWITCHES that open the
dog cages.

                    BUB
          Everybody ready?!

The dogs answer in a cacophony of nonsense:

                    DOGS
          I’m hungry!/My name is Mike!/What’s
          a screwdriver?!

                    BUB
          Good enough.

He steels himself, then leaves the vent, SLIDING DOWN THE
WALL, hitting as many of the buttons as he can. By the time
he lands on the floor, most of the cages have sprung open.


INT. ANIMAL SHELTER, FRONT OFFICE - SAME

Steve reacts as he hears a chorus of barks echoing from the
cage room. He buzzes open the door and his eyes go wide as he
sees:

FIFTY DOGS CHARGING AT HIM IN SLOW-MOTION. They barrel over
him, knocking him to the floor as they run to the exit, Bub
among them.
                                                        38.


EXT. ANIMAL SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

The dogs burst out of the shelter and head in all directions.
Bub finds himself running alongside his three erstwhile foes:
Heidi, Snuggles and Apricot.

                    HEIDI
          That was amazing! Thanks, Bub!

                    APRICOT
          Yeah, I thought we were all headed
          to The Room for sure.

                    SNUGGLES
          You ever need anything, Bub, we’re
          just a howl away.

                    BUB
          I don’t need anyone or anything so
          get lost.

                    HEIDI
              (teasing)
          Y’know, there’s a heart of gold in
          there somewhere. I can smell it.

                    BUB
          No way you can smell anything over
          your own disgusting funk.

Heidi and the other two laugh as they veer off into the woods
while Bub continues toward the nearest road.


INT. MINIVAN - SAME

Tomàs drives with Jenni.

                    TOMÀS
          A hamster is one thing but having a
          dog is a big responsibility. You
          need to promise you’re gonna take
          care of him.

                    JENNI
          I’ll do everything. Don’t worry.

                    TOMÀS
          That’s easy to say. You have to
          feed him, walk him, make sure he
          doesn’t get off the leash. Because
          he could run right in front of a--
                                                        39.


Tomàs suddenly notices Bub running across the road, directly
in the path of the van. He SLAMS ON THE BRAKES once again.

                    TOMÀS/JENNI
          AHHHHH!

The van stops inches from Bub.


EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

The Peña’s hurry out of the van and find Bub unharmed but
pissed off.

                    BUB
          You again?! What are you? A dog
          hunter?

                    TOMÀS
          Oh my gosh, it’s him!

Before Bub can run off, Jenni scoops him up.

                    JENNI
          This is a sign from above that we
          were meant to adopt him!

                    BUB
          The fact that you almost killed me
          twice? Seems more like a sign from
          below.

                    JENNI
          I’m gonna call you Lucky. ‘Cause we
          were so lucky to find you.

Tomàs is charmed in spite of his misgivings.

                    TOMÀS
          If I didn’t know better, I’d say
          Lucky was smiling.

                    BUB
          This ain’t a smile, jackass. This
          is just the way my lips are shaped.

                    JENNI
          Come on. Let’s get you home.

                    BUB
          I don’t wanna get to your home. I
          wanna get to my home!

Jenni carries him to the van.
                                                          40.


                    BUB (CONT'D)
          ...and she’s putting me in the van.
          Great.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

A passenger, REGINA, 50’s, wakes up in a airplane seat,
jostled violently by BAD TURBULENCE. Looking around, she sees
she’s the only passenger.

                    REGINA
              (freaked out)
          What’s happening?! How did I get
          here? I hate flying!

A flight attendant wheels up a drinks cart.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Hello. Thanks again for choosing
          Hell-ta Airlines.

REVEAL it’s SATAN in a airline uniform.

                    SATAN
          And I know you hate flying. That’s
          why we cooked this up for you. But
          don’t worry about the rough air.
          The captain tells me it should only
          last... forever.

The terrified woman runs out of her row and stumbles down the
aisle.

                    SATAN (CONT'D)
              (calling off)
          Hellhounds! Sic her!

She turns and sees Phobos and Morphos barking and running
behind her. She reaches the lavatory at the rear of the plane
and frantically tries to open it but the door is locked.

                    REGINA
              (losing her shit)
          Please! Please! Help me!

But before the two dogs reach her, they slow to a stop.

                    PHOBOS
          I don’t feel so good...
                                                          41.


                    MORPHOS
          Neither do I.

They both begin to dry heave from air sickness.

                    PHOBOS
          This turbulence is really hitting
          me.

As the damned woman watches the dogs heave and stumble around
in the aisle, her fear gives way to confusion.

Satan fumes.

                    SATAN
          You two are useless!

                    MORPHOS
              (gagging)
          Sorry, boss. I’ve never been great
          with the Hell-ta Airlines bit.

                    SATAN
          I need a real hellhound. Where in
          Hell is Bub?!

Phobos and Morphos exchange a nervous, nauseous look.


EXT. PEÑA HOUSE - LATER

The minivan pulls into the driveway. Tomàs, Jenni and Bub
head inside.

REVERSE to find Karen peering out of her window across the
street. Her eyes narrow at the sight of a dog. After a
moment, her ancient mother, also Karen, leans in behind her.
Her eyes narrow as well.


INT. PEÑA HOME, LIVING ROOM - LATER

Tomàs and Jenni bring Bub inside. Bub takes in the cozy
decor.

                    BUB
              (sneering)
          This is where you live? What a
          heaven-hole.

Grace enters.

                    GRACE
          Seriously? You brought that thing
          home?

                    JENNI
          We almost ran into him again. So I
          named him Lucky.

                    GRACE
          He looks more like an Unlucky.

                    BUB
          Good one, kid. I like that you
          think you’re the clever one.

                    JENNI
          Come on, pup. I’ll show you my
          room.

She exits with Bub.

                    TOMÀS
              (calling after)
          Honey, we don’t even know if he’s
          housebroken.

                    GRACE
          Guess we’ll find out.

Tomàs’s cell phone rings. He looks at it and steels himself.

INT. CARMEN AND FRANCISCO’S APARTMENT - SAME

Tomàs’s in-laws, CARMEN AND FRANCISCO, a well-off, 70-
something couple in a stylish apartment share the speaker
phone.

                    FRANCISCO
          Hi. We thought we’d hear from you
          by now.

                    TOMÀS
          Sorry. It’s been a little crazy.

What?!

          CARMEN
The same dog?!

             TOMÀS
He’s fine.

          GRACE
Now it lives with us.

          FRANCISCO
You’ve barely moved in and you got
a dog?

          TOMÀS
I think he’ll be good for the
girls. Someone close by who can
give them unconditional love.

          CARMEN
    (pointedly)
That used to be us.

          TOMÀS
Look, guys, you know I couldn’t
pass up this job opportunity. And a
small town might be a welcome
change for all of us.

          FRANCISCO
    (changing the subject)
How’s the house?

          TOMÀS
Good. Giving it a little paint job.
The hot water heater is on its last
legs, so I’ll need to replace that
at some point.

          FRANCISCO
Do you need more money?

          TOMÀS
    (quickly)
No. We’re fine. And I’m going to
pay you guys back every dime you
loaned me. That’s a promise.

          CARMEN
Hopefully you won’t be paying us in
dimes?
                                                        44.


Tomàs forces a laugh. Grace rolls her eyes. She doesn’t like
to see her dad emasculated. She goes.

                    FRANCISCO
          We’ve decided we’re going to fly
          out this weekend.

                     TOMÀS
          You are?

                    CARMEN
          We want to make sure the girls are
          okay there.

                    TOMÀS
          Kinda feels like you’re checking up
          on me.

                    FRANCISCO
          Don’t be silly. We just miss our
          granddaughters. Now that you’ve
          taken them 400 miles away.

Off Tomàs’s frustration,

Jenni is enthusiastically showing an indifferent Bub around
her room.

          him out of the funk he’s been in.
          He’s been through a lot. We all

          Wow. You are one compassionate,
          boring kid.

                    JENNI
          And this is Sebastian, your new
          roommate.

She nods to the hamster cage where Sebastian is running on
his wheel. He’s a twitchy, hyperactive spaz. Think the voice
of Charlie Day.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Hey, there. You must be Lucky.

                    BUB
          My name’s Bub. As in Beelzebub.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I’ll call you Lucky, ‘cause I
          didn’t follow that.

                    JENNI
          I’m gonna hang a green curtain here
          so I can have virtual backgrounds
          on my Tik Toks...

As she continues to prattle on, Bub ignores her and speaks
with Sebastian.

                    BUB
          Hey, rat? You wouldn’t happen to
          know how to re-open the portal to
          Hell in those tar pits, would you?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Nope.
              (re: Jenni)
          I think she’s still talking to you,
          by the way.

                    BUB
          Yeah, I don’t care about her.

                    SEBASTIAN
          You should. She’s a really sweet
          kid.

                                                        46.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          She gives me seeds when I’m good.
          I’m not sure what the difference is
          when I’m good or bad, but I love
          the seeds. All kinds of seeds. You
          got any seeds, man?

                    BUB
          No. Calm down.

                    SEBASTIAN
          You know what calms me down? Seeds.
          Sunflower, sesame, poppy. I don’t
          care. I’ll eat any kinda seed. And
          I’ll do anything for ‘em. Anything.

                    BUB
          You’re a mess. Why would these
          people want you for a pet?

                    SEBASTIAN
          They got me after Jenni lost her
          mom--

                    BUB
          Who’s Jenni?

                    SEBASTIAN
          You’re in her room! She’s right
          there!

                       BUB
          Oh, right.

                    SEBASTIAN
          After she died, they got me to make
          Jenni feel better. But now they got
          you. Which tells me I wasn’t making
          her feel better enough. Which makes
          me think I’m not gonna get anymore
          seeds. Which makes me very nervous.
          You got any seeds?

                       BUB
          No!

                    SEBASTIAN
          Maybe there’s one around here.
          Excuse me for a second.

The hamster frantically pushes his wood chips from one corner
of the cage to the other. He finds a single sunflower seed.
                                                        47.


                    SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          Yes!
              (examines it)
          It’s cut with a little sawdust but
          beggars can’t be choosers.

He pops it in his mouth and shudders with ecstasy.

                     SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          Ohhhh, there’s papa’s medicine.
              (then)
          What were we talking about? Oh,
          yeah. You replacing me. I’m not
          jealous or anything. Okay, I’m a
          little jealous. But nothing a run
          in the country can’t fix.

He leaps into his hamster wheel and runs like a lunatic. Bub
glances from the frenzied hamster to Jenni who continues to
enthusiastically describe her room.

                    BUB
          I’m in a nut house.
              (to Sebastian)
          So you don’t know anything about
          the portal in the middle of your
          town?

                    SEBASTIAN
          I can’t hear you! Hang on. Let me
          come back to you.

Sebastian switches directions in his wheel and runs again.
Finally, he hops off.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          All I can tell you is when these
          people need to know something, they
          go to the glow-square.

                    BUB
          What’s a glow-square?

                    SEBASTIAN
          It’s got buttons. It glows. They
          sit in front of that thing for
          hours.

                    BUB
          Oh, a computer. Satan’s got those.
          He’s got a whole troll farm down
          there. Where can I find one?
                                                          48.


                    SEBASTIAN
          Grace has one.

                    BUB
          Who’s Grace?

                    SEBASTIAN
          The other girl! Boy, you really
          don’t know your family, do you?

                    BUB
          They’re not my family.

He goes. Both Bub and Jenni call after.

            JENNI                          SEBASTIAN
Where are you going?             Bring back some seeds!


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Bub walks down the hall to Grace’s door which has a SIGIL OF
BAPHOMET (a Satanic star) taped to it.

                    BUB
          That’s more like it.

He nudges open the door and enters.


INT. GRACE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Bub pokes his head in. The room has a goth theme: black
curtains, posters for punk bands.

                    BUB
          Girl’s got style.

Grace is on her bed, ear buds in, fiddling with the pendant
of her mom.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Hey, poser, where’s your computer?

She doesn’t hear him so Bub JUMPS up onto her bed, startling
her.

                    GRACE
          What the--!

Bub’s eye is caught by the UNIQUE DARK PURPLE STONE inset in
the pendant.
                                                        49.


                    BUB
          What’ve you got there?

He sniffs it.

                    GRACE
              (pulling it away)
          Don’t slobber on that. It’s black
          amethyst. My mom gave it to me.

She takes the pendant and places it carefully in a jewelry
box on a high shelf in her closet.

                    BUB
          I didn’t ask for your life story.
          Now where’s your--

He spots her laptop on the desk.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Bingo.

He trots to her desk, jumps onto her office chair and begins
pawing at the computer.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Dumb little buttons.

                    GRACE
          Hey, hey. Get away from that.

She closes the laptop and shoos him away.

                    BUB
          I’m just trying to get some
          information here. The sooner I get
          it, the sooner I’ll be out of your
          freaky blue hair.

                    GRACE
          You’re my sister’s pet, not mine.
          Just get outta my room.

                    BUB
          I’m nobody’s pet. And I’m not
          leaving till I get what I want.

They have a brief stare-down. Neither flinches. She sticks
her tongue out at Bub. He sticks his out at her.

Curious, Grace suddenly jumps at him with her hands out...

                    GRACE
          BOO!
                                                           50.


Bub gets up on his hind-legs and barks back at her.

                       BUB
          BOO!

                    GRACE
          You’re a weird dog, you know that?

                    BUB
          You’re a weird kid.

                    GRACE
          Whatever. I’m going to bed.

                    BUB
          Good. And I’m gonna use your
          computer as soon as you fall
          asleep. Because hellhounds never
          rest.

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. GRACE'S ROOM - LATER

Grace is fast asleep in bed. TILT DOWN to find Bub fast
asleep on the floor.

After a beat, he SNORTS and wakes up.

                       BUB
          Oh, right.

He moves quietly to the desk and the laptop. Using a pencil
in his mouth, he begins to type a search:

“PORTAL HELL TAR PIT”

The results pop up. He clicks on one and reads the page.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          “Many believe the tar pits of
          Hopewell Junction offer a direct
          connection to the Underworld...
          blah, blah, blah... legend tells us
          that the portal between worlds can
          only be opened by an offering of a
          crown chakra crystal, also known as
          black amethyst.”
              (realizes)
          Black amethyst!

He scrolls down to a PHOTO that shows the distinctive purple
stone. It’s the same kind as the one on Grace’s pendant.
                                                          51.


He turns to the closet where she placed the piece.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Thank you, Satan! That
          ventriloquist girl was right: this
          was a sign!

He shuts the laptop and quietly slinks over to the closet. He
tries to jump up, but the shelf is way too high.

He tries climbing up her hanging clothes but THE ROD BREAKS
and he tumbles back down.

Grace stirs but doesn’t wake up.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          I need something tall.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Bub spots a small side table beneath the open second-story
window at the end of the hall. He puts his paws on the top of
the table and tries to pull it toward him.

The table tips in his direction, then tips back, caught by a
childproofing strap. Framed photos and a couple vases fall
out the window, crashing to the ground.

Across the street, a LIGHT immediately goes on in Karen’s
house. She appears at the window with binoculars.

                    BUB
          You childproof the table but leave
          the window open. Genius.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bub looks around for something to help him. He notices
Tomàs’s ladder, which is covered in a number of paint cans. A
large box fan sits nearby.

                    BUB
          There’s no way this can go wrong.

Using his teeth, he starts to drag the ladder across the
room. As he passes the cord of the box fan, he accidentally
steps on the switch, turning the fan on “high.”

At the same time, the ladder’s leg hits the edge of the
carpet. THE LADDER TEETERS ALONG WITH THE PAINT CANS.
                                                        52.


                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Whoa, whoa...

The ladder falls and the paint cans with it. The cans pop
open as they hit the floor and the whirring fan sends RED
PAINT SPLATTERING ACROSS THE ROOM.


INT. KAREN’S HOUSE - SAME

Karen peers out her window and reacts with horror as she
hears a bang and sees what appears to be BLOOD spatter the
inside of Tomàs’s living room window. It looks like someone
was just shot.

                     KAREN
          Oh my!
              (then)
          All right, Karen. This is what you
          trained for!

She holsters some pepper spray, grabs a Mag Lite and yanks on
combat boots as she dials her cell.

                     KAREN (CONT'D)
          Sheriff Rogers? It’s Karen Van
          Buren!
              (beat)
          I know it’s late.
              (beat)
          No, this isn’t about sidewalk
          chalk. There’s been a murder!

                                                 BACK TO:


INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Paint sprays all over everything, including Tomàs’s soccer
equipment.

Bub looks at the mess he’s made.

                    BUB
          Maybe they won’t notice.

He grips the ladder in his mouth and begins dragging it
toward the stairs backwards. The metal hinge grinds a divot
across the hardwood floor, then tears through more of Tomàs’s
equipment.
                                                          53.


EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Karen marches across the street toward the Peña’s house like
she’s storming the beach at Normandy. Her mother, Karen Sr.,
Peers out from the from door.

                     KAREN
              (deep voice so her mom can
               hear)
          STAY INSIDE, MOTHER!


INT. STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Bub struggles as he hauls the ladder up the stairs with his
teeth. He’s nearly at the top when he loses his grip.

The ladder SLIDES DOWN THE STAIRS like a toboggan.


EXT. PEÑA HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Karen reaches up to knock on the door, but before she does,
it is SMASHED OPEN by the ladder. Karen goes flying back off
the porch.

                     KAREN
              (small)
          My coccyx.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Tomàs, Grace and Jenni all open their bedroom doors, woken by
the noise. They find Bub standing at the top of the stairs.

                    BUB
              (caught)
          The hamster did it.

                                                     CUT TO:


EXT. PEÑA HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER

The sun is coming up. Tomàs waves to a police car as it
drives off.

                    TOMÀS
          Sorry about the mix-up!

He joins an angry but uninjured Karen who stands at the door
with Grace, Jenni and Bub.
                                                        54.


                     JENNI
          He was just following his
          instincts.

                    KAREN
          His “instinct” to carry a ladder
          upstairs? What is he, a fire dog?!

                      BUB
          In a way.

                    TOMÀS
          We’re really sorry about this.
          We’ll get a crate.

                     KAREN
          Sorry doesn’t cut it. What if it
          had been my mother on the other
          side of that door? I’m quite sure
          her coccyx is not as resilient as
          my coccyx.

                    TOMÀS
          Could you please stop saying
          “coccyx” in front of the girls?

                    KAREN
          Look, our neighborhood regulations
          clearly state that no animal
          considered a nuisance may be kept
          as a pet.

                    JENNI
          Lucky is not a nuisance!

Grace regards the broken door and the trashed living room.

                    GRACE
          He kinda is.

                    KAREN
          I’m contacting Animal Control and
          he will more than likely be taken
          to a shelter.

                    BUB
          That place again?

                    JENNI
          You can’t do this.
                                                        55.


                    KAREN
          Missy, unless he is a certified
          emotional support animal, I most
          certainly can.

Seeing how forlorn Jenni looks at the prospect of losing Bub,
Tomàs makes a decision.

                    TOMÀS
              (thinking fast)
          That’s fine. Because he is an
          emotional support animal.

                     KAREN
          Really. Where’s his little vest and
          paperwork?

                     TOMÀS
          In the moving boxes. I’ll have to
          find them.

                    KAREN
          I look forward to seeing that as
          soon as you do. Because if you
          don’t, that... creature is history.
              (beat, suddenly cheerful)
          And I hope we get to see you at
          our annual pumpkin carve next week.
          B.Y.O.P.

Karen pads away on the balls of her feet.

                    BUB
          I’ll definitely be seeing this
          broad after she dies.


INT. PEÑA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The family enters. Tomàs does his best to shut the broken
door.

                    JENNI
          Dad, Lucky isn’t an emotional
          support dog.

                    TOMÀS
          I know that, honey. He’s more the
          opposite.

                    JENNI
              (hugging Bub tightly)
          But I don’t want to lose him.
                                                        56.


                    BUB
          You’re gonna lose me if you keep
          squeezing me like that, Lenny.

                    TOMÀS
              (sighs)
          Fine. We’ll see if we can get him
          certified... But I’m really
          starting to regret hitting him with
          the van.
              (looks at his watch)
          Oh, no. I’m gonna be late for my
          first day. All of our first days.
          Everyone get dressed!

As he throws his soccer supplies into a gear bag, we

                                                  CUT TO:


EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY

Satan walks along a perilously high ledge with Phobos and
Morphos at his heels. Hundreds of feet below we see a city
street.

                    SATAN
              (calling out)
          Bub! You here, boy?

They pass a middle-aged man, HANK, who clings terrified to
the side of the building.

                    HANK
          Help me, please! I can’t take
          anymore!

                     SATAN
              (ignoring him, to the
               dogs)
          I thought you said you last saw him
          in Heights Hell.

                    MORPHOS
          I did! Unless it was in Wool
          Sweater with No Undershirt Hell...

Satan stops and looks down at the dogs.

                    SATAN
          What is this?

                    PHOBOS
          What do you mean, your Unholiness?
                                                         57.


                    SATAN
          You’re lying. I know because I
          invented that. What are you hiding?

Phobos and Morphos snap under his glare.

                    MORPHOS
          We’ll tell you, but you have to
          promise you won’t get mad.

                       SATAN
          I promise.

                    PHOBOS
              (sheepish)
          We pushed Bub into the portal and
          sent him to Earth.

Satan grits his teeth with rage and SHOVES BOTH DOGS OFF THE
LEDGE. They scream as they fall hundreds of feet till they
can’t be heard anymore.

POP! POP! Both of them reappear on the ledge.

           MORPHOS                            PHOBOS (CONT'D)
Ow!                               I landed on a fire hydrant.

                       SATAN
          When?

                    MORPHOS
          Two days ago.

                    SATAN
          Then he’s only got two left.

Satan walks away.

                       SATAN (CONT'D)
          Come on.

                       PHOBOS
          Where?

                    SATAN
          Where else? Earth. We’re getting my
          dog back.

He SLIPS A RING ON HIS FINGER. It has a BLACK AMETHYST at its
center.

The dogs scamper behind him, leaving poor Hank to his fate.
                                                        58.


EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

Tomàs holds Bub on a leash as the girls get out of the van
and head toward the building. Jenni carries her dummy, Lulu.

                    GRACE
          You’re really bringing the dog to
          school?

                    TOMÀS
          You saw what he did last night. I
          can’t leave him alone in the house.

Bub stares up at the PENDANT Grace is wearing.

                    BUB
          Gimme that black amethyst and I’ll
          leave you alone forever.

He jumps up on Grace, trying to reach the pendant.

                     GRACE
          Get off!

Tomàs hands her a Post-It.

                    TOMÀS
          Here’s the address for the trainer.
          You’re gonna have to take him after
          school.

                    GRACE
          Why do I have to do it?

                     TOMÀS
          Jenni’s got rehearsal for the
          talent show and I have a staff
          meeting... where they’ll probably
          yell at me for being late on my
          first day.

Jenni sees that her dad is stressed out.

                    JENNI
              (coy)
          Don’t worry, Dad. I have a feeling
          once you see tomorrow night’s
          talent show, you’ll feel much
          better.

                    TOMÀS
          That’s very sweet, Jenni.
                                                        59.


                    BUB
              (to Jenni)
          Boy, you are really putting a lot
          of weight on that talent show.

As they near the building, he looks up and sees a giant
statue of the school’s mascot: BERNIE THE ST. BERNARD. It’s a
caricature with floppy ears and a silly long tongue.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          That’s just offensive.

They reach the door.

                    TOMÀS
          All right. Grace, Jenni, you are
          strong, fierce young women and
          you’re gonna take this school by
          storm. Family high-five!

                       JENNI
          Woo hoo!

Jenni gives him an enthusiastic high-five. Grace grimaces as
she gives a begrudging one.


EXT. SOCCER FIELD - SHORT TIME LATER

Tomàs rushes out onto the field. He carries his gear bag. A
first period P.E. class of 12 year-old STUDENTS are already
waiting.

                       TOMÀS
          Hey, guys!

                    STUDENT #1
          You’re late.

                    TOMÀS
          Yup. Sorry about that. Won’t happen
          again. I’m Coach Peña. Why don’t we
          get started with--

Another kid raises his hand.

                       TOMÀS (CONT'D)
          Yes?

                    STUDENT #2
          I heard the police were at your
          house last night?
                                                           60.


                    TOMÀS
          Wow. This is a small town. That was
          just a misunderstanding.

                    STUDENT #3
              (to the other kids)
          I heard he murdered someone.

                    STUDENT #1
          Are you a serial killer?

                    TOMÀS
          Whoa! No. I am not a serial killer.
              (to himself)
          I can’t believe I have to say this.

                    STUDENT #2
          So, you just killed one person?

                    TOMÀS
          I didn’t kill anyone. Now, no more
          talk about murderers or serial
          killers. I’m just an ordinary dad
          and soccer coach.

He unzips his gear bag and begins tossing jerseys to the
students.

                    TOMÀS (CONT'D)
          Let’s get these jerseys on and
          start some drills.

As the kids unfold the jerseys, they react with horror as
they see they are all torn up and SPLATTERED WITH BLOOD-LIKE
RED PAINT thanks to Bub’s exploits the previous night.

                    TOMÀS (CONT'D)
          That’s just great.


INT. TOMÀS’S OFFICE - SAME

Bub’s leash is tied to a metal coat rack in Tomàs’s new
office alongside the gym. Among the jackets and uniforms is
the school’s MASCOT COSTUME: a large-headed Bernie the St.
Bernard.

                    BUB
          I don’t have time for this. I’ve
          gotta find Grace and get that thing
          off her neck.

He strains against the leash and the coat rack moves
slightly.
                                                           61.


                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Maybe if I just...

He pulls harder. Finally, the rack topples over. The end of
the leash yanks free... but KNOCKS LOOSE THE MASCOT HEAD
WHICH LANDS DIRECTLY ON BUB’S. He can see through the eye
holes but can’t shake it off him.

                     BUB (CONT'D)
          Aw, come on!
              (then)
          Ugh. Smells like teen spirit in
          here.


INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Bub walks down the hall wearing the oversized cartoon head.

                    BUB
          Grace! Where are you?!

He peers in a few classroom windows but can’t find her. A
JANITOR turns a corner, heading his way.

Bub ducks into a storage closet, then realizes the mascot
dog’s nose is caught in the door. At the last second, he
yanks it inside. The janitor passes, none the wiser.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Whew.


INT. GRACE’S CLASS - SAME

Grace sits bored in English class as her teacher, MR.
ANDERTON, is giving a lecture on Dante’s “Inferno.”

Grace looks at her fellow students. They all appear very
“normal.” One girl glances over at her. Trying to make a
connection with her, Grace nods to the teacher and makes a
“sleeping” face. The other girl frowns, not amused, and goes
back to taking notes.

Just then, unnoticed by the students, the Bernie the St.
Bernard head pops up in the window of the door.

                    MR. ANDERTON
          ...Cerberus, the three-headed
          hellhound, would guard the gates of
          Hades to prevent the damned from
          escaping...
                                                         62.


                    BUB
          Oh, that guy. So arrogant. Except
          for the left head. He was all
          right.
              (then, noticing)
          Grace! Over here!

Grace looks around at the quiet yip. There’s something
familiar about it.

Sure enough, she spots Bub, wearing the giant mask, jumping
up and down outside the door.

                    GRACE
              (to herself)
          What the--?

She raises her hand.

                    MR. ANDERTON
          Oh, Grace. Our new student. I’d
          love to hear what you think about
          Dante.

                    GRACE
          Can I go to the bathroom?

                    MR. ANDERTON
              (disappointed)
          Sure.


INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Grace removes the mascot head from Bub as she hurries him
down the hall.

                     BUB
          Free at last!
              (then)
          Hey, I just came from this way.
          Don’t take me back there!

                    GRACE
          You’re gonna get my dad fired.

                    BUB
          You don’t understand. I can’t leave
          without that necklace.

Bub looks at her with pleading eyes.

                    GRACE
          What is it? What do you want?
                                                        63.


                    BUB
          That! The amethyst!

He “points” with his paw at the pendant.

                    GRACE
          What? My uniform?

                    BUB
              (sarcastic)
          Yeah, I want to dress like a
          Catholic school girl.

                    GRACE
              (touching her necklace)
          This?

Bub seems to be finally getting through to her.

                    BUB
          For Satan’s sake, YES!

But just then they are interrupted:

                    CODY (O.S.)
          Whoa. You swiped Bernie’s head?

They turn to see three teens, CODY, LINDSAY and OWEN, sitting
under the stairwell, ditching class. Their uniforms are
untucked. These are clearly the “bad” kids of the school.

Grace looks down at the mascot head under her arm.

                    GRACE
          Uh--

                    CODY
          That’s classic.

                    GRACE
          Oh, thanks.

                    BUB
          I’m the one who did it.

                    LINDSAY
          Cute dog. How do you get to bring
          him to school?

                    GRACE
          We just got him and my dad’s the
          new soccer coach--
                                                           64.


During the following, Bub tries repeatedly to jump up on
Grace and grab the pendant. She shoves him off.

                    OWEN
          Weren’t the cops at your house last
          night?

                    CODY
          What’s up with that?

                    GRACE
          Oh, well, it was--

                    LINDSAY
              (to Owen)
          Oh my god, do you remember when the
          cops raided Dylan’s party and we
          were all wasted?

They laugh. Grace chuckles awkwardly.

                    BUB
              (sarcastic)
          Wow. What a great story. So many
          twists and turns.

Grace hunts for something she can say to impress these kids.

                    GRACE
          Hey, I heard you can’t get beer
          here on Sundays.

                    OWEN
          It’s like the dumbest rule ever.

                    GRACE
          Guess you just gotta drink twice as
          much on Saturday, right?

The kids stare at her for a beat, then laugh.

                    CODY
          Hey, we were about to ditch and get
          tacos at Jack-in-the-Box. You wanna
          come?

                    GRACE
          Um...

Bub jumps up on Grace again.

                    GRACE (CONT'D)
          I should probably get him back.
                                                        65.


                    LINDSAY
          That’s cool. What’s your name?

                    GRACE
          Grace.

                    LINDSAY
          I’m Lindsay. That’s Cody and Owen.
          Give me your number. Maybe we’ll
          chill sometime.

                    GRACE
          Okay.

She hands over her phone. Grace is pleased. Maybe she’s found
a clique.


INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

Jenni sits at a table with Lulu, her dummy, practicing her
act.

                     JENNI
              (Lulu voice)
          Hey, Jenni?
              (normal voice)
          Yes, Lulu?
              (Lulu voice)
          What did the right eye say to the
          left eye?
              (normal voice)
          I don’t know, Lulu. What did the
          right eye say to the left eye?

She suddenly hears WHISPERS and looks up to see several kids
are staring at the new girl talking to her wooden doll.

                    JENNI (CONT'D)
              (weakly, Lulu voice)
          Between us, something smells.

Self-conscious, she stuffs Lulu in her backpack.


EXT. TAR PIT PARK - DAY

A HOMELESS MAN sits with a cup of coins in front of him. His
cardboard sign reads “Spare Change?” He looks up as he sees
bubbles forming on the surface of the tar pit.

Suddenly, THREE HEADS EMERGE from the goo: one human, two
dog.
                                                        66.


The black forms rise eerily from out of the black liquid
until we can see it’s a NOW-MORTAL SATAN with his two mortal
dogs, Phobos and Morphos. Their eyes have lost their demonic
glow.

The tar-covered trio walk calmly past the Homeless Man. Satan
regards his sign.

                    SATAN
          Don’t mind if I do.

Satan empties the coins into his hand and continues on. He
looks down at his filthy suit.

                    SATAN (CONT'D)
          I can’t walk around like this.

He notices an OLD NAVY store nearby.

                                                  CUT TO:


EXT. STREET - SHORT TIME LATER

Satan emerges from the store wearing a slim-fit bright blue
polo shirt and a pair of tapered khaki chinos. Morphos and
Phobos marvel at his new look.

                    PHOBOS
          You clean up nice, boss.

Satan doesn’t respond.

                    MORPHOS
          He can’t understand you up here.
          We’re all mortals, remember?

                     PHOBOS
          Really?
              (then)
          You suck, Satan!

The two dogs laugh.

                    PHOBOS (CONT'D)
          This is fun.

                    SATAN
          We need to figure out where Bub
          went after he came out of there.
          Start sniffing around.

                    MORPHOS
          Aye, aye, Captain Douchebag!
                                                        67.


They laugh some more. Satan notices a trail of dog tracks on
the sidewalk leading out of the linen store.

                    SATAN
          Did you make these?

The dogs shake their heads.

Satan follows the tracks into the street where they abruptly
end.

                    SATAN (CONT'D)
          Where did he go?

He looks around and sees the newsstand and the gum-chewing
dude from earlier. He heads over.

                       SATAN (CONT'D)
          You there.

                       NEWSSTAND GUY
          Yeah?

                    SATAN
          Did you happen to see a dog covered
          in tar around here? About two days
          ago?

                    NEWSSTAND GUY
          Oh, yeah. He got hit by a car.

Satan gasps.

                       MORPHOS
          Yes!

                    NEWSSTAND GUY
          I think he was okay, though.

                       MORPHOS
          Dang it!

                    SATAN
          What happened to him?

                    NEWSSTAND GUY
          I think the guy who was driving
          took him to the vet.

                       SATAN
          Thank you.

                    NEWSSTAND GUY
          No worries.
                                                           68.


Satan notices a newspaper headline: “SINKHOLE KILLS DOZENS AT
KLAN RALLY.”

                    SATAN
          It’s gonna be a busy week at the
          office.

He heads off.


EXT. ROLAND’S BACKYARD - LATER

Grace stands with Bub alongside a few other DOG OWNERS and
their pets. The trainer, ROLAND, 40’s, soft-spoken but
intense, holds court.

                    ROLAND
          Welcome, I’m Roland. I’m glad to
          see many of you returning as well
          as some new faces.

             GRACE                             BUB
   (to herself)                     (to himself)
I don’t want to be here.         I don’t want to be here.

Bub looks down the line of dogs. Most of them gaze up at
Roland attentively.

                    ROLAND
          Before we start, I’d like to ask
          all owners to remove any bracelets
          or jewelry. Anything that might
          make a jingling sound. Dogs are
          sensitive to high-pitched sounds.

Grace shrugs and removes her pendant.

                    BUB
          There it is.

She zips it into a pocket of her backpack and sticks it in a
cubby by the house. Bub immediately goes for the backpack but
Grace pulls on his leash.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Ow! Y’know, you’re a real piece of--

                    ROLAND
          Let me make one thing clear. I am
          not here to “train” your dogs. I am
          here to help you forge an emotional
          connection with your animal.
          Because when a dog knows you love
          him, he will want to serve you.
                                                           69.


                    BUB
          An emotional connection between a
          dog and a person? Yeah, right.

A golden retriever, ROXY, hears him.

                    ROXY
          Do you mind? Roland is talking.

                     BUB
          I just don’t understand this.
          People keep dogs around because
          they’re useful. Not because they
          love them.

A shivering teacup Pomeranian, JASPER, chimes in.

                    JASPER
          What am I useful for? I get
          seizures from sunlight.

An ancient bulldog, LOUISE, speaks up.

                    LOUISE
          I can barely walk or see.
              (re: her owner)
          If he didn’t love me, why would he
          spend all that money keeping me
          alive?

Bub considers this. This is uncharted territory for him.

                    ROLAND
          Let’s try an exercise. Tamborine,
          can you come up, please?

A SHIH TZU, TAMBORINE, proudly trots up.

                    ROLAND (CONT'D)
          Tamborine is one of my prized
          students. There’s a level of real
          trust between us.

                    TAMBORINE
          Love you, Roland.

Roland takes a TREAT from a pouch on his belt and places it
on the dog’s snout.

                    ROLAND
          Tamborine won’t eat the treat until
          I give her permission to.
                                                        70.


                    BUB
          Cuck alert!

                    ROLAND
          Because she trusts that I will give
          it to her--

Suddenly, Bub steps forward and eats the treat off the other
dog’s nose.

                    TAMBORINE
          Hey!

                    BUB
          I did you a favor. You looked
          ridiculous.

                    ROLAND
              (to Grace)
          What is your dog’s name?

                    GRACE
          Lucky.

                    ROLAND
          Will you bring Lucky forward,
          please?

Grace steps forward with Bub.

                    ROLAND (CONT'D)
          Let’s try a trust exercise.

                    BUB
          Sure. You wanna fall backwards and
          see if I catch you?

Roland holds a treat in his hand.

                    ROLAND
          Now, Lucky, you’re not to eat this
          treat until I--

Bub gulps down the treat from his hand. Grace and the other
dog owners chuckle. Roland smiles patiently.

                    ROLAND (CONT'D)
          Okay, let’s try this again.

He takes another treat from his pouch, this time holding it
higher above Bub’s head.
                                                        71.


                    ROLAND (CONT'D)
          You will get the treat when you
          show me that--

But Bub jumps up, using Tamborine’s back like a springboard,
and snatches up the treat in midair.

                    BUB
          I can do this all day.

Roland’s smile gets a bit tighter as he takes another treat
from his pouch and holds it even higher.

                    ROLAND
          Lucky, you’re not to take the treat
          until--

Bub head-butts Roland in the crotch. The trainer doubles over
and Bub grabs the treat.

                    BUB
          I thought this class would be
          boring but it’s pretty fun.

Roland stands up, clearly annoyed now. He takes out another
treat from the pouch, grips it tightly with one hand and
holds the other protectively in front of his groin.

                    GRACE
          Come on, Lucky.

                    BUB
          No, no, it’s okay. I got this.

                     ROLAND
          I will not stop drilling you until
          you obey--

Bub suddenly looks past Roland and BARKS WILDLY.

                    BUB
          Behind you! Your house is on fire!

Roland turns to see what Bub is barking at. Bub lunges
forward, grabbing Roland’s belt pouch and yanking it down.
Treats fall everywhere as the trainer’s pants fall to his
ankles.

Roland lands on his hands and knees as Bub mounts him from
behind and begins vigorously humping away.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          And I will not stop drilling you
          until you obey!
                                                          72.


Grace laughs in spite of herself.

                                            INTERNAL CUT TO:


EXT. ROLAND'S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER

The dog owners and their pets have broken into small groups
to practice on an obstacle course. Roland, pants back on,
stands with Grace and Bub.

                    ROLAND
          I’m afraid Lucky will never be an
          emotional support animal. He seems
          incapable of trust. And without
          that there’s no way for dog and
          owner to become close.

                    BUB
          I just need to get close enough to
          grab that freakin’ pendant.

                    GRACE
          Sorry, Lucky. Looks like you’re
          going back to the shelter.

                    BUB
          No! I’ve only got two days left!

He looks around the yard, seeing dogs and their owners
happily bonding as they build trust. He makes a decision.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Only way I’m gonna get that
          necklace from her is if I get her
          to trust me.
              (then, to Roland)
          You want me to play the game, you
          fascist? Watch this.

And with that, he runs over to the obstacle course,
EFFORTLESSLY ACING EACH CHALLENGE. He climbs a ramp, slides
down a slide, slaloms the training poles and jumps through a
series of hoops.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          I’m literally jumping through hoops
          here.

Grace and Roland watch with shock.

Bub returns and nudges Roland’s treat pouch. Tentatively, the
trainer holds out a treat. But instead of eating it, Bub
flips it up onto his own nose and waits.
                                                          73.


                    BUB (CONT'D)
          You want me to sit? Roll over? Do
          your taxes?

He sits and rolls over, balancing the treat as he goes.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Hind legs? You got it.
              (balances on hind legs)
          What else do these losers do? Oh
          right, shake.

He holds out a paw to Grace. She shakes it.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Good to meet you.

He offers the paw to Roland.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Now can I get my damn vest?

Blown away, Roland shakes his paw. Grace looks at Bub,
impressed.

                      GRACE
          Good dog.

For the first time, Bub doesn’t hate being called this.

                                                  CUT TO:


EXT. STREET - SHORT TIME LATER

Grace can’t help smiling as she walks Bub in his new red
service dog vest home. Bub sings to the tune of Kool and the
Gang’s “Celebration.”

                    BUB
          I’m gonna get your pendant
          tonight/Let’s celebrate/It’s all
          right...

As they pass Karen’s house, they see the nosy neighbor and
her mother peering out. Grace smiles and waves insincerely at
the Karens and points to Bub’s new vest.

The Karens grimace and close the blinds.
                                                          74.


EXT. PEÑA HOUSE - THAT EVENING

Tomàs arrives home and gets out of the van. He looks
curiously at a Mercedes parked in the driveway.


INT. PEÑA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Tomàs enters.

                    TOMÀS
          Hey, girls, whose car is that
          outside?

                    FRANCISCO (O.S.)
          It’s our rental.

Tomàs turns, surprised to see his in-laws are sitting with
the girls and Bub in the kitchen.

                    JENNI
          Grandma and grandpa are here!

                    TOMÀS
          I see that. Hey guys.

They exchange cordial hugs.

                    TOMÀS (CONT'D)
          I thought you were coming tomorrow.
              (glancing at the trashed
               living room)
          You didn’t give me a chance to
          clean up.

                    CARMEN
          You think you could’ve cleaned that
          up in a day?

                    TOMÀS
          It’s the new dog. We’re still
          training him.

                    FRANCISCO
          And yet he’s a “service dog.” What
          service does he provide?
          Demolition?

                    BUB
          I like this old guy. He’s mean.

Tomàs pushes the button on his answering machine. BEEP!
                                                75.


                    PRINCIPAL (O.S.)
              (on machine)
          Tomàs, it’s Principal Warren. If
          you can stop by my office tomorrow,
          I wanted to discuss what happened
          this morning. Some of the kids were
          a little freaked out. Thanks.

Tomàs looks at his in-laws, embarrassed.

                    TOMÀS
          That was just a misunderstanding--

BEEP!

                    KAREN (O.S.)
              (on machine)
          Hi, this is Karen. I wanted you to
          know that I got an X-ray of my
          coccyx. It’s not broken but it is
          bruised. I’m assuming you’ll be
          paying for my physical therapy?
          Call me.

                    TOMÀS
          She’s crazy.

                    BUB
          Not sure why you thought it was a
          good idea to play these in front of
          your in-laws.

BEEP!

                    DR. CASEY (O.S.)
          Uh, yes, hello. This is Dr. Casey,
          the vet. I’m sorry to have to tell
          you that your cat has passed away--

Tomàs stops the machine.

                    TOMÀS
          All right, that seems like enough
          messages.

Francisco and Carmen share a concerned look.

                    CARMEN
          How worried do we need to be,
          Tomàs?

                    TOMÀS
          Everything’s fine. It’s just a
          settling in period.
                                                        76.


Jenni jumps in to defend her dad.

                       JENNI
             You don’t need to worry. We love it
             here. Right, Grace?

Grace shrugs.

                       JENNI (CONT'D)
             I made a bunch of friends at school
             already, I love this house, and if
             we didn’t move here, we never
             would’ve met Lucky.

                       CARMEN
             I’m happy to hear that, corazón.

                       TOMÀS
             So, where are you guys staying?
                 (joking)
             The Four Seasons Hopewell Junction?

                       FRANCISCO
             We thought we would stay with you
             if that’s all right.

                       TOMÀS
             Uh... of course. I’ll make up the
             guest room.

                       GRACE
                 (grabs her backpack)
             Well, I’ve got some homework.

                       BUB
             I’ll go with her.

They exit.

                       JENNI
                 (calling after)
             Don’t you want to watch me rehearse
             my show, Bub?

                         BUB (O.S.)
             I’m good!


INT. GRACE'S ROOM - LATER

Grace is getting ready for bed while Bub sits on the floor
eyeing her backpack.
                                                           77.


                    GRACE
          I still don’t know how you did all
          that stuff today. Were you, like, a
          circus dog before we found you?

                    BUB
          No, but there are a lot of clowns
          in Hell. And elephant trainers.

She turns away, giving Bub the opportunity to reach for her
bag. He starts to unzip the pocket with his mouth,
accidentally knocking over her guitar that leans against the
wall.

                     BUB (CONT'D)
          Whoops.

                     GRACE
          Careful.

She picks it up. Stares at it for a beat, lost in memories.

                    BUB
          What’s wrong with you?

Forgetting he’s there, she sits on the bed and starts
noodling around.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          You’re not bad. Better than that
          Wagner guy.

She plays the opening bars of “The Wind” by Cat Stevens.
Even Bub can’t help getting caught up in the melody.

She finishes and puts the guitar back.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          I’d clap, but
              (re: his paws)
          ...these things don’t really do
          that.

                    GRACE
          My mom taught me that song.

                     BUB
          This is the mom who died?
              (then)
          Stupid question.

                    GRACE
          She wasn’t like a normal mom,
          y’know?
                    (MORE)
                                                           78.

                     GRACE (CONT'D)
          She was almost a kid in a grownup’s
          body.
              (beat)
          She was my best friend.

She sighs as she gets into bed and switches off the light.
After a beat,

                    GRACE (CONT'D)
          Hey, Lucky? If you want, you can
          sleep up here.

She pats the bed.

                    BUB
          Yeah?

He looks from her to the backpack.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          I suppose I can spare a couple
          minutes.

He jumps up onto the bed. Grace puts an arm over him and
scratches behind his ear.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Oh wow. That’s nice. That’s very
          nice.

As Grace drifts off, Bub sighs with pleasure.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. GRACE'S ROOM - LATER

Seeing Grace is asleep, Bub carefully shimmies out from under
her arm and quietly steps down onto the floor. He goes to the
backpack and unzips the pocket.

He fishes out the pendant. It’s purple stone glimmers in the
dim light.

He slips it into a pocket on his vest and zips it shut. He
moves to the door, glancing back one last time at Grace.

                    BUB
          Good luck, kid.

BZZZZZ.

BZZZZZ.
                                                          79.


Grace stirs as her cell phone vibrates on her night table.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Crap!

Bub freezes as she wakes up and looks at her phone.

INSERT ON A TEXT from Lindsay:

“Hey, it’s Linsday from school. If ur awake come meet us at
Cody’s house. 233 Lester Court. Should b fun.”

Grace considers for a beat, then looks at Bub.

                    GRACE
          Wanna sneak out?

                    BUB
          I was about to!


INT. CODY’S BASEMENT - NIGHT

Lindsay escorts Bub and Grace down the stairs to a finished
basement rec room where Cody and Owen are playing quarters
with red Solo cups.

NOTE: We never see any of the teens actually drinking beer.

                    CODY
          There she is! The mascot killer!

                    OWEN
          And she brought her dog. Man, you
          bring that thing everywhere.

                    BUB
          Not like I had a choice.

                    LINDSAY
          He can play with Barf.

                    BUB
          Huh?

                    CODY
          Barf! Come!

An overweight yellow lab, BARF, shambles in with a hard
rubber bone in his mouth that he begins chomping on.

                    BARF
          ‘Sup?
                                                         80.


                    BUB
          Your name is “Barf”?

                    BARF
          He was eight when he named me. The
          joke hasn’t aged well.

As Grace joins the others, Bub sits impatiently with the lab.

                    BUB
          Is there any way out of here?

                    BARF
          No. I would’ve found it.

Bub watches him slobber over the fake bone for a beat.

                    BUB
          What are you doing there?

                    BARF
          Eating my bone.

                    BUB
          You know you’re not actually eating
          that, right?

                       BARF
          Sure I am.

                    BUB
          It’s hard rubber. You’ll never get
          through it.

                    BARF
          I’ll get through it.

                    BUB
          I promise you won’t.

                    BARF
          Can you give me a break? This bone
          is all I have.

                    BUB
          What about... Cody over there?

                     BARF
          He doesn’t really play with me. His
          dad got me to try and teach him
          responsibility. But I don’t think
          it worked.
                                                        81.


                    BUB
          What, is he a bad kid?

                    BARF
          He gets in trouble a lot.
              (re: Owen and Linsday)
          All of them do.

                    BUB
          Is that right?

He looks over at Grace, perhaps a little concerned for her.

                    OWEN
              (to Grace)
          Why would you wanna leave Chicago
          and move to this dump?

                    GRACE
          Believe me. I didn’t want to.

                    CODY
          Once my grandma dies, I’m gonna get
          a stack and move to Vegas.

                    GRACE
          What about school?

The others laugh.

                    GRACE (CONT'D)
          So, what do you guys do for fun
          around here?

                    OWEN
              (re: the drinking game)
          Pretty much this. And train
          dodging.

                    GRACE
          Train dodging?

                    CODY
          That’s why they call it Hopewell
          Junction. This place gets more
          trains than Grand Central.

                     LINDSAY
          You should come tomorrow. It’s
          super fun.

                    GRACE
              (uncertain)
          Maybe.
                                                           82.


                    OWEN
          Less chit-chat. More drinky.

Lindsay offers Grace a Solo cup.

                    BUB
              (to Barf)
          What’s in there?

                    BARF
          It ain’t water. I know ‘cause I
          tried it once.

Bub’s hackles go up. His new connection with Grace has
triggered a long-dormant protective instinct.

                    BUB
          Grace! Don’t drink that.

The kids look over at the barking dog.

                    OWEN
          What’s with him?

                    GRACE
          I don’t know.

Grace reluctantly takes the cup, but before she can sip,

                    BUB
          You’re better than these goons. PUT
          THE CUP DOWN!

Bub’s bark becomes even louder.

                    CODY
          He’s gonna wake up my dad.

                    GRACE
              (embarrassed)
          Quiet, Lucky!

                    BUB
          What do I need to do to get you out
          of here?

He starts to SCOOT his butt along the rug.

                    LINDSAY
          EWWW!
                                                        83.


                     BARF
              (to Bub)
          It’s a good rug for that, huh? Got
          some grit.

                    CODY
              (to Grace)
          What’s your dog’s problem?

                    GRACE
          Lucky, stop!

Cody tosses a couch cushion at Bub. But Bub dodges it and
then tears into it, pulling out stuffing.

                    BUB
          Time to go, Grace!

He barks some more.

                      GRACE
          Shhh!

                    BUB
          Oh, I’ll “shhh” all right. I’m
          gonna “shhh” all over this carpet.

He squats down, preparing to poop.

                      CODY
          NO!

Grace puts down the cup and jumps to her feet. A cup of beer
spills onto her sleeve.

She grabs Bub and stops him from defecating.

                    GRACE
          I don’t know why he’s acting like
          this. I should probably take him
          home.

                    BUB
          Yeah you should.

                    LINDSAY
          Well, come meet us tomorrow if you
          want.

                    CODY
          Maybe leave Lucky at home.
                                                         84.


                    OWEN
          You sure he’s an emotional support
          dog?

Grace looks down at Bub. She’s actually relieved he’s getting
her out of there.

                    GRACE
          Yeah, I think he is.

She takes his leash and leads him up the stairs.


EXT. PEÑA HOUSE - DAWN

Grace and Bub quietly sneak into the house as the sun begins
to rise.


INT. PEÑA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Grace tip-toes inside.

                      FRANCISCO (O.S.)
          Grace?

She turns to see her grandparents, in pajamas, sipping
coffee.

                    GRACE
          Grandma and grandpa.

                      BUB
          Oh, crap.

                    CARMEN
          Are you just coming home now?

                    FRANCISCO
          You were out all night?!

Before she can answer, Tomàs comes downstairs with Jenni.

                    TOMÀS
          What’s going on? Grace? What are
          you doing up? And dressed?

                    CARMEN
          Your daughter just came home.

                    TOMÀS
          What? Where the heck were you?
                                                         85.


                    GRACE
          Out with some friends. I didn’t do
          anything bad.

                    BUB
          Thanks to me.

                    CARMEN
              (sniffing)
          She smells like beer!

                    FRANCISCO
              (to Tomás)
          So, this is the kind of house you
          keep? You let your fifteen year-old
          daughter run around town?

                    TOMÀS
          She snuck out. I had no idea. She’s
          never done anything like this
          before.

                    CARMEN
          You’re her father. You’re supposed
          to know where she is.

                    TOMÀS
          Thanks, Carmen. I know that.

                    CARMEN
          I’m not sure you do.

                    TOMÀS
          Okay, girls, upstairs. Grace,
          you’re grounded.

                    JENNI
          But she’s gotta come to the talent
          show!

                     TOMÀS
          Fine. She can come to the show but
          that’s it.

                    GRACE
          Great. More punishment.

                    JENNI
          Hey.

The girls head upstairs. Grace looks back at Bub. They
exchange a sad look.
                                                        86.


                    BUB
          Sorry to leave you like this,
          Grace. But I gotta go.

As Tomàs continues to defend himself against Francisco and
Carmen. Bub quietly makes his way toward an open window.

He is just about to climb out when,

                    FRANCISCO (O.S.)
          Look at this. You can’t even keep
          your dog in the house.

Tomàs turns to see Bub halfway out the window.

                    BUB
              (to Francisco)
          Thats it. You’re on my “Shhh” list.

An exasperated Tomàs picks up the dog and sticks him in his
crate, locking it behind him.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Satan help me.


INT. VET'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM -DAY

Satan enters with Phobos and Morphos. Old Dr. Casey
approaches.

                    DR. CASEY
          Hello, there. If you’re here to
          pick up the cat, I’m afraid I’ve
          got some bad news.

                      SATAN
          What? No.

          How can I help you?

                    SATAN
              (eyeing his computer)
          I need you to examine my dogs. In
          another room.

                    DR. CASEY
          Uh, anything I’m looking for in
          particular?
                                                           87.


                       SATAN
          ...rabies?

                    DR. CASEY
          I can give them the shot. It’s a
          pretty painful one.

                    SATAN
          That’s fine.

                       PHOBOS
          Hey!

                    MORPHOS
          There’s no rabies in Hell!

The vet leads the two dogs into the exam room, leaving Satan
alone.

Satan crosses to the computer and searches the patient log
from two days ago. He scrolls down until he finds an entry:

“Male canine, Lucky, struck by vehicle.” Included is the
address of the Peña house.

                    SATAN
          Looks like the Peñas are about to
          feel the pain-ya.


INT. VET'S EXAM ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Satan walks in to find Dr. Casey holding an intimidating
needle over a terrified Phobos.

                    SATAN
          Phobos, Morphos, come!

                    DR. CASEY
          I haven’t given them the shot yet.

The two dogs look pleadingly at Satan. After a beat,

                       SATAN
          I’ll wait.

The dogs’ faces fall.

Jenni comes downstairs.

          Maybe I should drive.

                    TOMÀS
          Why?

                    FRANCISCO
          You’ve hit two dogs in as many
          days.

                     TOMÀS
          It was the same dog.
              (beat)
          Not that that makes it better...
          All right. You can drive if you
          want.

Grace comes downstairs looking upset.

                    GRACE
          Has anyone seen my pendant? It was
          in my bag but I can’t find it.

ANGLE ON BUB in his crate. Hearing this, he feels a slight
pang of guilt as he glances at the pocket in his vest.

                    CARMEN
          Maybe you lost it while you were
          out.

                    TOMÀS
          We’ll look for it when we get back.
          We’re late.

Feeling the bad vibes in the room, Jenni holds up her
ventriloquist dummy.

                    JENNI
              (Lulu’s voice)
          Hope you guys are ready to laugh!

                                                        89.


The front door closes.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          You’re killing me! You’re literally
          killing me.

He shoves his paw through the bars and tries to wiggle the
latch open, but he can’t reach.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          I can’t get it from inside.

His eyes scan the room, landing on an open BAG OF SUNFLOWER
SEEDS on a table. An idea strikes him.

He leans toward a wall vent and shouts:

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Hey, rat!
              (to himself)
          What’s his name?
              (yells)
          Sebastian?! Can you hear me?!


INTERCUT WITH:


INT. JENNI'S ROOM - SAME

Sebastian sits in his cage, manically scratching his ear with
his foot a million times. Bub’s voice comes through a vent in
the room.

                    SEBASTIAN
          That you, Lucky?!

                    BUB (O.S.)
          I need your help! You’ve gotta come
          down here and unlock something for
          me.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I’m on my way.

He gets in his wheel and starts running. Finally, he jumps
out and looks around.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          That’s right.
              (yells)
          I’m in a cage!
                                                           90.


                    BUB
          Can you get out of it? ‘Cause I’ve
          got seeds down here!

                    SEBASTIAN
              (perking up)
          Seeds?

                    BUB
          Big bag of ‘em. I’d say about three
          ounces of pure sunflower!

Sebastian’s whole demeanor changes. He’s a man possessed.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I’ll be right there!

Like a T-1000, the hamster SQUISHES its face between the bars
of the cage. He grunts sharply as his skull and body compress
impossibly, allowing him to slip out of the cage.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          Seeds.

He scampers off.

The hamster runs down the hall and LEAPS from the top of the
stairs, bouncing and rolling down the steps. He lands
clumsily.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          Seeds.

He tears into the living room and sees Bub in his crate.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          Hi, Lucky. Where are the seeds?

                     BUB
              (nods)
          Over there, but first you need to
          unlock my--

But Sebastian is off, leapfrogging up onto the table and
running right into the bag of seeds.

Shells fly out of the bag as the hamster gorges himself,
moaning in ecstasy.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Come on, man! You can do that
          after!
                                                          91.


                    SEBASTIAN
          Papa just needs a taste, then I’ll
          be right with you!


EXT. STREET - SAME

Satan and the dogs walk down the middle of the street,
scanning addresses.

They arrive outside the Peñas’ home.

                    SATAN
          We’re here.


INT. PEÑA HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - SAME

At last, Sebastian has finished the bag of seeds. He stumbles
out, slipping on his own discarded shells. He’s groggy from
his “fix.”

                    SEBASTIAN
              (slurring)
          Whew. Papa needs to lie down.

                    BUB
          NO! Papa needs to unlock this cage.
          Now!

                    SEBASTIAN
          All right, all right...

He takes a step and FALLS off the table, landing on the rug.
He cracks up laughing as he rolls around on his back.

                    BUB
          It’s not that funny. Come on.

Still giggling, the hamster comes over to the cage.

Through the FROSTED FRONT DOOR WINDOW we can see the outline
of Satan standing outside.

Sebastian climbs the front of the crate and unhooks the
latch. Bub bursts out.

                    SEBASTIAN
              (woozy)
          There you go. Have I told you that
          I really respect you? You’re like a
          brother to me.

The DOORBELL RINGS.
                                                        92.


                       BUB
          Shh!

The front doorknob jiggles as Satan tries it from outside.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          I gotta go.

As Bub runs toward the rear of the house, Satan peers through
the kitchen window.


EXT. PEÑA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Just as Bub is about to cross into his view, Satan turns at
the sound of...

                       KAREN
          Excuse me!

Karen has marched across the street to confront this
suspicious stranger and his dogs. She films the whole
interaction on her phone.

                    KAREN (CONT'D)
          Can I help you?

                    SATAN
          We’re fine.

                    KAREN
          I don’t think you are fine. I can
          tell when someone is casing a
          joint.

                    SATAN
          This is none of your business.

                    KAREN
          Wrong again. This is exactly my
          business. Now, can I see some
          identification, please?

                    MORPHOS
          What’s this chick’s problem?

Karen reacts to the dog’s growl.

                    KAREN
          And those dogs need to be leashed.
          That’s it. I’m calling the sheriff.
          And I’m placing you under citizen’s
          arrest until he arrives.
                                                        93.


EXT. PEÑA HOUSE, BACKYARD - SAME

Bub climbs out an open window and leaves the house. Sebastian
waves down from the window.

                    SEBASTIAN
          So long, Lucky! I hope we meet
          again someday.

                    BUB
          I wouldn’t hope for that if I were
          you.


EXT. PEÑA HOUSE - SAME

In the front yard, Satan is still with Karen. Phobos suddenly
notices Bub walking a few dozen yards down the street.

                    PHOBOS
          Boss, look!

Hearing Phobos bark, Satan looks.

                    SATAN
          It’s Bub! Bub, wait!

He moves to go but Karen steps in his path. Bub, not hearing
him, disappears around the corner.

                    KAREN
              (dialing her phone)
          You are in my custody, sir.

                    SATAN
              (getting pissed)
          Move! Do you have any idea who I
          am?

                    KAREN
          Nope. Don’t care. We’re all the
          same under the eyes of the law.
              (into phone)
          Hello, Sheriff Rogers?

                    SATAN
          I AM THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS!

                    KAREN
          And I am the head of the
          Neighborhood Watch!
              (into phone)
                    (MORE)
                                                           94.

                    KAREN (CONT'D)
          I’ve got a man shouting at me and
          saying he’s the devil. I feel
          physically threatened.

                    SATAN
          Get out of my way!

As Satan and the dogs attempt to push past her, she grabs the
pepper spray from her holster and SPRAYS SATAN AND BOTH DOGS
IN THE EYES.

                      SATAN (CONT'D)
          AGGGHHHH!

                    KAREN
          Can’t take the heat, “Satan”?

Clutching his eyes, Satan runs off. Morphos and Phobos
stumble behind him.


INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY

The show is in progress. A 10th grade BOY is just finishing
his magic performance. Tomàs sits beside Francisco, Carmen
and Grace. His in-laws whisper-argue with Tomàs with Grace
stuck in the middle.

                    CARMEN
          None of this would’ve happened if
          you’d just stayed in the city like
          we asked.

                    TOMÀS
          I told you. There were no jobs in
          the city. They filled mine when I
          left to take care of Isabel.

The crowd of parents applauds. Jenni comes on stage with
Lulu.

                    JENNI
          Hi, everyone. I’m Jenni Peña.
              (Lulu voice)
          And I’m Lulu. I sure hope this show
          goes well. Knock on wood.

The dummy knocks on her own head.

                     FRANCISCO
          You don’t need to work, Tomàs. We
          told you we’d take care of you and
          the girls.
                                                        95.


                    TOMÀS
          I’m their father. I can take care
          of them myself.

The argument is growing louder. Audience members begin to
take notice.

From the stage, Jenni notices her family arguing. She does
her best to stay focused.

                    JENNI
              (Lulu voice)
          Hey, Jenni. What kind of music is a
          balloon scared of?
              (normal voice)
          That’s easy. Pop music.

                    CARMEN
              (to Tomàs)
          Can you take care of them? Look
          what’s happening to Grace. This
          isn’t who she is. The girl is lost.

                    TOMÀS
          And do you think you’re helping
          when all you do is tear down her
          father?!

                    GRACE
          You know I’m right here?! And
          you’re the ones who need help!
              (getting up)
          I can’t take this anymore. I’m
          going outside.

                    TOMÀS
          Grace, wait!

Jenni watches as Grace storms out of the auditorium. She sits
on stage, her emotions boiling up to the surface. All these
months of putting on a brave face have finally taken their
toll.

                    JENNI
              (shouting)
          I hate this!

The audience watches, uncertain. Is this part of the act?
Jenni pulls Lulu off her arm and shouts at the doll.
                                                        96.


                    JENNI (CONT'D)
          I try to make everybody happy! I
          try to be positive and never
          complain and see the bright side of
          everything! Well, guess what? There
          is no bright side!

She throws Lulu to the floor.

                    JENNI (CONT'D)
          There’s just me and my stupid
          family and this stupid doll!

As Tomàs, the grandparents and the rest of the audience watch
in silent shock, Jenni stomps repeatedly on Lulu’s head,
DISLODGING HER JAW.

Jenni screeches like a wild animal as she PULLS THE ARMS OFF
LULU. She then picks up her stool and bashes Lulu until she
is no more than a pulp of splinters and stuffing.

She stands there for a beat, panting in the spotlight. Then,
she sits in the pile of Lulu’s remains and hangs her head.

                    JENNI (CONT'D)
          I’m finished!

There’s a beat before the audience suddenly ERUPTS IN
APPLAUSE.


EXT. RAIL YARD - SHORT TIME LATER

Still on edge, Grace walks into a mostly derelict train yard
where Owen, Lindsay and Cody are hanging out on rusty lounge
chairs and discarded crates.

                     LINDSAY
          You made it!
              (then)
          You okay? You look a little--

                       GRACE
          Miserable?

                       LINDSAY
          Yeah.

                    GRACE
          That’s how I’m feeling.
                                                        97.


                    OWEN
          Congratulations. You are now
          officially a resident of Hopewell
          Junction.

                    CODY
          And your timing is perfect.

He nods to a freight train engine approaching from a quarter
mile off.

                    GRACE
          How does this work exactly?

                    CODY
          Watch and learn.

He steps up onto the tracks. The train sounds its horn as it
nears.

                    GRACE
          Isn’t this kinda dangerous?

                    CODY
          Only if you don’t jump in time.

Cody does a Fortnite dance on the tracks as the train speeds
closer. At the last moment, he jumps out of the way and the
train whizzes by.

                    LINDSAY
          I’m gonna give that an eight out of
          ten.

                    CODY
          Come on! It got up to the Texaco
          sign!

They hear another train off in the distance.

                    OWEN
              (to Grace)
          What do you say, Noob? You wanna
          show him how it’s done?

Feeling numb and reckless, she shrugs.

                     GRACE
          Why not?

She steps onto the tracks as the other kids cheer her on.
                                                           98.


EXT. STREET - SAME

Bub runs down the road, heading to the tar pit park, he
passes the rail yard. Glancing over, he’s surprised to see
Grace standing on the train tracks.

                    BUB
          Grace? The hell’s she doing?

Concerned, Bub heads in her direction.


EXT. RAIL YARD - CONTINUOUS

Taking a cue from Cody, Grace does her own little dance on
the tracks.

But as she does, her foot slips and her shoe becomes caught
between the rail and the tie. She tries to pull it out but
its lodged in there.

                    GRACE
          Guys? I think my foot’s caught.

The train continues to bear down on them.

                    LINDSAY
          Very funny.

                    GRACE
          No, I’m serious!

The kids hurry over and try to pry her foot loose, to no
avail.

                    CODY
          It’s really stuck!

                    OWEN
          Take her shoe off!

                    LINDSAY
              (trying)
          I can’t!

Increasingly panicked, Grace looks up at the approaching
train. The engineer blows the horn repeatedly.

                     GRACE
          Help me!

Just then, Bub arrives. He jumps onto the tracks and digs,
like only a dog can, into the ballast beneath Grace’s shoe.
                                                         99.


With the train so close, the other kids freak out and
retreat. But Bub stays the course until...

                    BUB
          Got it! Come on!

He FREES HER FOOT AND THEY JUMP OUT OF THE WAY just as the
train reaches them.

As Grace and Bub catch their breath on the ground.

                       GRACE
          Thank you.

                    BUB
          You’re welcome. Do me a favor and
          don’t stand in front of any more
          trains, you dummy.

She throws her arms around him.

                    GRACE
          I love you.

Words Bub didn’t even know he wanted to hear. But they hit
home. He sighs.

                    BUB
          I’m out of time, kid. I’m sorry.

And with that, he slips out of her grasp and runs off,
leaving her confused. After a beat,

                    CODY
          That’s definitely a nine out of
          ten.

Grace just looks at the threesome. She’s officially done with
these idiots.


EXT. TAR PIT PARK - MINUTES LATER

Bub hurries into the park, passing the dinosaur statues and
reaching the edge of the tar pits.

He unzips the pouch on his vest with his teeth and pulls out
Grace’s pendant. But as he does, the pendant opens and he
finds himself looking at the photo of Grace and her mom.
                                                         100.


                     BUB
              (torn)
          I’m sure she’s got other priceless
          artifacts her mom gave her before
          she died...

He holds the necklace over the tar which takes on an
UNEARTHLY GLOW. But he can’t bring himself to drop it in.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Drop it, Bub. What’s wrong with
          you?

                    SATAN (O.S.)
          Bub!

The dog turns to see Satan, Morphos and Phobos have caught up
with him. Bub’s eyes go wide with joy.

                    BUB
          Satan!

                    SATAN
          We’ve looked everywhere for you. I
          came up personally. And you know
          how I hate it up here.

Bub sets the pendant gently on a stone and runs toward Satan,
leaping up and licking him affectionately. But Satan shoves
him off.

                    SATAN (CONT'D)
          Ugh! What are you doing? Kissing
          me? That’s disgusting!

                    PHOBOS
          Yeah, that’s pretty gross, man.

                    BUB
              (to Satan)
          Aren’t you happy to see me? Didn’t
          you miss me?

                    SATAN
          That sort of thing may fly with the
          mortals, but I won’t tolerate any
          of that in Hell. Now, come on.
          Those people down there aren’t
          going to torture themselves.

He begins to lead a conflicted Bub toward the tar pit.

                    GRACE (O.S.)
          There you are!
                                                       101.


He turns to find Grace has caught up to him.

                    BUB
          Grace!

                    GRACE
          Come on, boy. Let’s go home.

                    SATAN
          Who are you?

                    GRACE
          I’m his owner.

                     SATAN
          I’m his owner. I have been since
          before the dawn of man.
              (then)
          Now let’s go, Bub. We’re going into
          the tar pit.

Satan shows Bub the amethyst ring he wears.

                    GRACE
          Okay, you just seem like a crazy
          person.

Bub stands between the two of them, not sure what to do.

                    SATAN
          You’re not seriously considering
          staying with her. You’d be giving
          up boundless power and immortality.

                    BUB
          Yeah, but... she loves me.

                    MORPHOS
          Can you believe this guy?

                    PHOBOS
          And he says we’re the dumb ones.

Bub turns his back on Satan and starts walking toward Grace.

                    SATAN
          He’s not thinking straight.
          Hellhounds, take him!

Morphos and Phobos charge Bub, tackling him to the ground.
Grace runs to his aid but Satan grabs her.

The hellhounds square off against Bub.
                                                          102.


                    BUB
              (to Satan)
          Let her go!

He tries to run to Grace but is overtaken by the dogs. He’s
outmatched by the two.

                    MORPHOS
          Not so tough here on Earth, are
          you?

                    PHOBOS
          Face it, Bub. You’re outnumbered.

Suddenly, Bub remembers something. He lets out a HOWL that
echoes over the town.

After a moment, we hear a RETURN HOWL.

                    MORPHOS
          What is that?

                    BUB
          Some friends I made on the inside.

                    PHOBOS
          Inside of what?

All at once, the alpha dogs from the shelter, Apricot,
Snuggles and Heidi burst out of the woods to Bub’s aid.

                    APRICOT
          You called?

                    BUB
              (to the hellhounds)
          Fellas, let me introduce you to
          Heidi, Snuggles and Apricot.
              (realizing)
          They’re tougher than they sound.

The big dogs charge at Morphos and Phobos, trouncing the
hellhounds.

There follows an epic battle that ranges over the backs and
tails of the artificial dinosaurs.

Finally, the dog fight spills out onto the street.

ANGLE ON a pickup truck speeding toward the dogs. The DRIVER
spots them and SWERVES to avoid hitting them. The truck goes
up onto the grass and SLAMS INTO the largest of the fake
dinosaurs, a brachiosaurus.
                                                          103.


It teeters, then falls...

Grace sees where the statue is headed: directly for Bub.

                      GRACE
          Look out!

Too late. The head of the dinosaur lands on top of Bub,
knocking him down.

                      SATAN
          NO!

The dogs stop fighting as they see what has happened. Grace
runs over to Bub and pulls him free. He’s not moving.

                    GRACE
          Come on, Lucky! Wake up!

But Bub is still. She listens for a heartbeat but hears
nothing.

                    SATAN
          Who will I replace him with?!
              (to Phobos and Morphos)
          Not you fools.

Morphos and Phobos exchange a hurt look. But Grace is only
focused on Bub.

                    GRACE
          You don’t understand, boy. I can’t
          lose you too. Please come back.
          Please.

Grace begins to cry. The full weight of her mom, the move,
everything is now bearing down on her.

Heidi, Snuggles and Apricot maintain a respectful distance as
they too mourn the loss of Bub.

Satan regards the scene with nothing more than annoyance. He
confirms he has the amethyst ring on his finger.

                    SATAN
          What a waste. Now he’s stuck in
          heaven.
              (to the hellhounds)
          Get in the tar. We’re going home.

As the dogs reluctantly join Satan and walk toward the pit,
Grace buries her head in Bub’s fur.

Suddenly, the dog TAKES A BREATH.
                                                       104.


                    GRACE
          Lucky?!

Bub opens his eyes and looks up at her.

                    BUB
          I feel like I got hit by a
          dinosaur.

                    GRACE
          Lucky!

                    BUB
          You were right about your mom,
          Grace. She’s pretty awesome. She
          told me I had more work to do down
          here. But of course, you don’t
          understand a word I’m saying.

She hugs him, overjoyed.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
          Or maybe you do.

Without warning, Bub is yanked from Grace’s arms by Satan.

                    GRACE
          Hey!

                    SATAN
          He belongs to me.

                    BUB
          Put me down! I don’t want to go!

But Satan marches forward. The tar, reacting to his black
amethyst ring, begins to glow again.

Satan steps into the tar as Grace grabs hold of Bub’s hind
legs.

                    SATAN
              (to hellhounds)
          Sic her!

But Phobos and Morphos, who have yet to enter the pit, look
conflicted. Deep beneath their tough exteriors, they too have
hearts.

Satan shoves Grace back. She falls, momentarily stunned as
Satan takes another step into the tar.
                                                       105.


                    SATAN (CONT'D)
              (to Bub)
          This is what you were meant to do!

                    BUB
          Not anymore it isn’t.

Bub bites Satan’s hand. He recoils, releasing Bub and falling
back into the tar.

                     SATAN
          NOOO!

He disappears into the black ooze. It’s ominously silent.

                    MORPHOS
          You know he’s gonna come back for
          you.

                    BUB
          I doubt it.

And with that, Bub spits something out onto the ground. It’s
SATAN’S BLACK AMETHYST RING. Morphos and Phobos gape at Bub.

                    PHOBOS
          Did you just--?

                    BUB
          Kill Satan? Looks that way.

                    MORPHOS
          I guess that means we’re--

                     PHOBOS
          Useless?

                    BUB
          It means you’re free.

The hellhounds look at each other, confused.

                    MORPHOS
          I don’t really know what a free dog
          does.

                    APRICOT
          Come with us. We can teach you.

                    SNUGGLES
          We roam the land, sleeping whenever
          we want, eating garbage and
          sniffing butts.
                                                       106.


                    PHOBOS
          It sounds amazing.

                    HEIDI
          You have no idea.

With that, the five dogs happily bound off into the woods.

Grace gets to her feet and sees Bub pick up her pendant from
the rock he’d set it on. He brings it back to her.

                    GRACE
          My pendant!

                    BUB
          Sorry about that. Not exactly
          something an emotional support
          animal would do.

                    GRACE
          You ready to go home?

                    BUB
          I’ve been waiting my whole life. I
          just didn’t know it.

Dog and girl head out of the park together.

                    BUB (CONT'D)
              (to himself)
          I hope they don’t clean out that
          tar pit too often...


INT. PEÑA HOUSE - LATER

Bub and Grace enter to find the rest of the family waiting.

                    CARMEN
          She’s here!

Tomàs runs over and hugs Grace.

                     TOMÀS
          You can’t keep disappearing on us
          like that!

                    GRACE
          It’s the last time. I promise.

                    FRANCISCO
              (to Tomàs)
          Moving here was a mistake. It’s
          time to bring the girls home!
                                                       107.


                    GRACE
          No, Grandpa. This is home. As long
          as Dad, Jenni and I are together,
          we’ll always be home.

Bub barks. Grace smiles.

                    GRACE (CONT'D)
          And Lucky. Lucky’s part of this
          family now too.

The adults are all surprised by her earnestness. They haven’t
seen this side of her since Isabel died.

                    GRACE (CONT'D)
              (to her grandparents)
          But you guys need to do your part.
          I know your hearts are in the right
          place but you gotta give Dad a
          break. Mom loved him more than
          anything. She’d want you to do the
          same.

Francisco and Carmen nod, humbled by this.

                    CARMEN
          Is this really what you girls want?
          You want to stay here?

Grace looks at Jenni who nods, then at Tomàs.

                    GRACE
          I hear there’s a pretty good music
          program at the school.

Tomàs gives her a warm smile.

                    TOMÀS
          By the way, your sister won first
          prize at the talent show.

                    JENNI
              (proudly)
          They thought my meltdown was part
          of the act.

                    BUB
          Oh, man. I missed your meltdown? I
          knew it was coming.

                    TOMÀS
          Since we’re staying, how about we
          start fixing this place up?
                                                         108.


He gestures to the still paint-splattered living room.

                    TOMÀS (CONT'D)
          Girls, grab paint and brushes.
          Francisco and Carmen, maybe you can
          find a carpet cleaner?

                    JENNI
          What are you gonna do?

                    TOMÀS
          I need to call my students’ parents
          and convince them I’m not a serial
          killer.

                    BUB
          Speaking of serial killers, I
          wonder what Hell is gonna be like
          now that the big boss is gone.

We MOVE DOWN THROUGH THE FLOOR, through miles of earth until
we land in


INT. HELL, FILING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dennis, the scowling C.E.O. from the beginning of the movie,
sticks a folder in a filing cabinet. We PULL BACK to see it
was the last of the thousands and thousands of piles he had
to file.

                    DENNIS
          I’m done.
              (nothing)
          Hello?

He tentatively opens the door of the room and peeks outside.

                    DENNIS (CONT'D)
          I finished filing! Anybody here?

No answer. He shrugs and slips out the door, as we

CUT TO BLACK.



                             THE END
