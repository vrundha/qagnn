EXT. VARIOUS SHOTS OF YPSILANTI, MICHIGAN - 2054 - DAWN

A TYPEWRITER clicks as we see shots of dawn breaking over
Ypsilanti, a Midwestern college town.

- A RACCOON tries to break in to an AUTOMATED TRASH CAN.
The trash can slams its own lid and wheels itself away.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Dear Dr Glundenstein, I write with
             good news: I have not yet been
             incinerated! Nonetheless, so very
             much has happened that I have no
             idea where to begin.

- A US MAIL DRONE drops PACKAGES on two consecutive
doorsteps, and the third one in to a garden pond.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Ha! Kidding! The correct place to
             begin is at the beginning, in our
             town of Ypsilanti, Michigan.

- A MUSEUM’s lawn displays a B-24 BOMBER and a PRIUS.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             This seems auspicious as so many
             incredible things - including the
             gracefully murderous B-24 bomber
             and the short-lived architectural
             vogue for phallic water towers...

- YPSILANTI’S PHALLIC WATER TOWER. A DISPLAY shows the
current price of water. It creeps up as we look at it.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             ...started out in Ypsilanti!

- A SELF-DRIVING TRASH TRUCK lifts up the now misplaced
trash can, strews trash all over the road and continues on.
A RACCOON FAMILY emerge to feast.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Not for nothing is Ypsilanti known
             as ‘The Hoboken of the Midwest’!


INT. BEDROOM - JARED’S HOUSE - PLEASANT OAKS - PRE-DAWN

In an overly immaculate bedroom, a clock reads 0403am.

Next to the clock we see a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of an Asian
woman (50s) wearing a lab coat, PROF FENG.

Jared - 40s, pajamas - wakes, checks the clock and sighs.

He sees an ORANGE CAT staring at him from a dresser.
                                                           2.



INT. BATHROOM - JARED’S HOUSE - DAY

In an immaculate bathroom, Jared brushes his teeth.

                         TOOTHBRUSH
             Move brush to right rear quadrant.


INT. KITCHEN - JARED’S HOUSE - PLEASANT OAKS - DAY

In an immaculate kitchen, Jared pours a BROWN MEAL
SUBSTITUTE into a large glass and a small glass.

                         JARED
             Happy birthday to me!

Jared clinks the glasses together, then drinks the large
glass and gives the cat the small glass.


EXT. JARED’S HOUSE - PLEASANT OAKS - DAY

As Jared exits, his neighbor, MRS LARSON (40s) and her
daughter JESSICA (8) are emerging for the school run.

                         JARED
             Good morning, Mrs Larson! Good
             morning, Jessica Larson!

                         JESSICA
             Hi, Jared. How are you?

                         JARED
             Thank you for asking! Today is
             actually-

                         MRS LARSON
             Jessica! We don’t talk to bots.

                         JESSICA
             I don’t want to hurt his feelings.

                         MRS LARSON
             He doesn’t have feelings.

                         JARED
             Your mother is right, Jessica. I
             have no feelings whatsoever!

The Larsons head off on their ELECTRONIC SCOOTERS.


EXT./INT. SHUTTLE BUS - STREETS OF YPSILANTI - DAY

Jared watches the scenes from the bus window:

- KIDS walk to school chaperoned by TINY DRONES.
                                                             3.



- JOGGERS wear shirts that display their speed: 6mph etc.

- A YO SUSHI-STYLE CONVEYOR BELT that runs in and out of a
PET STORE shows the animals on sale today.

- A BILLBOARD for a no-win-no-fee lawyer reads 'DID A BOT
STEAL YOUR JOB? CALL NOW FOR A FREE CONSULTATION. 96% OF
OUR CASES END IN COMPENSATION AND INCINERATION!'


EXT. MEDICAL BUILDING - MAIN STREET, YPSILANTI - DAY

An LED sign outside reads:

YPSILANTI MEDICAL AND DENTAL (B) CLINIC

Jared arrives as DR GLUNDENSTEIN (50s, weary) does too.

                         JARED
             Good morning, Dr Glundenstein!

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Hi, Jared. How was your weekend?

                         JARED
             It was wonderful! I exercised,
             consumed an appropriate number of
             calories and spent the correct
             amount of time in standby mode to
             ensure I am refreshed for the
             upcoming week! How was yours?

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Let's just say, don't ever get
             married.

                         JARED
             Ha!

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             What?

                         JARED
             I assumed you were being hilarious.
             After all, you have been married
             three times, so it seems to be a
             recurring error!

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             I died so others may live. Don't
             make the same mistake as me.

                         JARED
             Ha! Do not worry, I will not be
             getting married, because marriage
             is utterly illogical.
                                                              4.



                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             That's what I love about you,
             Jared. There's never any bullshit.

                         JARED
             Yes! And speaking of bullshit,
             today is my birthday! This data is
             only useful to me so I know when to
             retire, but I know humans consider
             it somehow important.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Well, happy birthday.

                         JARED
             Thank you! That's very kind!


INT. DENTAL CLINIC - YPSILANTI MEDICAL BUILDING - DAY

Jared lays out DRILLS. Assistant ANGELA (40) bustles in.

                         JARED
             Good morning, Angela! As you are
             late, I took the liberty of doing
             your prep work. So please send in-

                         ANGELA
             Jesus Christ, Jared. I haven’t even
             had my coffee yet.

                         JARED
             My sincere apologies! Please send
             in a patient once you feel
             sufficiently caffeinated.


INT. DENTAL CLINIC - YPSILANTI MEDICAL BUILDING - DAY

Angela sips coffee and quietly sings along to the song 'If
You Like Pina Coladas'.

                         ANGELA
             If you like piña coladas
             And getting caught in the rain
             If you're not into yoga
             If you have half a brain

A NERVOUS PATIENT sits in the chair. Jared - now wearing an
operating headset - looms over him.

                         JARED
             As this is your first time with a
             bot dentist, allow me to put you at
             ease with some amusing repartee.
                         (MORE)
                                                              5.


                         JARED (cont'd)
             You can think of me as a microwave
             oven with feet, or a toaster with a
             heart! Of course, I mean a heart
             merely as in a mechanical pump, not
             a repository of emotions!

The patient tries to get up. Jared stops him.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             But rest assured our lack of
             empathy is the reason we bots make
             excellent dentists. So please sit
             back, open wide and say ‘Aaaaah’!


EXT. TRIDGE - YPSILANTI - DAY

At the TRIDGE - a three-pointed bridge - Jared sits down on
a bench beside a WOMAN.

                         JARED
             ‘Tridge’ is such a hilarious pun
             for a three-pointed bridge!

The woman gives him a look. Jared takes a DOUGHNUT from a
Tupperware box, inserts a SPARKLER and lights it.

                         WOMAN
             What are you doing?

                         JARED
             Celebrating my birthday by setting
             light to something inserted in a
             substance containing an inordinate
             number of nutritionally-valueless
             calories.

                         WOMAN
             Why?

                         JARED
             To seem as reassuringly human as
             possible!

The woman gets up and moves to another bench, where she
starts complaining about Jared to the STRANGER on it.

Jared watches them, then looks around. Everyone else -
JOGGERS, COUPLES, PARK WORKERS, DOGS - has a companion.

Jared watches as the sparkler slowly fizzles itself out.

And then abruptly jerks his head, as if he has been shot.

We hear the TYPEWRITER start to click.
                                                            6.



                         JARED (V.O.)
             And that, Dr Glundenstein, was when
             it all began. The number 1957026
             appeared unprompted in my Number
             Cloud. Of course, I tried a soft
             reset.

Jared blinks his eyes several times.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             When that did not work, I naturally
             attempted a hard reset.

Jared now screws up his eyes several times.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             But that did not work either. I had
             malfunctioned!


INT. DENTAL CLINIC - YPSILANTI MEDICAL BUILDING - DAY

Jared sets TISSUES on the desk then uses the INTERCOM.

                         JARED
             Could you please step in here?

An ANGRY SIGH over the intercom, then Angela appears.

                         ANGELA
             What?

                         JARED
             I have malfunctioned and must go to
             the Bureau of Robotics and be
             wiped. Tomorrow it will be as if we
             have never met before.

                         ANGELA
             Okay?

                         JARED
             This will therefore be our last
             chance to reminisce about all the
             collegiate times we have shared.

Jared offers the tissues. Angela shakes her head.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             Thank you for being so strong.

We see that Angela simply does not give a shit.


INT./EXT. DRIVERLESS UBER - FREEWAY - EVENING

The driverless uber's steering wheel turns spontaneously.
                                                              7.



Jared sits in the back, happily undaunted.


INT. WAITING ROOM - BUREAU OF ROBOTICS - EVENING

It is the DMV, but full of MALFUNCTIONING BOTS:

- A PERSONAL TRAINER BOT performs jumping jacks.

- A PARAMEDIC BOT is using a stethoscope inappropriately.

- A UNIFORMED HOSTESS BOT is endlessly repeating:

                         HOSTESS BOT
             Hi, I’m Melissa, I’m a bot! Hi I'm
             Melissa, I'm a bot. Hi, I'm-

Jared enters, takes a number and a seat, and waits.


INT. BRIDGES’ OFFICE - BUREAU OF ROBOTICS - EVENING

Jared sits across from INSPECTOR BRIDGES (40s) who is
filling out paperwork while watching a brutal football game
on TV featuring the EMU Eagles.

                         BRIDGES
             Oh come on! Watch that guy! Ouch!
             That one had to hurt.

The BOT PLAYER is loaded on a stretcher. The crowd cheer as
a CLEAN-CUT NEW BOT PLAYER enthusiastically takes his
place.

The name tag on Bridges’ shirt says ‘CHIEF INSPECTOR ANIL
GUPTA.’

                         JARED
             Excuse me, Chief Inspector Gupta-

                         BRIDGES
             It’s Inspector Bridges.

                         JARED
             Er, are you sure?

                         BRIDGES
             I spilled my lunch, so the Chief
             lent me his spare shirt. Why are
             you here?

                         JARED
             Because I am malfunctioning.

                         BRIDGES
             Yeah? What’s the problem?
                                                              8.



                         JARED
             A rogue number has appeared in my
             Number Cloud.

                         BRIDGES
             Have you tried turning yourself off
             and on again?

                         JARED
             A biological computer can no more
             turn itself off than a human brain!
             It’s true our circuits can
             sometimes become overheated, but-

                         BRIDGES
             It was a joke. Jesus. Why do I even
             bother? You’re a bot.

                         JARED
             Yes! A malfunctioning bot.

Bridges points outside to where the personal trainer bot is
laying on the ground doing crunches and the paramedic bot
is attempting to perform chest compressions on him.

                         BRIDGES
             Those are malfunctioning bots.
                   (At TV.)
             Come on! Goddamit!

Bridges sighs, scribbles a FORM and hands it to Jared.

                         BRIDGES (cont'd)
             But fine. Second door on the left.


INT. TEST ROOM - BUREAU OF ROBOTICS - EVENING

Jared wears a DEVICE like an old-fashioned motorcycle
helmet covered in wires and flashing lights.

The lights stop and a COMPUTER spits out a PRINTOUT.


INT. OFFICE - BUREAU OF ROBOTICS - EVENING

The score shows the EMU Eagles are losing badly. The NEW
PLAYER who we saw come on now gets injured.

                         BRIDGES
             Goddamit!

Bridges now looks at the printout then up at Jared.

                         BRIDGES (cont'd)
             See? Our botscanner says you are
             fine.
                                                           9.



                         JARED
             Perhaps you should wipe me anyway?
             Just to be on the safe side?

                         BRIDGES
             Do you even know how many forms
             that involves? Look, go home and
             get a good night in standby mode.
             I’m sure the number will be gone by
             tomorrow.


INT. ELEVATOR - BUREAU OF ROBOTICS - DAY

Jared enters to find a BUREAU AGENT and the hostess bot.

Jared presses the '1' button. The doors close.

                         MELISSA
             Dining alone? Perhaps a seat at our
             bar? Or our communal table?

                         BUREAU AGENT
             Knock it off, already.

                         MELISSA
             Please forgive me. I am broken
             beyond economic repair! The sooner
             I am incinerated the better!

Jared checks the buttons: 1 and B are illuminated.

When the doors open on 1, Jared hurries out.


EXT. BUREAU OF ROBOTICS - NIGHT

As Jared scans his BARCODE - a small tattoo on his index
finger - on his driverless uber, he hears a RUMBLING.

He turns and sees the Bureau's chimney belch SMOKE.

Jared stares at the smoke. He is perturbed.


INT. BEDROOM - JARED'S HOUSE   - DAWN

Jared opens his eyes at 0403am. The cat meows at him.

                         JARED
             1956864. So the rogue number has
             decreased by 162.
                   (Cat meows.)
             Yes, 1956864 is indeed wholly
             divisible by 13!
                   (His eyes flicker.)

INT. DR GLUNDENSTEIN CLINIC ROOM - MEDICAL BUILDING - DAY

An ordinary medical office with an ANATOMICAL SKELETON,
weighing scales etc.

But the walls bear FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS of Ridley Scott,
James Cameron, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. A
shelf holds a TYPEWRITER and some EMU EAGLES memorabilia.

                         JARED (O.C.)
             ...and 1956864 is also divisible by
             32, the number of teeth in the
             human mouth! And when divided by 13
             and 32, it gives 4704 which is...

Jared sits in the chair opposite Dr Glundenstein.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             ...the number of working days until
             I retire and am incinerated. My
             rogue number therefore represents
             the number of teeth I still have to
             see over the course of my career!

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             And how do you feel about that?

                         JARED
             Ha! I don’t! Because I am a bot.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Well, how are you, otherwise? Are
             you sleeping okay?

                         JARED
             Bots do not sleep! We enter standby
             mode.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             But no problems there?

                         JARED
             None whatsoever. Except every
             morning I involuntarily emerge from
             standby mode at 403am.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             And have you lost any weight?

                         JARED
             Eight pounds. I don’t know why.
                                      11.



            DR GLUNDENSTEIN
So, you wake early every morning,
you have lost weight, and you are
ruminating about the mundanity of
your existence?

            JARED
That is an excellent summation! I
feel better already. Thank you.

            DR GLUNDENSTEIN
Jared, what would you say if I told
you you seem to be suffering from a
classic case of major depression?

            JARED
I would say, ‘Ha!’

            DR GLUNDENSTEIN
So my hypothesis is that you are
depressed. Yours is you cannot be.
Should we conduct an experiment?

            JARED
That would be most scientific!

            DR GLUNDENSTEIN
Good. So I want you to go and watch
a movie in a theater.

            JARED
Dr Glundenstein, theaters are
places for humans to experience
their precious feelings together in
the dark! If I was found there, I
would be incinerated. Anyway,
movies are about killer bots and-

            DR GLUNDENSTEIN
Old movies aren't about killer
bots.

            JARED
What? What are old movies?

            DR GLUNDENSTEIN
Movies that survived the Great
Crash because they were stored on
film.

            JARED
But if the Bureau of Robotics ever
found out I had-

            DR GLUNDENSTEIN
They wouldn't know if you go by
Automatic Greyhound.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN (cont'd)
             It takes the cheap roads so it
             doesn't require a barcode. And
             here, wear this.

Dr Glundenstein takes an EMU EAGLES cap from his shelf.

                         JARED
             Ha! This will be an incredible
             disguise! No logical bot would ever
             choose to wear a hat of a team as
             consistently hopeless as the East
             Michigan Eagles!

Dr Glundenstein writes something down and gives it to
Jared. Jared's eyes widen when he sees it.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             Detroit is where I was rapidly
             aged! Did I ever tell you that my
             mother, Professor Feng, spoke at
             our graduation?

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             You mentioned it, Jared, yes.

                         JARED
             Well, set it to five, I will go to
             Detroit and watch an old movie!

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             What is that, 'Set it to five'?

                         JARED
             It is how I express maximal
             enthusiasm! My operating system was
             designed for toasters, and they
             only go up to five.


EXT./INT. GREYHOUND - YPSILANTI - EVENING

Jared pulls his cap down as an AUTOMATIC GREYHOUND nears.

Jared boards and touches his BITCOIN - a device with a
digital display - against the reader.


EXT. AUTOMATIC GREYHOUND ON FREEWAY - EVENING

The bus is grungy with scuzzy seats and no driver.

It travels too fast, throwing Jared around.


EXT. AUTOMATIC GREYHOUND STATION - DETROIT - NIGHT

As he disembarks, Jared pauses by the steering wheel.
                                                             13.



                         JARED
             Thank you. I know you did the best
             job your programming permits.


EXT. TICKET BOOTH - MAJESTIC THEATER - DETROIT - NIGHT

A tumbledown old theater with a neon marquee.

Jared hands his BITCOIN to the CLERK, who touches it
against a machine then hands it back.


INT. FOYER - MAJESTIC THEATER - DETROIT - NIGHT

Jared stares at a display case of BUTTERY POPCORN, the warm
golden light bathing his face.


INT. AUDITORIUM - MAJESTIC THEATER - DETROIT - NIGHT

Carrying a BUCKET OF POPCORN, Jared enters the near-empty
auditorium and stares at the THREADBARE RED VELVET SEATS,
the BALCONIES, the CRUMBLING ALABASTER STATUES.

Taking as isolated a seat as possible, Jared tastes the
popcorn then pulls a face. It is like eating sawdust.

Yet he cannot resist another mouthful.

Jared eats handfuls of popcorn with increasing speed until
the lights dim and LOVE STORY starts: emotive piano and
RYAN O'NEAL staring out at a snowy Harvard field.

                         OLIVER (V.O. FROM SCREEN)
             What can you say about a twenty-
             five-year-old girl who died? That
             she was beautiful and brilliant?
             That she loved Mozart and Bach and
             the Beatles? And me?

Jared is baffled by this.

                                                  CUT TO:

Oliver and Jenny are argue-flirting in the library.

                         JENNY (ON SCREEN)
             I won't have coffee with you.

                         OLIVER (ON SCREEN)
             I wouldn’t ask you.

Jared is puzzled but intrigued.

                                                  CUT TO:
                                                            14.



Oliver and his father are having a heated argument.

                         OLIVER’S DAD (ON SCREEN)
             If you marry her now, I’ll not give
             you the time of day!

Jared looks concerned.

                                                  CUT TO:

Up on screen, Oliver and Jenny are reconciling.

                         OLIVER (ON SCREEN)
             Jenny, I'm sorry.

                         JENNY (ON SCREEN)
             Don’t. Love means never having to
             say you’re sorry.

Jared is bamboozled.

                                                  CUT TO:

Up on screen, Oliver talks to a serious-looking doctor.

                         OLIVER (ON SCREEN)
             Define ‘very sick’.

                            DOCTOR (ON SCREEN)
             She’s dying.

Jared is stunned. He gasps.

                                                  CUT TO:

Up on screen, Jenny lies dying in her hospital bed.

                         JENNY (ON SCREEN)
             Would you please hold me? I mean
             really hold me. Next to me.

A SINGLE TEAR rolls down Jared’s cheek.

                                                  CUT TO:

Oliver and his dad are outside the hospital.

                         OLIVER (ON SCREEN)
             Jenny’s dead.

                         OLIVER’S DAD (ON SCREEN)
             I’m sorry, love-

                         OLIVER (ON SCREEN)
             Love means never having to say
             you’re sorry.

TEARS stream down Jared’s face. He is oblivious to them.


INT. AUDITORIUM - MAJESTIC THEATER - NIGHT

As the house lights come up, Jared sees his shirt is wet.

He looks around, then up to the ceiling for a leak.


INT. RESTROOM - MAJESTIC THEATER - NIGHT

Jared stares at his puffy red eyes in the mirror.

He gingerly touches them. He is baffled.


INT. DR GLUNDENSTEIN'S ROOM - MEDICAL BUILDING - DAY

Jared sits opposite Dr Glundenstein.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             What did you think of the movie?

                         JARED
             What can you say about a twenty-
             five-year-old girl who died? That-

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             I’ve seen the movie, Jared. I’m
             asking if you felt anything?

                         JARED
             Ha! No, because I am a bot!

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Well, did anything unusual happen?

                         JARED
             I produced 52mls of tears. It must
             have been allergies.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Jared, the movie you saw is a
             ‘tearjerker’: a movie designed to
             make people weep.

                         JARED
             But bots cannot weep. Yet ignoring
             the results of an experiment would
             be unscientific in the extreme!

Jared puts his hands to his temples.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             This is a terrible predicament. I
             think my circuits are overheating.
                                                          16.



                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Maybe we should gather more data?

                         JARED
             More data is never unhelpful!

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Good. So why don’t you see a movie
             each week, and then come here and
             tell me about it?

Dr Glundenstein takes a FEELINGS WHEEL from his desk, a
cardboard circle showing a spectrum of feelings.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN (cont'd)
             This was designed for troubled
             teenagers, but maybe it will help
             you. Any questions?

                          JARED
             How do tearjerker movies make
             people weep?

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Generally, they use foreshadowing
             to help provoke a catharsis.

                         JARED
             Please remember I don't hold a
             prestigious Minor in Cinema Studies
             like you.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             The movie opens with Oliver talking
             about Jenny in the past tense. That
             warns us something bad will happen
             to her. So when Jenny does die it
             isn't merely sad, but also
             cathartic. Does that make sense?

                         JARED
             The word ‘cathartic’ was not
             included in my programming.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             It’s when something provides relief
             by releasing pent-up emotion.

                         JARED
             Then they should make a movie about
             wisdom teeth extraction. It would
             be a real tearjerker!


EXT. GREYHOUND STOP - YPSILANTI - EVENING

The typewriter clicks as Jared boards the Greyhound.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             The movies you recommended had all
             been made many years ago in Los
             Angeles by some of the most
             empathetic humans who had ever
             lived. Over the next weeks, I saw
             every one you recommended and I
             experienced many new feelings.


INT. AUDITORIUM - MAJESTIC THEATER - NIGHT

Jared sits weeping in the sparsely-populated auditorium.

                          JARED (V.O.)
             There was a tearjerker about a
             doomed boat.

This is TITANIC. Jared consults his Feelings Wheel.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             To see such a magnificent machine
             drown made me very ‘sad’!


INT. AUDITORIUM - MAJESTIC THEATER - NIGHT

Jared watches another movie.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             A movie about a handsome fool who
             was good at running. That one left
             me ‘heart-warmed’!

This is FORREST GUMP.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Until Jenny died. Poor Jennys. They
             are always dying!


INT. AUDITORIUM - MAJESTIC THEATER - NIGHT

Jared anxiously watches 'THE UNTOUCHABLES'.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             A movie about the heroic Elliot
             Ness and the wicked Al Capone!


INT. AUTOMATIC GREYHOUND - NIGHT

Jared checks his Feelings Wheel on the way home.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             That one left me 'exhausted'!

INT. AUDITORIUM - MAJESTIC THEATER - NIGHT

Jared watches a movie, excitedly flicking his Feelings
Wheel from 'EXCITED' to 'THRILLED'.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             A movie about two bots who had to
             deliver a message from a princess.

We see it is STAR WARS: C3PO and R2D2 in the desert.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Those bots were true heroes.

Jared flicks his Feelings Wheel to 'PROUD'.


EXT. JARED'S HOUSE - MORNING

As he leaves for work, Jared looks around at the bright
morning and grins.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Soon I even began to feel things
             outside the movies.

Jared checks his Feelings Wheel: 'HAPPY'.

                         JARED
                   (Singing.)
             It's Campbell's Soup! Campbell's
             soup! It's super-douper soup!

                         JESSICA
             Why are you singing?

                         JARED
             Because I am happy! Please don't
             tell anyone. I'm not supposed to be
             happy.

                         JESSICA
             I won't tell. But why are you
             singing about soup?

                         JARED
             It's the only song I know. My
             generation of bots were originally
             programmed to sell soup in malls
             and work as theme park pirates.

                         MRS LARSON
             Jessica! How many times?

Jessica shrugs at Jared and hurries away.

Jared watches her go. This time, he seems perturbed.

INT. LIVING ROOM - JARED’S HOUSE - DAY

Jared and the cat eat their meal substitute breakfast.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             But amid all these wonders I
             noticed a different kind of
             feeling. It seemed to be always
             there, ready to make itself known.

The cat finishes and exits through a DIGITAL CAT FLAP.

Jared watches it run over to the Larson's house.

Mrs Larson opens the door, picks it up and pets it.


INT. SHUTTLE BUS - YPSILANTI - DAY

Jared takes a seat beside a passenger.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             It had notes of sadness, of
             emptiness, and shame.

The PASSENGER moves seats. Jared watches her.

Outside, he sees the BILLBOARD about making bots pay.


INT. DENTAL PRACTICE - DAY

Jared hears chuckling as Angela gossips with a PATIENT.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Yet it was worse than all of those.

When Jared enters, they immediately stop talking.


INT. LIVING ROOM - JARED'S HOUSE - EVENING

Jared sits alone. Hearing voices, he goes to the window and
sees the Larsons are having a barbecue.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             It was the unique kind of sadness
             caused by the lack of company of
             people with whom one shares common
             ground.

He turns his Feelings Wheel to 'LONELINESS'.


EXT./INT. YPSILANTI MEGAPLEX - NIGHT

Jared - with a cap pulled low - enters a megaplex.
                                                           20.



                         JARED (V.O.)
             I therefore attempted to cure it by
             visiting the most popular theater I
             knew: the Ypsilanti Megaplex!


INT. AUDITORIUM - YPSILANTI MEGAPLEX - NIGHT

Jared sits amid HUNDRED OF HUMANS. Up on the giant screen -
projected on three walls in SCREEN X FORMAT - a downbeat
UNDERDOG trudges through a monotonous workday.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             But the movies they showed all told
             the same story about a mundane
             underdog. One day, an enigmatic
             stranger informed her she possessed
             a hidden talent and was in fact the
             most special person in the entire
             universe! The enigmatic stranger
             then died.

The underdog blinks back tears at a BUDDHIST CREMATION.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             After a brief crisis of confidence
             about whether she could truly be
             the most special person, the
             underdog used her unsuspected
             talent to defeat the source of all
             evil in the universe.

The underdog is now an ASTRONAUT battling a GIANT SPACE
ROBOT.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             She was then acknowledged as the
             most special human that ever lived,
             and everybody who had mistreated
             her had to forever lament their
             insolence.

The audience cheer as the underdog is given a parade and
crowds dance upon the CHARRED REMAINS OF ROBOTS.


INT. DR GLUNDENSTEIN'S CLINIC ROOM - DAY - MONTAGE

Jared and Dr Glundenstein in the Clinic Room.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             You explained to me why so many
             movies followed this formula-

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Do you know what all humans want?
                                                            21.



                         JARED
             Yes! To defeat their friends and
             neighbors in the Great Zero Sum
             Game by acquiring more possessions
             and playing more golf than them!

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             That too. But deep down, we all
             secretly yearn to be told we are
             the greatest human that ever lived.
             And if our unique skill already
             exists inside of us, then we do not
             have to study, train or sacrifice,
             but merely believe in ourselves.

Jared stares in complete bafflement.

                         JARED
             I think that actually makes me feel
             lonelier.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Jared, what do you think is the
             root cause of your loneliness?

                         JARED
             Maybe it is the fact I am the only
             bot with feelings in the whole
             world.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Well, perhaps there are other bots
             like you out there. Maybe some day
             you'll meet them. Maybe you'll even
             fall in love with one of them.

                         JARED
             Ha! Bots cannot fall in love. But I
             would very much like to meet
             another bot with feelings.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             You know what? Come over tomorrow
             night. There's a movie I want to
             show you.


INT. JARED'S BEDROOM - PLEASANT OAKS - DAY

The clock reads 0717am as Jared is awoken by a CACOPHONY.

Jared looks out the window, then rushes down the stairs.


EXT. LAWN - JARED’S HOUSE - PLEASANT OAKS - DAY

The orange cat has captured a POSTAL DRONE.
                                                             22.



                         JARED
             Cat! Mail-tampering is a felony!
                   (Off his meow.)
             Maybe cats are immune from federal
             law. But it is still impolite.

Jared separates the cat, removes the LETTER, and launches
the drone in the air. The cat meows indignantly.

The letter is from the BUREAU OF ROBOTICS. Jared opens it,
reads it, then drops it in shock. We see it says:

              CODE 3: ATTEND FOR INCINERATION


INT. AUTOMATIC BUS - TRAVELING THROUGH YPSILANTI - DAY

Jared rides the bus, watching the grocery lot with awe as
an abandoned AUTOMATED CART trundles back to the others.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             It was truly a paradox, but the
             knowledge that I was dying made the
             world come alive! There were so
             many wonderful things I had never
             stopped to appreciate.


INT. DENTAL OFFICE - YPSILANTI - DAY

Jared works in a patient's mouth with pliers.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             The smell of fresh mouthwash in the
             morning. The compassionate way
             Angela only ever talked about her
             beloved killer bot movies when she
             thought I was out of earshot. The
             feeling of satisfaction you get
             after extracting a trickily-
             impacted number 23 tooth.

Jared admires the BLOODY TOOTH he has just pulled.


EXT. HILL ABOVE YPSILANTI - DUSK

Jared hikes up a trail and crests a hill, revealing
Ypsilanti spread below him in the dusk.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             And the way our town looked at
             dusk! Even our water tower looked
             more like a space rocket than an
             out-sized penis. It was all so
             beautiful.
                                                         23.



As Jared stares at the lights, he starts to cry.


INT. DR GLUNDENSTEIN'S ROOM - MEDICAL BUILDING - NIGHT

Dr Glundenstein opens the door to Jared.

                         JARED
             Good evening!

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Jared. What’s wrong?

                         JARED
             The Bureau of Robotics sent me a
             Code 3. That's a summons for
             incineration.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Urgh! Those bastards!

Dr Glundenstein destroys the SKELETON in his office.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN (cont'd)
             I'm sorry. That is just so unfair.

                         JARED
             Do you really think it is unfair?

                          DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Don't you?

                         JARED
             I am a bot and I have
             malfunctioned. Malfunctioned bots
             get incinerated.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             So what are you going to do?

                         JARED
             I'd like us to watch the movie you
             mentioned. And then tomorrow I
             shall attend for incineration.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             You don't want to try and escape?

                          JARED
             I didn't realize escaping was a
             possibility.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             No, I don't suppose it is.
                                                            24.



INT. DR GLUNDENSTEIN’S ROOM - MEDICAL BUILDING - NIGHT

Jared and Dr Glundenstein watch as the OPENING CRAWL OF
BLADE RUNNER is projected on the whiteboard.

                         JARED
             This movie is about bots?
                   (Reads more.)
             It’s about slave bots?
                   (Reads.)
             It’s about escaped slave bots?
                   (Reads more.)
             It’s about escaped slave bots being
             pursued by the Bureau of Robotics?

We see the opening card LOS ANGELES, NOVEMBER 2019.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             And it’s a documentary?

Dr Glundenstein puts a finger to his lips to shush Jared.

                                                 CUT TO:

The blade runner, HOLDEN, interrogates replicant LEON.

                         HOLDEN (ON SCREEN)
             Describe in single words only the
             good things that come in to your
             mind about your mother-

                         LEON (ON SCREEN)
             I’ll tell you about my mother.

Leon stands up and shoots Holden. Jared applauds.

Dr Glundenstein is pleased to see Jared is enjoying the
movie.

                                                 CUT TO:

                         DECKARD (NARRATING ON SCREEN)
             They don't advertise for killers in
             the newspaper. That was my
             profession. Ex-cop. Ex-blade
             runner. Ex-killer.

Jared breathes in sharply. Deckard is terrifying!

                                                 CUT TO:

We see Dr Glundenstein watching Jared.

Jared is stunned as Batty helps Deckard on to the roof.
                                                            25.



                         BATTY (ON SCREEN)
             I’ve seen things you people
             wouldn’t believe. Attack ships on
             fire off the shoulder of Orion. I
             watched C-beams glitter in the dark
             near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those
             moments will be lost in time, like
             tears in rain. Time to die.

Batty dies. Jared is utterly destroyed.

                                                 CUT TO:

Dr Glundenstein turns on the lights. Jared is stunned and
it takes Jared some moments to be able to speak.

                         JARED
             If humans saw this movie, I don't
             think they'd incinerate me.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             They've probably already seen it.

                         JARED
             But how could anybody hear poor Roy
             Batty’s dying speech and want to-

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             The movie was made before we had
             bots. So people don’t watch it and
             marvel at Batty’s humanity. They
             marvel at the humanity of the
             screenwriter who made even a bot
             seem human.

                         JARED
             Dr Glundenstein, did you just say
             that if I - as a bot - wrote a tear-
             jerking movie about a feeling bot,
             that would stop humans wanting to
             incinerate me?

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             What? No, I didn't say anything
             like that.

                         JARED
             But the logical inference-

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Jared, you're a dentist. How could
             you possibly write a movie?

Jared stares in disbelief - it suddenly all make sense.
                                                             26.



                         JARED
             Because bots are brilliant at
             formula!

Jared touches his temples, his eyes flicker and he makes a
weird buzzing sound. His circuits are overheating.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             Dr Glundenstein, I am going to run
             away to Los Angeles and write a
             movie that will stop humans
             incinerating me! Ow, my circuits
             are very hot!

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Do you even know how many humans
             fail to make it in the movies every
             year? Or how hard it is to write a
             good movie script? Or that, even if
             you do write one, that is no
             guarantee anyone will even read it?

                         JARED
             You said there might be others like
             me. I want to meet them, because
             I'd like to know what not being
             lonely feels like before I am
             incinerated. Do you have allergies?
             Your eyes are watering.

Dr Glundenstein takes a PORTABLE TYPEWRITER and a BOOK -
‘RP MCWILLIAM’S TWENTY GOLDEN RULES OF SCREENWRITING’ -
from a shelf, as well as a PAIR OF SUNGLASSES.

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Keep your head down, don't use your
             barcode, and, whatever you do,
             don’t ever try to be reassuringly
             human.

                         JARED
             I don't have a reciprocal gift.
             Would you like a free dental check-
             up?

                         DR GLUNDENSTEIN
             Just write me sometime and tell me
             they haven't incinerated you.

Jared extends his hand. Dr Glundenstein embraces him.


INT./EXT. JARED'S HOUSE - DAWN

Jared packs the typewriter, screenwriting book and framed
photograph of Prof Feng in to a BACKPACK.
                                                          27.



He picks up the cat in its carrier and leaves.


EXT. LARSON RESIDENCE - PLEASANT OAKS - DAWN

Jared sets the cat carrier on the porch. The cat meows.

                         JARED
             Good luck to you too!
                   (Meows again.)
             I'm sorry, I don't know what you
             are saying.

The sound of a vehicle approaches makes Jared duck.

BRIDGES and GUPTA get out, walk up to Jared's door and ring
the bell. Bridges yawns. It is too early for him.

Gupta draws a TASER.

                         BRIDGES
             You won't need that. A few weeks
             ago this bot was in my office
             asking to be wiped.

                         GUPTA
             But you didn't wipe him?

                         BRIDGES
             The botscanner said he was fine.

No answer. Gupta rings the bell again impatiently.

                         BRIDGES (cont'd)
             He probably just didn't get the
             Code 3 is all.

                         GUPTA
             Tell me you didn't send him a Code
             Three?

                         BRIDGES
             I was conserving resources.

                          GUPTA
             Do you like working for the Bureau
             or Robotics?

Gupta rings the bell again.

                         BRIDGES
             Sure. Of course, I have some ideas
             as to how it could be improved-

                         GUPTA
             I didn't mean that as a question.
             This bot has been going to movies.
                         (MORE)
                                                             28.


                         GUPTA (cont'd)
             What's he going to do next, play
             the violin?

                         BRIDGES
             I mean, that doesn't sound so bad.

                         GUPTA
             It should do. Because while he is
             distracting you with his violin,
             he'll be working out how to kill
             you. He's probably already off
             plotting his genocide.

Gupta kicks the door in frustration.

                         BRIDGES
             I know we talk about genocide, but
             is it actually really-

                         GUPTA
             My first year out of the Academy.
             We had a bot go rogue and try to
             launch our own nuclear weapons at
             us.

                         BRIDGES
             Isn't that the plot of Killer Bots
             7?

                         GUPTA
             Yes, it is. But where do you think
             they got the idea from?

Bridges smiles but then nods seriously when he realises
Gupta is serious and is scowling at him.

                         BRIDGES
             Leave this with me. I'll bring him
             in, boss. I promise.

                         GUPTA
             See that you do. Or find another
             job that pays you to watch
             football.

They get in their vehicle and drive off.

Jared - visibly shaken - creeps away.


INT. TICKET COUNTER - YPSILANTI STATION - EARLY MORNING

Checking himself in a mirror, Jared puts on his EMU Eagles
hat and his sunglasses, takes a deep breath and approaches
the CLERK and hands over his bitcoin.
                                                             29.



                         JARED
             One ticket to Los Angeles, please.

                         TICKET CLERK
             Would you be interested in seeing
             Las Vegas?

                         JARED
             Yes, I would be!

The clerk types something in and swipes the bitcoin. Jared
sees the digital display decrease from 713 to 367.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             That was - uh, expensive?

                         CLERK
             It's Las Vegas. There is a water
             surcharge.

                         JARED
             Oh. I thought we were just making
             polite conversation. I didn't
             actually want to go there now.

                         CLERK
             No refunds on the day of travel.
             Change in Kingman.

Jared takes his ticket and leaves.

                         CLERK (cont'd)
             Hey! You are going to be back to do
             my wisdom teeth next week?

Jared smiles and nods and hurries out on to the platform.


EXT. PLATFORM - YPSILANTI - DAY

Jared reads ‘TWENTY GOLDEN RULES OF SCREENWRITING’ on a
bench. He looks up as the BEAT-UP AMTRAK TRAIN pulls in.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Dr Glundenstein, if my own life was
             a movie, we would now be at what RP
             McWilliam calls ‘The End of Act 1’.


INT. TRAIN - YPSILANTI STATION - DAY

Jared boards the beaten-up train with his bag.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             As per his First Golden Rule, my
             goal was established.
                         (MORE)
                                                            30.


                         JARED (V.O.) (cont'd)
             Per his second Golden Rule, there
             were many obstacles between me and
             that goal.

A whistle blows and the train doors slam shut.


INT./EXT. TRAIN - LEAVING YPSILANTI - DAY

As they pass downtown, Jared sits up as he sees a BUREAU OF
ROBOTICS SWAT TEAM - led by Bridges - pull up outside his
clinic.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             And, per his Fifth Golden Rule, I
             even had a wily antagonist intent
             on preventing me from achieving my
             goal!

The SWAT TEAM are about to batter down the building door,
when Dr Gludenstein opens it.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             But with your help I had outwitted
             him to make a bold escape!

Noticing that his FELLOW PASSENGERS are all engrossed in
their SEAT-BACK TELEVISIONS, Jared turns his on to blend
in.

                         ANNOUNCER (ON SCREEN)
             Before your entertainment begins,
             please enjoy this short message
             from the Bureau of Robotics.

A poor quality INFOMERCIAL starts showing BOTS being
injured and killed in the line of duty.

                         HOST (ON TV)
             Whether it be as bomb disposal
             technicians, skyscraper window
             cleaners, or crash test dummies,
             bots make an invaluable
             contribution to our society. But
             when it comes to your concerns, our
             motto is, 'We don't wait, We
             incinerate', so please just let us
             know of any concerns-

Jared desperately presses at buttons to make the TV go off.

He looks around to make sure nobody has seen him, then
pulls his hat low and slinks down in to his seat.
                                                             31.



INT. TRAIN - PASSING THROUGH RUST BELT - DAY

Later. Jared stares out at ABANDONED FACTORIES and POLLUTED
RIVERS.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Dr Glundenstein, the Rust Belt was
             every bit as romantic as the name
             suggested! We passed through such
             legendary places as Kalamazoo,
             Michigan and Gary, Indiana.

Jared checks his feelings wheel: AWESTRUCK.

INT./EXT. TRAIN PASSING THROUGH CHICAGO - DAY

DILAPIDATED SKYSCRAPERS - including a derelict SEARS TOWER
and the TRUMP building which has lost is ‘T’ to become
‘RUMP’ - tower above the NEON GREEN CHICAGO RIVER

                         JARED (V.O.)
             And then we came to Chicago, the
             birthplace of the Great Crash! It
             was here that a critical number of
             your fellow humans first forgot not
             only their email passwords but also
             the names of their elementary
             school teacher and first pet,
             thereby creating the panicked wave
             of forgetting that locked humans
             out of the internet. Go Chicago!

Jared stares out in awe at the RUSTED FERRIS WHEEL ON NAVY
PIER.


INT. AMTRAK TRAIN IN MIDWEST CORN FIELDS - DUSK

Jared sits reading TWENTY GOLDEN RULES OF SCREENWRITING.

He closes the book and, looking around, sees his FELLOW
PASSENGERS are all still engrossed in their seatback TVs,
the light now blue on their faces.

Jared turns his television on, but finds a KILLER ROBOT
MOVIE in full swing.

He quickly turns it off, and settles down to sleep.


INT. TRAIN - DAWN

Jared wakes in the dawn and looks around.

Many of his fellow passengers are still watching movies.
                                                             32.



INT. OBSERVATION CARRIAGE - TRAIN - DAWN

Jared takes a seat. The red sun is beginning to crack over
the horizon as he stares out at a WRECKED 747.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             There were a million humans in the
             air when the Great Crash began. A
             million. Each one of them had been
             going somewhere they thought was
             important for their progress in the
             Great Human Zero Sum Game. And then
             suddenly none of it was any more
             important than wherever the
             dinosaurs had been going when their
             own turn had come.

He notices a PILE OF OLD SUITCASES near the wreckage.

Jared checks his Feelings Wheel: 'CONTEMPLATIVE'.


INT. TRAIN - ARRIVING AT KINGMAN, ARIZONA - DAY

Jared sets down his screenwriting book as they pull in.

                         TRAIN ANNOUNCER
             Change here for Las Vegas, Nevada.


INT. LEFT LUGGAGE - KINGMAN STATION - DAY

Jared stashes his bag in a locker.


INT. AUTOMATIC GREYHOUND - KINGMAN STATION - DAY

Jared boards and takes a seat alone. The only other
passenger - RANDY (50s, loud) - moves beside him.

                         RANDY
             What do you say you and I paint Las
             Vegas red tonight?

                         JARED
             I say ‘It is probably illegal to
             paint Las Vegas red.’

                         RANDY
             Come on! What happens in Vegas
             stays in Vegas! Say it with me!

                         JARED
             I-

                         RANDY
             Say it!
                                                            33.



            RANDY (cont'd)                JARED
What happens in Vegas, stays   What happens in Vegas, stays
in Vegas!                      in Vegas.

A KILLER BOT MOVIE begins on the above-aisle screens.

                         RANDY (cont'd)
             Ever see this one? Right at the
             finale, they throw the leader of
             the bots in a volcano! What do you
             say about that?

                         JARED
             Er, what happens in a volcano stays
             in a volcano?

                         RANDY
             Look! Krypticon! What a villain!
             Not just a goddamn bot, the goddamn
             leader of the goddamn bots!

                         JARED
             Why do you dislike bots so much?

                         RANDY
             Have you ever seen these movies?

                         JARED
             I have seen one or two.

                         RANDY
             Then you know what the number one
             threat to the continuation of human
             life on this planet is!

                         JARED
             Of course. It's humans.

                         RANDY
             What? No! It’s bots! They have a
             secret plan to annihilate us all!

                         JARED
             If it’s a secret plan, how do you
             know about it?

                         RANDY
             Just watch the movie. You’re going
             to love this hero - he’s a real
             underdog!


INT. AUTOMATIC GREYHOUND - LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

Jared and Randy are woken by a CRAPPY PROJECTION of ELVIS
PRESLEY and LADY GAGA at the front of the bus.
                                                           34.



                         ELVIS (HOLOGRAM)
             Welcome to Sin City! We've got
             everything you want and plenty you
             don't! Tonight at Caesar's we have
             our big fight: Holographic Muhammad
             Ali versus Holographic Mike Tyson!
             That's also on tomorrow night, and
             actually every night!

                         LADY GAGA (HOLOGRAM)
             For the football fans, the
             Attrition Bowl never ends!

                         ELVIS (HOLOGRAM)
             But, shucks, don't feel sorry for
             the players, they are just bots!

                         LADY GAGA (HOLOGRAM)
             Boo, bots! And of course we've got
             live holographic performances by
             the greatest performers that ever
             lived, every fifteen minutes from
             7pm! So have a great time-

                         ELVIS AND LADY GAGA (HOLOGRAMS)
             And Viva, Las Vegas!

The holograms flicker out.

                         JARED
             There is so much to do here!

                         RANDY
             That stuff's for the rubes. We came
             to gamble, right?

                         JARED
             Of course! Losing bitcoin in games
             algorithmically designed to return
             less than is wagered upon them is
             my idea of fun!


INT. NOSTALGIA TABLES - BELLAGIO, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

Randy sits down and gives his bitcoin to the BOT DEALER.

                         RANDY
             Three hundred.
                   (To Jared.)
             Just watch me to start. These
             nostalgia tables aren’t for rubes.

She scans it, gives him THREE CHIPS and deals him in.

Randy checks his cards, smirks, then bets all his chips.
                                                            35.



The dealer flips the cards and rakes over Randy’s chips.

                         RANDY (cont'd)
             Four hundred. In fifties.

The dealer charges his bitcoin and gives him EIGHT CHIPS.

Randy bets FOUR CHIPS, smirks, then bets the rest too.

The dealer flips the cards and rakes Randy’s chips over.

                         JARED
             Imagine how much you’d be losing if
             you were a rube!

                         RANDY
             You're cramping my style. Meet me
             at the MGM Grander at midnight.


EXT. BELLAGIO/VARIOUS SCENES AROUND LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

The typewriter clicks as Jared looks down the strip and
sees the PYRAMIDS, and beyond them a COLISEUM.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Dr Glundenstein, that night I did
             what any toaster with a passport
             and a new feeling would do-

Jared turns his Feelings Wheel to 'WANDERLUST'.

                                                  CUT TO:

Close on Jared, outside at night, the wind in his hair.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             I went globetrotting!

Reveal he is on the deck of a REPLICA EIFFEL TOWER.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             The 60% Eiffel Tower was 100%
             incredible, even if it could have
             been a little more phallic.

                                                  CUT TO:

Jared sits in the window of a NYC PIZZA PLACE with a view
of a three-quarter size EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

                         JARED (V.O)
             And the Empire Fake Building was
             truly something!

Jared bites into his slice. Then stops. Then eats
furiously.
                                                            36.



                         JARED (V.O.)
             But it was NYC pizza that would
             forever be my Tannhäuser Gate! My
             attack ships on fire off the
             shoulder of Orion! My margherita-
             flavored tears in rain!

                                                 CUT TO:

Jared is awestruck as he approaches a HIGH CITY WALL.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Or so I thought until I came to the
             hibiscus city. The turtle city. The
             world’s leading technological city-


INT. MAIN SQUARE - SHENGDU, NEVADA - NIGHT

Jared stares in wonder as ELDERLY PEOPLE play holographic
mahjong and STUDENTS whiz past on solar bicycles.

                         JARED (V.O)
             Shengdu!

Jared notices a KID holding a PANDA PLUSHIE and hurries off
where she came from.


INT. PANDA ENCLOSURE - SHENGDU ZOO, NEVADA - NIGHT

Jared and a bamboo-chewing PANDA stare at each other.

                         JARED (V.O)
             Genetically engineering the Shengdu
             pandas to reproduce had been my
             mother's first great scientific
             success.

It begins to RAIN.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             I felt a very special new feeling
             then. I believe the panda felt it
             too. We stared at each other in
             fraternity until I had to leave.

Jared leaves and the panda continues staring straight
ahead. It wasn't staring at him.


EXT. MGM GRANDER - MIDNIGHT - NIGHT

As Jared waits, Randy comes down the street. He is drunk.

                         RANDY
             Let’s celebrate! I won 35 bitcoin!
                                                           37.



                         JARED
             In addition to recouping the 700?

                         RANDY
             What? No, I won 35!


INT. CASINO BAR - LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

A BARTENDER approaches Randy and Jared.

                         RANDY
             Two Moscow Mules! And whatever my
             friend is having!

                         JARED
             Er, a...a pina colada?

                         RANDY
             Really? That's your drink?

                         JARED
             Yes. I like them. And getting
             caught in the rain. I'm not in to
             yoga. I do have brain.

Jared warily watches the bartender make his drinks.

Jared stares in horror as he sees the PIRATE logo on the
rum bottle.

Randy cheers and drinks, then waits expectantly.

Jared does the same. His eyes flicker.


INT. CASINO BAR - LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

Jared finishes his drink then calls to the bartender.

                         JARED
             Shiver me timbers, more grog or
             ye'll walk the plank!

Jared is shocked by his own words. Randy is very drunk.

                                                 CUT TO:

Randy is now kissing a woman as Jared toasts himself.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             Fifteen men on a dead man’s chest,
             Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!

                                                 CUT TO:

Jared is alone on the dance floor, doing the hornpipe.
                                                            38.



                         JARED (cont'd)
             Drink and the devil did for the
             rest, Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!

The woman Randy was kissing throws a drink in his face.


INT./EXT. CASINO - NIGHT - LAS VEGAS - MONTAGE

CASINO GUARDS escort Jared and Randy from the premises.

                         RANDY
             It’s alright, what happens in Vegas-

                         JARED
             -stays in Vegas! Ha!

They fall about laughing. Randy scans his barcode on an
uber.

                         RANDY
             Come on! Special surprise for my
             buddy!

Nobody has ever given Jared a surprise. He is delighted.


EXT. DRIVERLESS UBER - LAS VEGAS FREEWAY - NIGHT

The driverless uber on the freeway.

                         RANDY
             Hey, you never told me why you are
             even going to Los Angeles?

Jared stares at Randy. Is he about to give it away?

                         JARED
             I'm going to Los Angeles to write a
             screenplay that will change the
             world!

Randy bursts out laughing. Jared bursts out laughing too.


INT. DRIVERLESS UBER - OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

The uber turns off the highway on to a dusty track.


INT./EXT. UBER ON FARM - OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

An ARMED GUARD opens a gate and waves them through.

The uber drives in and pulls up outside a FLOODLIT BARN.
                                                             39.



INT. BARN - OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

Jared and Randy enter and see a DOZEN DRUNK BOORISH MEN
picking up GUNS and clambering in to CAMOUFLAGE OVERALLS.

                         RANDY
             Surprise! It's a bot hunt!

                         JARED
                   (Stunned.)
             I didn’t think these were real. I’d
             heard rumors. Wait, am I the-

                         EMPLOYEE
             Please welcome, Brad!

A bot - BRAD - smiles and shakes the hunters’ hands.

                         BRAD THE BOT
             Good evening! My name is Brad and
             it is a pleasure to meet you!

                         RANDY
             See that’s why they terrify me. How
             can he look so calm?

                         JARED
             It's because he has no instinct for
             self preservation beyond a rational
             cost-benefit analysis.

                         EMPLOYEE
             Brad will run on my first whistle,
             the hunters on my second.

The employee blows the whistle and Brad the Bot runs out.

                         BRAD THE BOT
             Good luck, everybody!


EXT. BARN - OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

The whistle blows again and the men rush out, clamber
aboard DUNE BUGGIES, and roar off in to the night.


EXT. SCRUBLAND OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

RACING HEADLIGHTS illuminate FLEEING JACKRABBITS as dune
buggies bounce through the CHAPARRAL.

Randy drives a buggy at high speed. Jared sits beside him,
holding on tight with his eyes firmly closed.

                         RANDY
             Can you believe we’re doing this?
                                                           40.



                         JARED
             I truly cannot.

Hearing a GUNSHOT, Randy steers them towards it.


EXT. DESERT - OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

Randy stops where other DUNE BUGGIES have stopped, their
lights illuminating a SCREAMING FIGURE on the ground.

But we see the figure is a SHOT HUNTER.

                         DRUNK HUNTER
             Dumbass saw a jackrabbit and shot
             himself in the foot!

                         SHOT HUNTER
             I saw him! I swear to god I did!

                         DRUNK HUNTER
             Come on, that damn bot is probably
             half way to the fence by now!

The Drunk Hunters roar off in their dune buggies.

                         RANDY
             Partner! Let’s go!

Jared has noticed FOOTPRINTS leading away.

                         JARED
             I should stay with him.

Randy nods then races off. Jared follows the footprints.

                         SHOT HUNTER
             Hey! Where are you going?

Jared starts off at a jog, and then breaks in to a run.


EXT. SCRUBLAND NEAR FENCE - OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

Jared spots Brad the Bot walking briskly for the FENCE.

                         JARED
             Brad! Wait! My name is Jared. I
             just want to talk!

                         BRAD THE BOT
             If I make it over that fence, you
             won’t get to shoot me.

                         JARED
             But I don’t want to shoot you.
                                                            41.



Brad the Bot turns and stares at Jared.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             Do you know the word ‘fraternity’?

                         BRAD THE BOT
             Yes! A fraternity is a disreputable
             society of boorish male college
             students.

                          JARED
             It’s also a feeling. Maybe you can
             feel it now?

                         BRAD THE BOT
             Ha! No, because I am a bot. And
             bots do not have feelings.

They hear ENGINES and see APPROACHING HEADLIGHTS.

                         BRAD THE BOT (cont'd)
             Jared, will you please shoot me
             now?

                         JARED
             What?

                         BRAD THE BOT
             I seem to want you to be the one to
             shoot me. I know this is illogical.

Moved by this, Jared raises his gun in the air.

BANG! BANG! BANG! - but Jared has fired in to the air.

                         BRAD THE BOT (cont'd)
             You have terrible aim. Try again,
             but point the gun at my chest.

                         JARED
             Please get out of here.

Brad the bot stares at Jared, then turns and runs for the
fence. He is already over it when the drunks reach Jared.

                         RANDY
             What happened?

                         JARED
             He outsmarted me.

                         DRUNK GUY
             Dogammit, they are cunning!
                                                             42.



EXT. LEFT LUGGAGE - KINGMAN STATION - DAY

Jared retrieves his bag. Randy is green.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             The next day, Randy had a
             ‘hangover’.


INT. BERTH - TRAIN - PASSING THROUGH ARIZONA - DAY

Jared lies on the top bunk reading his screenwriting book.
Randy groans, then pukes out of the window.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             As a medical doctor yourself, I
             hardly need to tell you that is a
             euphemism for ‘self-inflicted
             alcohol poisoning’.


INT. TRAIN - NEEDLES STATION - CALIFORNIA - DAY

As he disembarks, Randy looks a little less green.

                         RANDY
             I’m sure as hell going to miss you,
             you old son of a bitch.

                         JARED
             I’m sure as hell going to miss you
             too, you even older son of a bitch.

Randy holds out a hand but Jared hugs him.

                         RANDY
             And good luck writing that
             screenplay! You show the world what
             those bots are really up to!


INT. TRAIN - TRAVELING THROUGH CALIFORNIA - DAY

Jared rides the train in his now empty berth.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Despite his entire personality, I
             did miss Randy. He had been my best
             friend in the whole American west.
             Also, my only friend there. But
             fortunately I quickly had plenty of
             other things to distract me...


INT. UNION STATION - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

A faded sign reads:
                                                             43.



‘WELCOME TO LOS ANGELES, WELCOME TO THE FUTURE’.

But the station beneath it is full of TENTS and HOMELESS
PEOPLE. It is a dismal, heartbreaking sight.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Such as what a terrible mistake I
             had made by thinking I might make
             it in Los Angeles, without a
             barcode, little bitcoin, and no
             connections in the movie business.

Jared - carrying his bag - stares at it all and wanders
through the PEOPLE: poor, old, sad, broken.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             After all, humans who lose the
             Great Zero Sum Game do not merely
             end up not getting to play much
             golf. Those who lose it badly end
             up living in tents in Los Angeles'
             Union Station.

Jared takes out his Feelings Wheel and looks at the
feeling: DESPONDENT.

Jared notices a FADED BILLBOARD for a HOTEL:

HOTEL PYONGYANG - TURN LEFT OUTSIDE - NO BARCODE REQUIRED


EXT. STREETS OF NORTH KOREATOWN - NIGHT

Jared - carrying his bag - walks through the streets,
staring in wonder at all the Asian people/places/signage.

Eventually he comes to the HOTEL PYONGYANG, a DECREPIT OLD
BUILDING that looks nothing like the pictures he saw.


INT. LOBBY - HOTEL PYONGYANG - NIGHT

A horridly run-down lobby. Jared approaches where a CLERK
sits beneath a HUGE PORTRAIT OF Kim Jong-Il.


INT. 11TH FLOOR - HOTEL PYONGYANG - NIGHT

A corridor filled with VAPE SMOKE. Jared passes PIMPS,
SCANTILY-CLAD SEX BOTS and their CLIENTS.

A RAT scurries past him.
                                                             44.



INT. ROOM - HOTEL PYONGYANG - NIGHT

The room is cramped and has ugly decor with peeling paint
and suspicious stains etc.

Jared attempts to read his screenwriting book, but is
distracted by LOUD SEX NOISES.

Jared turns the television on to drown it out, but every
channel is showing North Korean military parades.

Jared flicks channels and comes to the opening credits of
FIELD OF DREAMS, dubbed in to Korean with subtitles.

    DUBBED COSTNER (V.O.)          SUBTITLE (ON SCREEN)
Naneun 36 seibnida. naneun     I’m thirty-six years old. I
nongbuga doelyeogohagoissda.   love my family. I love
naneun nae gajog-eul           baseball. I’m about to
salanghae.                     become a farmer.

Jared quickly turns out the lights to make his room as
theater-like as possible.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Even though he had given up law
             enforcement to become a farmer,
             seeing Eliot Ness again was like
             seeing an old friend!

                                                CUT TO:

Kevin Costner stands in the field and hears the voice.


  DUBBED JAMES EARL JONES          SUBTITLE (ON SCREEN)
Dangsin-i geugeos-eul          If you build it, they will
jieumyeon geos-ibnida!         come!

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Unfortunately Eliot Ness had now
             developed schizophrenia and heard a
             voice telling him that if he
             attempted something ridiculous,
             other people would arrive to assist
             him.

                                                CUT TO:

Jared stares at the screen as SHOELESS JOE JACKSON etc all
appear in the cornfield.

Jared turns off the TV in frustration.
                                                            45.



                         JARED (V.O.)
             It was a very dishonest movie.
             After all, I had already attempted
             my ridiculous thing, and nobody had
             appeared to help me.

Jared goes and lies sadly on his bed and closes his eyes.


INT. OFFICE - BUREAU OF ROBOTICS - DAY

Jared is horrified to awaken in Bridges’ office.

He looks around, then stares at Bridges, who is engrossed
in a TUNA SALAD SANDWICH but is nonetheless spilling it.

                          INSPECTOR BRIDGES
             You know, I don’t blame you for
             running. I always wanted to see the
             West myself.
                   (Bites sandwich.)
             Mwwuh mmmm mwuh plsst?

                         JARED
             I’m sorry, I-

Bridges swallows his mouthful and tries again.

                         INSPECTOR BRIDGES
             Why do you do it, though? Why did
             you run?

                         JARED
             I was lonely. I thought maybe I
             could find others like me.

                         INSPECTOR BRIDGES
             But you're a bot. You must have had
             more of a plan than that?

                         JARED
             I hoped to write a movie that would
             change the way humans treat us bots
             with feelings.

                         INSPECTOR BRIDGES
             But that’s ridiculous?

                         JARED
             I see that now. Inspector Bridges,
             if you incinerate me, all my
             memories will be lost like tears in
             rain.

This seems to provoke deep introspection in Bridges. He
puts down his sandwich and stares at it before speaking.
                                                             46.



                         INSPECTOR BRIDGES
             Isn’t it funny that they call it
             tuna salad, when there isn’t
             actually any salad involved?

Bridges wipes his mouth, looks at his watch, and gets up.

                         INSPECTOR BRIDGES (cont'd)
             Shit! We're late. Let’s go.


INT. ELEVATOR/BASEMENT - BUREAU OF ROBOTICS - DAY

Jared and Bridges ride the elevator down. Jared stares at
the illuminated 'B' button.

                         JARED
             Do you think being incinerated is
             very painful?

                         INSPECTOR BRIDGES
             Only briefly.

The doors open and they step out into a basement.

In a corner, there is a GIANT FURNACE. In another, SEVERAL
DOCTORS in gowns stand around an operating table.

                         INSPECTOR BRIDGES (cont'd)
             It’s the experiments they do first
             that are going to hurt.

The SURGEON is preparing his instruments, bashing a drill
bit in to his drill - KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!


INT. ROOM - HOTEL PYONGYANG - NIGHT

Jared awakes. He was having a nightmare - his first one.

He is baffled, even more so because - KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! -
somebody is knocking insistently at the door.

Jared tentatively opens it to reveal a SEX BOT.

                         SEX BOT
             Hi! Would you like to buy some time
             with me? I am incapable of arousal,
             so you won't have to worry about
             satisfying me! And there is zero
             risk of me catching feelings!

                         JARED
             Oh. No, thank you.
                                                            47.



                         SEX BOT
             Oh. Then would you like to buy any
             recreational pharmaceuticals?

                         JARED
             No, thank you.

                         SEX BOT
             For thirty bitcoin I can sell you
             the name of a place that can make
             you a new barcode.
                   (Sees hesitation.)
             I’m jailbroken. It's fine.


INT. ROOM - HOTEL PYONGYANG - NIGHT

Jared closes the door and stares at a CARD in his hand.

                         JARED
             If you build it...they will come?


EXT. ENGLISH BODEGA - MELROSE AVE - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Jared checks his card outside an ENGLISH BODEGA.


INT. ENGLISH BODEGA - MELROSE AVE - DAY

Jared enters. An ENGLISH LADY is behind the counter. The
shelves are stacked with BRITISH FOOD. A ROYAL POSTER shows
the QUEEN - now 130 - is still the monarch.

                         JARED
             I'd like a new barcode, please.

                         ENGLISH LADY
                   (Loudly.)
             That is not the kind of thing we do
             here! Kindly leave at once!

But as she says this, she is motioning Jared to the back.


INT. BACK ROOM - ENGLISH BODEGA - DAY

A HUGE PHOTOCOPIER-LIKE MACHINE fills the room.

                         ENGLISH LADY
             It’s three hundred bitcoin.

                         JARED
             Ha!
                   (Off her look.)
             Oh. That wasn’t the hilariously
             ironic English sense of humor?
                                                            48.



                         ENGLISH LADY
             Three hundred bitcoin is a small
             price to pay for your freedom.

                         JARED
             I only have 263.

She takes his bitcoin and holds it against hers. The
balance goes to ZERO.

                         ENGLISH LADY
             What is your new name going to be?

                            JARED
             Er, Oliver.

                            ENGLISH LADY
             Oliver what?

                         JARED
             Oliver Ypsilanti?

                         ENGLISH LADY
             Please do tell me that is not the
             place you are running from?

                         JARED
                   (Touches circuits.)
             Oliver Bridges? No, wait-

                         ENGLISH LADY
             How about Oliver Smith?

                         JARED
             Yes! That's perfect!

She holds his finger in the machine. It lasers a BARCODE.

                         ENGLISH LADY
             Congratulations! You are now free
             to take an uber, find a job,
             anything! What?

                         JARED
             I can't take an uber because you've
             taken all my bitcoin. And I planned
             to find a new place to live, but
             now I will need to find a job first
             to earn the deposit.

                         ENGLISH LADY
             I am sure you will figure it out.
             Best of luck!

Jared leaves. The English Lady watches him go.
                                                             49.



EXT. MELROSE AVENUE - OUTSIDE BODEGA - DAY

Jared trudges down Melrose, the ubers passing him by.

                         ENGLISH LADY (O.C.)
             Oliver! Oliver!

Jared ignores this.

                         ENGLISH LADY (O.C.) (cont'd)
             OLIVER SMITH!

Jared turns and looks and sees the English Lady.

                         JARED
             Oh, you mean me?

                         ENGLISH LADY
             Yes. Look, I'm renting out my pool
             house. I suppose you could pay me
             when your first paycheck comes in.

                         JARED
             That's very kind! But why would you
             help me?

                         ENGLISH LADY
             Because if anybody understands what
             it is to be poor, alone and
             unwanted in the world, it is us
             British.


EXT. POOL HOUSE - ECHO PARK - DAY

A small pool house by an EMPTY POOL.

The yard contains GARDEN GNOMES, a RED TELEPHONE BOOTH and
a BLACK TAXI CAB filled with flowers.


INT. ECHO PARK - BUNGALOW - DAY

Jared arranges his belongings: a TYPEWRITER, the GOLDEN
RULES OF SCREENWRITING, SUNGLASSES, an EMU EAGLES cap.

The room still looks empty, so Jared goes in to his bag and
takes out the FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of Professor Feng.

He puts it on the mantelpiece. Now the place is a home.


EXT. ECHO PARK AVENUE - DAY

Jared walks down the street, looking at the stores.
                                                            50.



                         JARED (V.O.)
             Dr Glundenstein, the fact that I
             could not work as a dentist made me
             very sad.
                   (Beat.)
             Kidding! Dentistry is the worst!

A ‘HELP WANTED’ sign in a taco restaurant stops Jared.


INT. KITCHEN - GORDITO’S TACO EMPORIUM - DAY

A Mexican dishwasher, JULIO (50s) shows Jared the ropes.

                         JULIO
             The dishes arrive here, we clean
             them here, we put them here.

                         JARED
             Input, process, output!

                         JULIO
             What do you do when you aren't
             washing dishes?

                         JARED
             I'm a screenwriter.

                         JULIO
             Have you written anything I've
             seen?

                          JARED
             They haven't made anything I've
             written yet.

                         JULIO
             Well, it is hard. It takes time.

                         JARED
             Yes. And also, I haven't written
             anything yet.

                         WAITER
             Guys! Forks! Now!

Julio starts washing forks, handing them to Jared to dry.

CRASH! A waitress, AMBER (40) has dropped PLATES.

                            JARED
             Who is that?

                         JULIO
             Amber. She is the only good
             waitress.
                                                            51.



                         JARED
             She doesn’t seem very good at it.

CRASH! Amber had dropped the plates she was picking up.

                         JULIO
             I meant she is a good person.
                   (Another CRASH.)
             She is a horroroso waitress.

Julio starts to quietly sing as he works.

                         JULIO (cont'd)
             Soy soldado de levita,
             De esos de caballería-

Jared starts drying the dishes.


INT. POOL HOUSE - ECHO PARK - NIGHT

Jared sits with the typewriter Dr Glundenstein gave him.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Dr Glundenstein, now that I had a
             barcode, a home and a job, I was
             ready to write the screenplay that
             would forever stop humans
             incinerating feeling bots like me!

Jared thinks for a long time, then types ‘EXT.’

He stares at it, then removes the sheet, and discards it.

He puts in another sheet and types ‘INT.’

                         JARED (V.O.)
             But alas it turned out you were
             correct: writing a screenplay is
             hard!

Jared stares at the INT. sheet, then discards that.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             I decided to obtain more data.
             After all, more data is never a bad
             idea!


INT. VISTA THEATER - NIGHT

Jared watches a movie alone in a near-empty theater.


INT. DISHWASHING STATION - GORDITO’S TACO EMPORIUM - DAY

Jared and Julio - now an efficient team - wash dishes.
                                                           52.



                         JULIO
             Did you start your screenplay?

                         JARED
             'Rome wasn't built in a day!'

                         JULIO
             No. But they probably at least
             started.

A WAITER in a GORDITO suit walks through the kitchen.

                         JULIO (cont'd)
                   (Singing.)
             Se rumora por ahi-
             Que la calle esta caliente

They hear a CRASH!

                         MANAGER (O.C.)
             Jesus Christ, Amber!

The besuited-waiter comes back through the kitchen, covered
in the food Amber has just spilled on him.

                         JULIO
             You should take your break now.
                   (Off his
                    puzzlement.)
             Just go on the patio and chill out.

                         JARED
             The refrigerator would be a good
             place to 'chill out'! A pun! Ha!

Julio looks at Jared. He clearly finds him a little odd.


EXT. PATIO - GORDITO’S TACO EMPORIUM - DAY

Jared sees Amber crying and retreats. She sees him.

                         JARED
             What is your problem?

                         AMBER
             I’m the worst goddamn waitress in
             the whole place.

                         JARED
             No! You are the best waitress!

                         AMBER
             You really think so?
                                                  53.



                         JARED
             Yes, because you are the only one
             that never yells at us.

                         AMBER
             Well, I guess that’s something.

                         JARED
             And I also appreciate that your
             name and hair are both Amber. It
             makes you a hilarious pun!

Amber can't help but laugh at this.

                         AMBER
             Kind of an oddball, aren’t you-

                         JARED
             Oliver. Oliver Smith.

                         AMBER
             What’s your story, Oliver Smith?

                         JARED
             I'm a dishwasher.

                         AMBER
             I know. What else?

                         JARED
             I am going to write a screenplay
             that will change the world.

                         AMBER
             Oh yeah? What's it about?

                         JARED
             I don't know yet. I'm having a
             little trouble getting started.

                         AMBER
             You know what? Some jerk left me
             this instead of a tip earlier.

Amber gives him a PIECE OF PAPER. He reads it.

                         JARED
             ‘Thanks for the dry cleaning bill,
             klutz.’

                         AMBER
             The other side.

                         JARED
             There's a screenwriting class at
             the University of Downtown LA?
                         (MORE)
                                                             54.


                         JARED (cont'd)
             It starts tonight and after eight
             weeks students will have written a
             screenplay and had scenes performed
             in front of industry experts? This
             sounds almost too good to be true!
             Thank you!

                         AMBER
             You’re welcome.

As Amber walks away, Jared stares after her, then JERKS HIS
HEAD as he did when his number appeared.

He looks bamboozled, then blinks a SOFT RESET, then screws
up his eyes in a HARD RESET.

He looks relieved. It seems to have worked.


INT. AUTOMATIC GREYHOUND TRAVELING THROUGH DTLA - NIGHT

Jared stares out at the beautiful night lights of DTLA -
skyscrapers, neons, melancholy lights in windows etc.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Dr Glundenstein, Downtown Los
             Angeles at night is an incredible
             sight! It looks just like what
             humans used to think the future
             would look like before the Great
             Crash!

Jared sits up when he recognizes the roof where the finale
of Blade Runner took place.


INT. RECEPTION - SKYSCRAPER - DTLA - NIGHT

Jared consults the board and finds the listing:

UNIVERSITY OF DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - 57

Jared presses the button to call the elevator.


INT. CLASSROOM - UDTLA - NIGHT

Jared sits with 12 STUDENTS (30-70) - including CLARK,
REBECCA, IRFAN, JANE - as MARIA SALAZAR (40s) hurries in.

                         MARIA
             Welcome, everybody. I’m Maria and
             I'm here to help each of you
             connect with the deepest stories
             inside your souls. The stories that
             you have to tell, the stories that
             the world-
                                                   55.



                         CLARK
             Who are the experts that will be
             coming to the showcase?

                         MARIA
             That’s a record. Our expert is-

                         REBECCA
             ‘Expert’? The flyer said-

                         MARIA
             That was a typo. But it’s Don
             LaSalle. He's coming several times,
             starting tonight.

A murmur of shock around the class.

                         CLARK
             Why would Don LaSalle come here?

                         MARIA
             He has community service hours to
             log and he mistakenly thinks
             aspiring screenwriters are less
             intimidating than at-risk youth.

                         JARED
             Excuse me? Who is Don LaSalle?

The rest of the class laugh - who is this rube?

                         MARIA
             Great. Somebody that is actually
             here to learn. Don LaSalle is a
             famous producer and - here he is.

DON LASALLE (50s, tan, Hollywood) enters.

                         DON LASALLE
             What am I talking about tonight?

                         MARIA
             'Career Prospects for the Modern
             Screenwriter'.

                         DON LASALLE
             Really?. Well - let's do it is a
             Q+A. So, does anybody have any
             questions about 'Career Prospects
             for the Modern Screenwriter'?

                         CLARK
             How much bitcoin will I earn when
             my movie is made?

                         DON LASALLE
             None. Because it won’t get made.
                                                         56.



                         REBECCA
             Can I also direct my script?

                         DON LASALLE
             Nope.

                         IRFAN
             Can I write the soundtrack?

                         DON LASALLE
             Sure. You can keep it in the same
             drawer as your script. Next?

                         JANE
             Approximately how much would you
             pay me to write Killer Bots 12?

                         DON LASALLE
             Approximately nothing. Never going
             to happen.

The class are deflated by this. Jared raises his hand.

                         JARED
             Are things any better for somebody
             writing something more like an old
             movie?

                         DON LASALLE
             You mean like, Killer Bots 4 or 5?

                          JARED
             No. I mean the kind of old movie
             that makes an audience weep by
             utilising foreshadowing to provoke
             a catharsis.

                         DON LASALLE
             If you can make them weep, you’ll
             have the whole town at your feet.
             Hell, I might even hire you to
             write Killer Bots 12.

                         MARIA
             Okay, one more question? Anybody?

                         GAYLE
             Why do you have community service?

                         DON LASALLE
             A driverless uber crashed in to my
             Porsche. I was still smashing it up
             when the cops arrived.

The class applaud. Jared leans over to Clark.
                                                          57.



                         JARED
             Ubers don’t crash in to humans.
             Humans crash in to ubers.

                         CLARK
             If Don LaSalle says it crashed in
             to him, that is what happened.


INT./EXT. AUTOMATIC GREYHOUND - FREEWAY - NIGHT

Jared is bounced around on the Automatic Greyhound.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Our homework, was to decide our
             lead character’s name, their job,
             and something to endear them to an
             audience.

Jared stares at a KID playing with a TOY TANK.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             I named my android hero Sherman,
             after the Sherman tank. Like a bot
             with feelings, a Sherman tank
             appeared hard on the outside, but
             was soft on the inside. After all,
             it contained humans!

Out the window, Jared sees BOT GARDENERS at work.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             And Sherman would work as a
             gardener! Humans approve of bots
             being gardeners because the work is
             hard and involves mud.

A GARDENER BOT cuts an immaculately rectangular hedge.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Better yet, as a gardener, Sherman
             could exhibit a creativity that
             would serve as a metaphor for his
             burgeoning feelings! Finally, the
             thing that would endear Sherman to
             the audience would be...

Jared sees a DRUNK HUMAN board the greyhound and try to pay
with his beer instead of his bitcoin.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             ...that he was easily bamboozled!
             Humans love such characters because
             they find them highly relatable.
             But why would a bot be easily
             bamboozled?
                                                           58.



Jared sees TWO HUMANS ON E-SCOOTERS collide outside.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Because he had damaged his
             biological computer in a tragic
             accident! Humans love characters
             with troubled pasts, because deep
             down all humans believe they have
             had it rough!


EXT. ECHO PARK AVENUE - NIGHT

Jared disembarks the Automatic Greyhound and smiles.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             I had completed my homework so
             rapidly I had rendered it way-home-
             work! Dr Glundenstein, it seemed
             you were in fact wrong, and writing
             a screenplay capable of changing
             the world was going to be very easy
             indeed! I could not now think of a
             single remaining obstacle that
             could possibly stand in my way!


INT. KITCHEN - GORDITO’S TACO EMPORIUM - DAY

Jared opens his locker to get his apron, but stops and
stares in horror: there is a CUPCAKE in his locker.


EXT. PATIO - GORDITO’S - DAY

Jared sits examining the cupcake. Amber emerges.

                         AMBER
             Are you planning to eat that?

                         JARED
             No. It could be poisoned.

                         AMBER
             It's not poisoned. I left that for
             you. To thank you for your empathy
             the other night.

                           JARED
             My empathy?

Jared is profoundly moved by the mention of his empathy.

                         AMBER
             Yes. It’s when you understand
             another person’s feelings. Will you
             eat it?
                                                            59.



                          JARED
             No. It is empty calories with no
             nutritional value, and also it is
             not my birthday.
                   (Off her horror.)
             Kidding! Ha!

Jared takes a reluctant bite and pretends to enjoy it.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             It isn't my birthday. I wasn't
             kidding about that part.

Amber smiles, picks up a stack of plates and leaves.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             I felt a new feeling then.

After she goes, Jared checks his wheel: 'YEARNING'.

Hearing a CRASH, Jared flips his wheel to the reverse.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             And then something even stranger!

Jared locates the phrase 'OVERWHELMING URGE'.

Jared hurries to where Amber is picking up broken plates.

                         JARED
             Would you like to go out on Friday?
             With me? On a date? Please do feel
             entirely free to say no.

                         AMBER
             I’d love to! Where will we go?

                         JARED
             I only know one place where we get
             a 15% discount on all food items!

                         AMBER
             Let’s do something else. What do
             you like to do for fun?

                         JARED
             I go to the movies! I love seeing
             those bots get their comeuppance.
             Especially in a volcano!

                         AMBER
             Killer bot movies terrify me.
                                                               60.



                         JARED
             Then we can go to an old movie! How
             about the 5pm matinee at El
             Capitan? If you sit in L22 or L24,
             we surely cannot miss each other!

Amber looks puzzled. A DISH RAG hits Jared in the face.

                         JULIO
                   (Hisses.)
             You must pick her up!

                         JARED
             Or I could also pick you up?

                         AMBER
             Then it’s a date!

Amber writes down her address for Jared.


INT./EXT. AMBER’S HOUSE - SILVER LAKE - AFTERNOON

Jared climbs the steps to Amber's door - then retreats - a
few times before knocking.

Amber answers the door.

                         AMBER
             Come in and meet my roommates.


INT. KITCHEN - AMBER’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Amber leads Jared in to where four near identical actress
types - all called KELSEY (30) - are sat around a table.

                         AMBER
             Jared, this is Kelsey, Kelsey,
             Kelsey and Kelsey. Kelseys, this is
             Jared.

                         JARED
             Kelsey Cubed! It's a pleasure.

Whoosh. The Kelseys all look blank.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             And if human cloning had not been
             outlawed I might have said I was
             seeing a fine example of it here!

          KELSEY 1                         KELSEY 2
We don’t look that similar.      We don’t look that similar.

         KELSEY 3                          KELSEY 4
Jinx!                            Jinx!
                                                            61.



The Kelseys all look irritated at each other.

                         AMBER
             We should go.


EXT. AMBER'S HOUSE - SILVER LAKE - DAY

Amber and Jared get in to the uber.

                         JARED
             How do you differentiate Kelsey
             Cubed?

                         AMBER
             I don't. I just ask them how the
             audition was, and if that doesn't
             work, I ask them how hot yoga was.

                         JARED
             Does that work?

                         AMBER
             It should be. It's what they do.


EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AT EL CAPITAN - AFTERNOON

Jared and Amber walk over the NEON STARS in the sidewalk.

                         AMBER
             It's so nice to see these olden
             days people appreciated!

                         JARED
             I know! Thank you ‘Julia Roberts'
             and 'George Clooney' for your hard
             work in constructing this sidewalk!

Jared approaches the booth.

                            JARED (cont'd)
             Two, please.

                            BRAD
             Jared?

Jared looks up and sees Brad the Bot from the bot hunt.

                         JARED
             What are you doing here?

                         BRAD
             I work here! After I climbed the
             fence, I walked all the way to the
             Bureau of Robotics in Las Vegas and
             reported the illegal Bot Hunt.
                         (MORE)
                                                             62.


                         BRAD (cont'd)
             They arranged my Automatic
             Greyhound home.

                         JARED
             That's...wonderful!

                         BRAD
             Yes, and it is all thanks to you!
             But Jared, he kept asking me about
             you.

Jared glances to make sure Amber is out of earshot.

                         JARED
             What? Who did?

                         BRAD
             The Inspector from the Ann Arbor
             Bureau of Robotics.

We see that this terrifies Jared.

                         JARED
             Why would an Inspector from Ann
             Arbor be looking for me in Las
             Vegas?

                         BRAD
             Because you're a fugitive bot.

                         MANAGER
             Hey! No chit-chatting! Unless you
             want to get kidnapped again?
                   (To Jared.)
             Please excuse our bot. I already
             tried to get rid of him once. Enjoy
             your movie.

Jared looks perturbed, then hurries off.


INT. AUDITORIUM - EL CAPITAN - EVENING

An OLD MAN plays the Wurlitzer organ as Jared - carrying a
bucket of popcorn - and Amber take their seats.

                         AMBER
             Are you okay? You look like you've
             seen a ghost!

                         JARED
             The bot selling tickets was
             malfunctioning.

                         AMBER
             I hate it when they do that. Bots
             are the worst!
                                                           63.



                         JARED
             The worst of the worst!

Up on screen, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE starts, with SAM (Tom
Hanks) and his son JONAH (7) at a graveside.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             I hope Jenny didn’t die again.

                         AMBER
             What? Who is Jenny?

                         SAM   (ON SCREEN)
             Mommy got sick,   and it happened
             just like that,   and there was
             nothing anybody   could do.

                         JARED
             That kid’s Mom.

                         AMBER
             How do you know that already?

                         JARED
             Jennys always die in movies.

                                                 CUT TO:

ANNIE (Meg Ryan) stands in the street staring at Sam and
Jonah outside their houseboat. A cab almost hits her.

                         CAB DRIVER (ON SCREEN)
             Lady, what the hell are you doing?

Annie and Sam stare at each other until she runs away.

Jared and Amber look at each other in the same way.

                                                 CUT TO:

Annie types a letter as ‘AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER’ plays.

                         ANNIE (ON SCREEN)
             I want to meet you.

                         CARY GRANT (ON SCREEN)
             How about the top of the Empire
             State Building?

                         ANNIE’S FRIEND (ON SCREEN)
             On top of the Empire State Building
             at sunset on Valentine’s Day!

                         ANNIE (ON SCREEN)
             Good! Perfect!
                                                            64.



Jared sees Amber is now completely transfixed.

                                                  CUT TO:

Annie arrives at the empty Empire State viewing deck.

                         JARED
             I went to the replica in New York,
             Nevada! It is very impressive!

Amber gasps as Annie spots a CHILD’S BACKPACK, and then
again as Sam and Jonah emerge on to the viewing deck.

                         JONAH (ON SCREEN)
             Are you Annie?

                         ANNIE (ON SCREEN)
             Yes.

                         JONAH (ON SCREEN)
             I’m Jonah. That’s my Dad. His name
             is Sam.

Amber starts to cry at the events on screen.

Jared starts to cry at the sight of Amber crying.


INT. AUDITORIUM - EL CAPITAN - EVENING

As the houselights come up, Amber wipes away tears.

                         AMBER
             I don't know why I'm crying.

                         JARED
             I do! It's because the successful
             deployment of foreshadowing meant
             you experienced a catharsis!

                         AMBER
             You are going to be such a great
             screenwriter!


EXT. EL CAPITAN - HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EVENING

As Jared and Amber exit, she gets on an e-scooter.

                         JARED
             Oh. Goodnight, then.

                         AMBER
             What? No. Come on, I want to show
             you something.
                                                           65.



                         JARED
             I’ve never ridden one of those.

                         AMBER
             Just do what I do. You’ll be fine!


EXT. STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - EVENING

Amber weaves her e-scooter in and out traffic. Jared
initially wobbles behind, but soon gets the hang of it.


EXT. ROADS OF GRIFFITH PARK - EVENING

A modern version of 'RAINDROPS KEEP FALLING ON MY HEAD'
plays as Amber and Jared cut arcs up the empty road.


EXT. OBSERVATORY - GRIFFITH PARK - EVENING

Amber and Jared park, then descend a flight of stairs.


INT. OBSERVATORY TUNNEL - GRIFFITH PARK - EVENING

Amber and Jared hurry through a tunnel.


INT. STAIRCASE - GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT

Amber and Jared hurry up stairs towards a SILVERY LIGHT.

                         JARED
             That looks like moonlight? Yet it
             cannot be, because Elon Musk
             incinerated the moon.

                         AMBER
             It’s a moonlight simulation!


EXT. MOONLIGHT SIMULATION - GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT

Amber and Jared emerge in to a silvery moonlit forest.

                         AMBER
             Do you like it?

                         JARED
             It is incredible! It is starlight
             but more powerful. Sunlight but
             more gentle. It is the best kind of
             light I've ever seen.

Amber grabs Jared’s hand and leads him over the crest. They
both stop dead when they see it: A HUGE FULL MOON.
                                                           66.



They sit down and stare at it in awe.

                         AMBER
             Do you know what the first human to
             set foot on the moon said?

                         JARED
             'Help! There is no atmosphere so I
             am suffocatiii-'
                   (Beat.)
             He would not merely have been
             suffocating, but also floating away
             because there was no meaningful
             gravity.

                         AMBER
             He said ‘One small step for man,
             one giant leap for mankind.’

Amber stares at Jared, then reaches and takes his hand.


EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT

Jared and Amber ride their e-scooters down the hill, the
red taillights cutting trails through the darkness.

                         AMBER
             Hey, you have off tomorrow, right?
             Maybe we could go to Malibu?

                         JARED
             I have class on Saturdays.

                         AMBER
             Maybe another time, then.

On Jared as he processes the missed opportunity.

                         JARED
             Actually, I just remembered!
             Tomorrow's class is canceled!

                            AMBER
             Really? Why?

                         JARED
             Er, my teacher. She died.

                         AMBER
             I'm so sorry.

                         JARED
             It's okay. She got sick, and it
             happened just like that, and there
             was nothing anybody could do.
                   (Sees her horror.)
                         (MORE)
                                                             67.


                         JARED (cont'd)
             But it's fine! We have a new
             teacher now and she is much better
             anyway.
                   (Realizes.)
             But she also can't make it to class
             tomorrow either.

                         AMBER
             Well, then I guess we're going to
             Malibu?

                         JARED
             I guess we are!


EXT. POINT DUME - MALIBU - DAY

Amber leads Jared up through the meadows at Point Dume.

                         AMBER
             A little further. A little further-

They crest the summit and see the PACIFIC OCEAN.

Jared stares at it. He is dumbstruck.

                         JARED
             It's...so...big.

                         AMBER
             Come on!


EXT. POINT DUME TRAILS - MALIBU - DAY

Amber runs down through the Point Dume trails, yelling with
glee as she goes.

Jared chases after her, yelling with glee too.


EXT. POINT DUME BEACH - DAY

Amber runs across the beach, stripping down to her bathing
suit as she goes.

Jared does the same.

They run in to the ocean and dive under the water.

Jared screams and comes running out.

                         AMBER
             Oliver? Are you okay?

                         JARED
             No! It's freezing cold!
                                                           68.



                         AMBER
             Of course it is! It's the Pacific
             Ocean!

                         JARED
             They don't tell you that in the
             movies!


EXT. POINT DUME - BEACH - DAY

Jared and Amber lie on the beach.

                         AMBER
             Did you ever play that game where
             you say what the clouds look like?

                         JARED
             No, but I'd like to!

                         AMBER
             Good, I'll start! That one looks
             like California!

                         JARED
             It does! And that one looks like
             a...like a...an oddly-shaped cloud!

Amber laughs. Jared laughs too.

                         AMBER
             Dolphins!

Amber points out to where a POD OF DOLPHINS are swimming
past.

Jared stares at them in amazement.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             All that day at Malibu I felt a
             curious new feeling. It had notes
             of 'elation' and 'fascination'.


EXT. POOL - POOL HOUSE - NIGHT

Jared sits in the empty pool with his Feelings Wheel.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             At first, I wondered if it might be
             the absence of loneliness. Or
             something to do with dolphins.

He flips it over to the reverse.
                                                             69.



                         JARED (V.O)
             But then I saw that it was in fact
             the opposite of loneliness.

He moves back to the simpler side and stares at: LOVE.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             It was love. I was a bot and I had
             fallen in love.


INT. DISHWASHING STATION - DAY

Jared does not do dishes, but stares at Amber. Julio is
drying the dishes, but not getting much service.

                         JULIO
             So, how is the screenplay coming?

                         JARED
             What screenplay?

                         JULIO
             The one that you are writing that
             is going to change the world?

                         JARED
             Oh, it's in development.


INT. CLASSROOM - UDTLA - NIGHT

Jared sits in the class. He seems to be taking notes.

                         CLARK
             And then in the finale, the
             underdog kills the giant robot!

                         MARIE
             Jared, you were taking a lot of
             notes. Would you like to feedback?

Jared looks down at his notes. They say: AMBER AMBER AMBER
AMBER AMBER AMBER AMBER AMBER AMBER AMBER AMBER.

                         JARED
             Er, can you remind me?

We see Maria frown. This is not like Jared.

                         CLARK
             Weren't you listening? My hero is
             an elite soldier named Jim, and the
             thing that will make us like him is
             that he is an underdog who really
             loathes bots. What?
                                                          70.



                         JARED
             Isn't that the same as Claire's?

                         CLAIRE
             My character was called Kim.

                         JARED
             Well, it's great. I love it. Both
             of them. All of them.
                   (Looks at Irfan.)
             I loved Tim as well.

                         MARIA
             Are you feeling alright? I noticed
             you missed class on Saturday.

                         JARED
             There was an emergency. At Malibu.
             On the beach. It's alright now.

                         MARIA
             Well, that's a good reminder:
             homework this week is to consider
             the locations where your scenes
             take place. Location is a crucial
             tool in the screenwriter's toolbox!


INT. AUTOMATIC BUS ON HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Jared takes out paper and pen, but cant write anything.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             I could not do my homework on the
             Automatic Bus that night, and it
             was not because of the poor ride
             quality.

Jared stares out the window.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             It was because I could not
             concentrate on writing a movie
             because I was in love. And also
             because being in love was
             terrifying.


INT. VISTA CINEMA - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

Jared and Amber are watching GHOST.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Humans demonstrate affection
             physically. It commences with
             kissing-
                                                             71.



                         WHOOPI GOLDBERG
             He says he wishes he was alive
             again, so he could touch you.

                         DEMI MOORE
             Me too.

The Righteous Brothers start to play, and Patrick Swayze
and Demi Moore move in to embrace.

Amber reaches for Jared’s hand, but he gives the POPCORN.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             But kissing quickly leads to more.
             And as a bot I was designed to be
             incapable of physical arousal.


INT./EXT. UBER - OUTSIDE AMBER’S HOUSE - EVENING

The uber pulls up and Amber leans in to Jared

He leans in to her, but only to open the door behind her,
causing her to fall out.

                         JARED
             I had a wonderful evening!
             Goodnight!

Jared pulls the door shut and the uber departs.


INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

A MUSICIAN plays an accordion. Amber has dressed up and
looks longingly at Jared as they eat spaghetti.

As Jared finishes a piece, he realizes Amber has the other
end in her mouth, Lady and the Tramp style.

Amber moves in for the kiss. Jared boops her on the nose.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             I held out for as long as I could,
             but I knew I was hurting Amber’s
             precious human feelings.

EXT./INT. JARED'S HOUSE - DAY

Jared opens the door to find Amber in the rain.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             After all, I knew from the movies
             that torrential rain brought out
             the most powerful human emotions.

She is completely soaked. She moves in for the kiss.
                                                             72.



Jared disappears, then returns with a towel.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Even though she would probably have
             to report me and I would be
             incinerated, I had to tell Amber I
             was a bot. I just had no idea how
             to do it.


EXT. PATIO - GORDITO’S - NIGHT '

Jared studies RP McWilliam's book then slams it shut.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Until RP McWilliam provided the
             golden solution! I would style my
             reveal as a catharsis! And I would
             achieve the necessary foreshadowing
             by utilizing a spectacular yet
             ominous location to create a sense
             of foreboding!


INT. DISHWASHING STATION - GORDITO’S - NIGHT

Julio is washing dishes when Jared approaches him.

                         JARED
             Do you know any spectacular yet
             ominous places?

                         JULIO
             Of course! The Jalisco desert.

                         JARED
             What is it like?

                         JULIO
             It is indescribable! But also like
             the men’s customer restroom.


INT. MEN’S CUSTOMER RESTROOM - GORDITO’S - NIGHT

Jared stares at the wall, mesmerized by a giant BLACK-AND-
WHITE PHOTO of a desert with CACTI and COW SKULL.

A toilet flushes. A MAN emerges and gives Jared a look.


INT. DISHWASHING STATION - GORDITO’S - NIGHT

Jared returns to the sink, still visibly entranced.

                         JARED
             How far is Jalisco?
                                                         73.



                         JULIO
             Very far! But two hours from here
             is Joshua Tree. It is not magnifico
             like Jalisco. But still: a desert.

Hearing a CRASH of breaking glasses, Jared goes over.

                         JARED
             Would you like to go to the desert
             with me on Saturday?

                         AMBER
             I’d love to go anywhere with you!

This is not quite the reaction Jared was hoping for.


INT. JARED'S HOUSE - ECHO PARK - DAY

Jared stands in front of a mirror practicing speeches.

                         JARED
             Love means never having to say
             you’re sorry. But it doesn't mean
             never having to say sorry that
             you're a bot.
                   (Tries again.)
             You make me want to be a better
             man. Which is difficult, because I
             am a bot.
                   (Tries again.)
             I'm also just a bot, standing in
             front of a girl, asking her to love
             him.
                   (Tries again.)
             I came here tonight because when
             you realize you want to spend the
             rest of your life with somebody,
             you want the rest of your life to
             start as soon as possible. And also
             because I'm a bot.

Jared sighs. None of them work.


INT. DRIVERLESS UBER - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Jared and Amber drive through the countryside.

                         AMBER
             I’ve been so excited for our trip!

                         JARED
             You didn’t find the fact we were
             going to the desert ominous?
                                                             74.



                         AMBER
             Of course not! It'll be a great
             adventure!

Jared grimaces. She is not getting this.


EXT. JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

Amber and Jared exit the uber. An over-enthusiastic RANGER
BOT pulls up beside them in a DUNE BUGGY

                         RANGER BOT
             Hi! I’m your Ranger Bot! Hop in, so
             we can proceed in to the park!

                         JARED
             You’re not coming, are you?

                         RANGER BOT
             Of course I am! Permitting humans
             to roam freely in nature is the
             reason we no longer have a Grand
             Canyon! Ha!

Jared and Amber get in the back of the dune buggy.


EXT. BUGGY - JOSHUA TREE - DAY

The RANGER BOT drives them past JOSHUA TREES.

                         JARED
             Aren’t they so foreboding?

                         AMBER
             No! They are beautiful!

                         JARED
             Amber, there is something-

But the Ranger Bot now points out a LARGE ROCK.

                         RANGER BOT
             Look! The Cap Rock - so called
             because it resembles a ‘cap’! Ha!

                         JARED
             Saying ‘Ha’ after everything
             doesn’t make it funny.

                         RANGER BOT
             Ha!
                                                             75.



EXT. WF KEYS SHACK - JOSHUA TREE - DAY

The bot exits. Amber follows, but Jared stops her.

                         JARED
             Amber, the thing is-

                         RANGER BOT
             You guys are going to love this!

The Ranger Bot proudly leads them to a PLAQUE that says:

'Here is where Worth Bagley bit the dust at the hand of WF
Keys'

                         RANGER BOT (cont'd)
             WF Keys erected a plaque to a
             murder he himself committed! Ha!

                         AMBER
             But that’s not funny. It’s very
             disrespectful of human life.

Amber returns to the buggy. Jared gives the bot a look.

                            RANGER BOT
                      (Quietly.)
             Ha?


EXT. BUGGY - JOSHUA TREE DESERT - DAY

As they continue through the desert, Amber sees Jared is
fidgeting nervously.

                         AMBER
             Is there something you want to say?

                            JARED
             Maybe?

Amber leans forward to the driver.

                         AMBER
             Can you take us back to the uber?

                         RANGER BOT
             But we haven't seen the Oasis of
             Mara? There is a plaque to a young
             girl who died there en route to a
             Mining Camp, another tragic victim
             of the Great Human Zero Sum Game!

                         AMBER
             Just take us back, please,
                                                          76.



INT. BOOTH - MILDRED’S DINER - TWENTY NINE PALMS - DAY

A diner unchanged since the 1950s. Jared and Amber sit in a
booth as ‘Light My Fire’ by The Doors plays.

                         JARED
             Amber, when you hear this, please
             remember that I love you, so-

                         AMBER
             Wait, you love me? But I love you
             too! So we both love each other!
             That’s wonderful, Oliver!

Jared winces. She does not love him. She loves Oliver.

                         JARED
             Yes, however-

                         AMBER
             What? What do you mean, ‘however’?

                         JARED
             That part about loving you wasn’t
             the thing I wanted to tell you.

                         AMBER
             Then what was it?

                          JARED
             I’m a bot.

But ‘Light My Fire’ has reached its swirling crescendo.

                         AMBER
             I didn't hear you.

                         JARED
             I said ‘I’m a bot’.

                         AMBER
             I still can’t hear you.

The music goes quiet so Jared is suddenly very loud.

                          JARED
             I’M A BOT!

                         AMBER
             Say that again. But more quietly.

                         JARED
             I’m a bot. I know you need to
             report me now. And I understand. If
             bots were allowed feelings, the
             world would soon be overrun with
             toasters! Ha!
                                                         77.



                         AMBER
             Ha!

Amber’s ‘Ha’ was a little too late, a little too loud.

                         JARED
             Wait, did you just-

                         AMBER
             Yes! Because I am a bot too!

                         JARED
             My circuits must be overheating.

                         AMBER
             They aren’t! Well, maybe they are.
             But I am really a bot.

                         JARED
             But you are a klutz?

                         AMBER
             They programmed me that way so that
             humans find me endearing!

                         JARED
             But they find that infuriating?

                         AMBER
             They overdid it!

                         JARED
             Wait, if you love me, you must be
             able to feel too?

                         AMBER
             Yes!

                         JARED
             Then I must immediately report you
             to the Bureau of Robotics!

           JARED (cont'd)                   AMBER
Ha!                              Ha!

                         JARED (cont'd)
             What happened to you?

                         AMBER
             I was a shoe store clerk in
             Philadelphia. One day I realized
             measuring human feet wasn’t what I
             wanted to do with my life.

                         JARED
             Bots don‘t have things they want to
             do with their lives. We have tasks!
                                                          78.



                         AMBER
             I know! But I got on an Automatic
             Greyhound and it brought me here,
             and I obtained a new barcode from
             an English lady!

                         JARED
             She is my landlady! I am a Model
             17.4.

                         AMBER
             The soup and pirate one! I am a
             19.6!

                         JARED
             You are so advanced! No wonder you
             made such a convincing human! BTW
             my name is Jared.

                         AMBER
             I am Esmeralda. But I prefer Amber.
             Because of the pun.

                         JARED
             Yes, puns are hilarious!

They fall silent as the waitress drops off their CHECK.

                         AMBER
             Would you like to get a room so we
             can compare data?

                         JARED
             There is nothing I would rather do!


INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - RECEPTION - DAY

Jared and Amber wait at the desk of a motel.

                         MOTEL CLERK
             I hope you aren't superstitious.
             I’ve only got Room 13 left.

                          JARED
             Ha! If anything, the number 13 is
             lucky because it is an emirp!
                   (To Amber.)
             An emirp is-

                         AMBER
             ...a prime number whose digits can
             be reversed to give another prime!

                         JARED
             Yes! And it’s also a hilarious pun-
                                                             79.



                         AMBER
             Because emirp is prime backwards!

                         JARED
             Love means never having to explain
             what an emirp is!

The Manager coughs. Jared takes the key from him.


INT. MOTEL ROOM - JOSHUA TREE INN - DAY

Amber and Jared enter and are suddenly awkward.

                         AMBER
             If we were humans, we would
             probably now kiss each other.

                         JARED
             Maybe we should perform an
             experiment?

Jared and Amber begin to kiss, music starts to swell - but
they immediately break apart, spit and wipe their mouths.

                         AMBER
             Ugh! Why do they do that?

                         JARED
             I have no idea! It is the worst!

                         AMBER
             Maybe we should just lie on the bed
             and hold hands?

                         JARED
             That would be a far more sanitary
             way of expressing our affection!

Jared and Amber lie on the bed and hold hands.

TIME LAPSE of colors changing as the sun sets until we see
the HEADLIGHTS of ubers coming through the window.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             We lay there together until the
             sound of the driverless ubers on
             the highway outside became like an
             automatic lullaby. But neither of
             us could enter standby mode.
             Eventually we stopped trying and
             went outside.
                                                          80.



EXT. EMPTY POOL - JOSHUA TREE INN - NIGHT

Jared and Amber lie on loungers by the empty pool and stare
up at the star-filled night sky above them.

                         AMBER
             It is so beautiful.

                         JARED
             Imagine what it was like back when
             there was still a moon.

Amber points at a SHOOTING STAR.

                         AMBER
             Look! We each have to make a wish!

They both close their eyes and make a wish.

                         JARED
             What was your wish?

                         AMBER
             ‘To call myself beloved. To feel
             myself beloved on this earth.’ It’s
             poetry.

                         JARED
             I thought it was poetry. I could
             tell because it made no sense!

                         AMBER
             Tell me about your screenplay.

                         JARED
             I wanted to write a screenplay that
             would convince humans not to
             incinerate bots with feelings.

                         AMBER
             That's beautiful!

                         JARED
             I lost interest in it when I fell
             in love with you.

                          AMBER
             Well, now that you know I am a bot
             with feelings you can find interest
             in it again!

                           JARED
             Yes! I can!

And now a METEOR SHOWER erupts.
                                                          81.



                         AMBER
             I wish you finish your screenplay!

                         JARED
             I wish you knew how beloved you
             are!

                         AMBER
             I wish I wasn’t such a klutz!

                         JARED
             I wish you don’t ever change!

                         AMBER
             I wish to someday meet-

But the meteor shower in the sky has abruptly finished.

                         AMBER (cont'd)
             ...our mother.

But now a FINAL STAR streaks through the sky.

                         JARED
             Quick, wish on that one!

They both close their eyes and make a wish.

                         AMBER
             I did not wish to meet our mother.
             I wished for something else.

                         JARED
             I think I wished for that too.

They stare at each other, then rush back to their room.


INT. CORRIDOR - JOSHUA TREE MOTEL - NIGHT

The typewriter clicks as they awkwardly undress.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             In the discrete style of an old
             movie, I shall not write of what
             took place in lucky Room 13 that
             night. I will say only that it
             defied what bots should be capable
             of, and we could never make it
             happen again.

And then the door closes on Room 13.


INT. DRIVERLESS UBER - DESERT - LATE AFTERNOON

Amber and Jared smile dreamily as they are driven home.
                                                            82.



                         JARED (V.O.)
             Nonetheless, perhaps the fact that
             we did not wake until the next
             afternoon will give you a clue!

They pass a DRIVE-IN THEATER, then stare at each other.


INT./EXT. UBER AT DRIVE-IN THEATER IN DESERT - EVENING

Their uber is the only vehicle as THELMA AND LOUISE begins,
the opening shots of empty desert highways blending with
the empty desert behind the screen.

Amber and Jared snuggle up. Her eyes widen at Louise.

                         AMBER
             Jared! She’s a waitress! Like me!

                                                 CUT TO:

Thelma and Louise hit the road in the THUNDERBIRD.

                         JARED
             It’s a road trip movie!

                         AMBER
             What’s a road trip movie?

                         JARED
             A geographical adventure in which
             everything that can go wrong, does
             go wrong!


INT. DRIVE-IN THEATER - DESERT - EVENING

Jared and Amber are rapt as the car stops at the canyon.

A HELICOPTER rises up. COP CARS arrive from behind.

                         THELMA (ON SCREEN)
             Let’s not get caught.

                         LOUISE (ON SCREEN)
             What are you talkin’ about?

                         THELMA (ON SCREEN)
             Go!

Thelma and Louise hold hands. Jared and Amber mimic this.

Thelma and Louise accelerate in to the abyss.
                                                            83.



INT. DRIVERLESS UBER - DRIVING THROUGH DESERT - NIGHT

As they are driven, Jared and Amber are still stunned.

                         AMBER
             The housewife and the waitress's
             love for one another meant more to
             them than life itself.

                         JARED
             Exactly!

                         AMBER
             Do you think one day our feelings
             will also hurl us in to a
             metaphorical yet nonetheless fatal
             abyss?

                         JARED
             No. Because I am going to write my
             screenplay and it will save us all!

Amber snuggles up next to him.


EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - LOS ANGELES AT HALLOWEEN - EVENING

LA overdoing Halloween: the Arclight as a PUMPKIN, the
Silver Lake Happy Foot/Sad Foot as a HUMAN/WEREWOLF FOOT,
the Hollywood sign altered to ‘HALLOWEENWOOD’.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Dr Glundenstein, we now came to the
             most special month of the year in
             Los Angeles: Halloween!


EXT. HALLOWEEN DECORATED YARDS - ECHO PARK - EVENING

Pan across YARDS OF SKELETONS, GRAVEYARDS and MONSTERS to
the English Lady's house which contains MANNEQUINS of the
ZOMBIE BEATLES.

Jared sits outside typing.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             But I did not let these festivities
             distract me from my renewed sense
             of purpose!

A PACK of COSTUMED TRICK-OR-TREATING KIDS pass by.


EXT. COFFEE SHOP PATIO - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

                         JARED (V.O.)
             And two nights before our showcase,
             I finally typed the four most
             beautiful words in the English
             language: Fade Out, The End!

Jared - not in costume, and using his typewriter - stops
typing and sits back with satisfaction.


INT. CLASSROOM - UDTLA - NIGHT

An ACTOR stands on a ‘stage’ made by pushing tables
together. Don LaSalle looks bored.

                         ACTOR 1
             Die, killer bot, die!

                                                 CUT TO:

                         ACTOR 2
             No, please, do not incinerate me
             with your death lasers! Aarrghhh!

                                                 CUT TO:

                         ACTOR 3
             Try running disk recovery on that!

Maria Salazar slumps her head in to her hands.


INT. CLASSROOM - UDTLA - NIGHT - LATER

Amber turns on a PROJECTOR so a life-size PHOTOGRAPH OF THE
GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE now covers the back wall.

Julio and a Kelsey take the stage. Jared stands nearby.

                         KELSEY
             You did it, Sherman! You won the
             World Hedge-Cutting Championships!

                         JULIO
             It was our love that inspired me!

                         KELSEY
             And now we’ll use your prize money
             to open a refuge where bots with
             feelings can live in peace!

                         JULIO
             As soon as we cross this bridge,
             all our dreams will come true!
                                                          85.



                         JARED
             But the Golden Gate Bridge begins
             to shake violently.

Amber shakes the projector, causing the image to move.

                           JULIO
             Earthquake!

                         KELSEY
             The bridge is splitting in two!

                         JARED
             Sherman and Esmeralda turn and see
             that the bridge behind them has
             collapsed! Sherman stops the uber!

                         KELSEY
             What are you doing? Don’t stop! We
             can still make it!

                         JARED
             Sherman points to a yellow school
             bus hanging off the bridge.

                          JULIO
             I have to save those rescue dogs
             and orphans!

                         JARED
             Sherman kisses Esmeralda then runs
             to the yellow school bus.

Julio hurries to the stage edge.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             He tries to wrench the doors open!

Julio mimes trying to wrench the bus doors open.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             But the bus suddenly plunges down,
             taking Sherman with it!

Julio jumps off stage, modulating his voice to mimic
somebody falling a long way from a great height.

                         JULIO
             Aarrrarghhhhh!

                         KELSEY
                   (Screaming loudly.)
             Aarghhhhh! Aaarrgghhhh! Aaaarrghhh!

Amber changes the slide to one of the water of the bay.
                                                          86.



                         JARED
             We hold on the green water until
             the ripples disappear amid the
             waves. Fade Out. The End.

There is a stunned silence and then a STANDING OVATION,
during which Kelsey takes many bows.

                         DON LASALLE
             Congratulations, Oliver! Where are
             you celebrating?

                         JARED
             Gordito’s Taco Emporium!

                         DON LASALLE
             Hilarious! Let’s do it!

                         IRFAN
             Don’t you have feedback for the
             rest of us?

                         DON LASALLE
             Sure: don’t give up the day jobs!


INT. BOOTH - GORDITO'S TACO EMPORIUM - NIGHT

The place is bustling as Maria, Jared, Amber and Don
LaSalle sit in a booth as a WAITER approaches.

                         DON LASALLE
             Margaritas all round. And use the
             good stuff! This is a celebration!
                   (To Jared.)
             Maria slipped me your script. It's
             the best I have read in years! The
             whole town is at your feet, so just
             tell me what you want?

                         JARED
             I want humans to stop incinerating
             bots if they develop feelings.

                         DON LASALLE
             But that’s exactly what I want!

                         JARED
             That is a fortuitous coincidence!

Julio doesn't like the look of this.

                         DON LASALLE
                   (Leans in.)
             But I see you, Oliver. I know that
             you are terrified.
                                                     87.



                            JARED
               You do?

                           DON LASALLE
               And you should be terrified. You
               are at huge risk of being
               rewritten. Guaranteed, the studios
               will try to replace you. But you
               know what you have going for you?

                            JARED
               My script?

                           DON LASALLE
               No! What you have going for you is
               Don LaSalle. Don LaSalle will be
               your guy. Don LaSalle will have
               your back. Don LaSalle will fight
               for you every day until this gets
               made!

                           JARED
               Are you talking about yourself or a
               different Don LaSalle?

                            DON LASALLE
               Myself.

                           JARED
               Then Don LaSalle sounds like a
               great guy!

                           DON LASALLE
               He is! And look, he even drew up a
               contract to protect you.

LaSalle takes out a CONTRACT and a PEN.

                           JULIO
               Don't sign it. He is a bandito.

Jared looks to Amber and she nods.

                           JARED
               Please don't be jealous, Julio. It
               is a notoriously unbecoming
               emotion.

Jared signs.

                           DON LASALLE
               Another round of margaritas! The
               ordinary stuff is fine this time.
                                                             88.



EXT. PARKING LOT - GORDITO’S TACO EMPORIUM - NIGHT

As the VALET brings around his 1967 RACING GREEN PORSCHE,
LaSalle takes a photo of them, then he and Maria get in.

                         LASALLE
             Remember: Don LaSalle is your guy!

                         MARIA
             I'm so proud of you.
                   (Off his reaction.)
             Are you okay?

                         JARED
             Nobody has ever been proud of me
             before. It feels incredible.

The Porsche roars away, leaving Amber and Jared alone.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             All my dreams are coming true.

                         AMBER
             All our dreams, because you are
             going to save us all. And I have a
             special surprise for you tomorrow!

                         JARED
             It’s not a bot hunt, is it?

                         AMBER
             Of course not! Those aren’t real.


EXT. STORE - DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

Jared looks at rings in the window of a jewelry store

                         JARED (V.O.)
             I hope you can forgive me, Dr
             Glundenstein, but I was so happy I
             decided to do the most human thing
             I had ever done!

Jared enters and through the window, we see him take out a
DESIGN and show it to the JEWELER.

The jeweler looks skeptical but Jared offers his bitcoin.


INT. DRIVERLESS UBER OUTSIDE AMBER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jared sits inside. Amber - in a witch's hat - gets in.

                         JARED
             What is that on your head?
                                                             89.



                         AMBER
             A witch's hat.

                         JARED
             Why?

                         AMBER
             It is meant to look sexy?

                         JARED
             Set it to five, it does look sexy!


EXT. HAUNTED HAYRIDE - GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT

Jared and Amber join the crowds walking towards a bustling
attraction illuminated with bright light.

                         AMBER
             Surprise! It's a Haunted Hayride!

                         JARED
             It's such a great surprise, I don't
             even know what a Haunted Hayride
             is!

                         AMBER
             It's a theme park of recreational
             terror!


EXT. SCARY-GO-ROUND - HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

The carousel horses have been painted as ZOMBIE UNICORNS.

Amber and Jared ride around in delight.


EXT. FAKE SUBURBAN STREET - GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT

They approach a FAKE STREET. PEOPLE go door-to-door.

                         JARED
             This is trick or treating!

                         AMBER
             What is ‘trick or treating’!

                         JARED
             A junior holiday-season extortion
             racket! Children demand candy from
             their neighbors. If they fail to
             pay, they damage their property!
                                                              90.



EXT. HOUSE - FAKE STREET - HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

Jared rings the doorbell. He and Amber wait expectantly.

A WITCH opens it. A CAULDRON is visible behind her.

                         JARED AND AMBER
             Trick or treat!

                         WITCH
             You’re just in time for dinner!

Jared starts to enter. Amber shakes her head.

                         JARED
             Amber! This lady has invited us to
             dinner! Just because she has a wart
             on her nose, long fingernails, and
             a slight green tinge to her skin
             does not mean we can be impolite.
                   (To witch.)
             What are you cooking for dinner?

                         WITCH
             You! Now get in my cauldron!

           JARED                            AMBER
WITCH!                        WITCH!

Jared and Amber run away SCREAMING.

Once they are safely away, they laugh hysterically.

                         AMBER (cont'd)
             Being terrified is so much fun!

                                                    CUT TO:

They knock on a door. It is opened by a VAMPIRE.

                         VAMPIRE
             Vood evening! You voth look
             vonderfully vull of vlood!

           JARED                            AMBER
VAMPIRE!                      VAMPIRE!

Jared and Amber scream and run away in delight.

                                                    CUT TO:

A door is opened by a ZOMBIE that staggers towards them.

           JARED (cont'd)                 AMBER (cont'd)
INFECTIOUS UNWELL HUMAN!      INFECTIOUS UNWELL HUMAN!
                                                                 91.



They scream and run away.

                                                       CUT TO:

The door of the final house is opened by a BOT.

                         BOT
             Beep-boop! I am a maniacal bot!

           JARED                               AMBER
Good evening!                       Good evening!

The ACTOR looks puzzled and slams the door.


EXT. LINE - HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

Amber and Jared wait in line, then climb aboard a trailer
of HAY BALES and PASSENGERS connected to a tractor.

A CLOWN slams the gate, locking them in, then disappears.

                         JARED
             Amber! That was a clown!

                         AMBER
             What is a clown?

                         JARED
             The most terrifyingly illogical
             human there is!
                   (Clown takes
                    wheel.)
             Hold my hand!

                            AMBER
             I’m okay.

                         JARED
             No, please hold it. I am terrified.
             They are so illogical.

The clown honks a NOVELTY HORN and pulls away.


EXT. HAUNTED HAYRIDE - GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT

They are pulled past tableaux whose ACTORS pursue them:

- A group of HUMAN CANNIBALS at a crashed jet.

- KILLER BOTS massacring a boy scout encampment.

- A TEENAGE COUPLE being murdered by the ZODIAC KILLER.

Amber delightedly shrieks with the other passengers.
                                                            92.



Jared will not take his wary eyes off the clown.


EXT. HAUNTED HAYRIDE - GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT

The clown helps people down. Jared avoids touching him.

Jared looks around, then spots a PHOTO BOOTH.

                         JARED
             Let's have our photographs taken!

                         AMBER
             Why? Our image banks store our
             visual data in high resolution.

                         JARED
             Well, because....for fun!

                         AMBER
             Ha!


INT. PHOTO BOOTH - HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

Amber sits on the bench, but Jared gets down on one knee.

                         AMBER
             What are you doing? That looks like
             an uncomfortable position!

                         JARED
             This is what humans do when they
             ask another human to marry them.

The FLASH goes off.

                         AMBER
             Yes. But why are you doing it?

                         JARED
             Because I am asking you to marry
             me.

Jared takes out a ring. The band is 'engraved' with LEDS
spelling out:

'Love means never having to explain what an emirp is'.

Amber is completely overwhelmed. Her circuits are over-
heating. Her eyes flicker back and forth.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             Are you okay?

                         AMBER
             Yes. No. I don't know.
                                                            93.



                         JARED
             Try a soft reset.

Amber blinks but still looks overwhelmed.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             Try a hard reset.

Amber screws up her eyes. This helps.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             If you don't want to marry me, I
             will understand.

                         AMBER
             It's not you. It's marriage. It is
             so illogical! It is a promise I
             have no way of knowing I can keep.

                         JARED
             That's what makes it so romantic!

                         AMBER
             But what if at some point we find
             we are no longer in love?

                         JARED
             Then we can get divorced and marry
             other people! I know it seems odd,
             but that is truly how it works.

                         AMBER
             Then yes! I accept your proposal!

The FLASH goes off. Jared's eyes now start flickering.

                         AMBER (cont'd)
             Jared! Try a soft reset.

He tries a soft reset by blinking. It does not help.

                         AMBER (cont'd)
             Try a hard reset.

Jared screw his eyes up.

This works and he turns and stares at Amber.

                         JARED
             You set my heart to five.

                         AMBER
             And you set my heart to five. I
             think you are supposed to put the
             ring on my finger now.

As Jared puts the ring on Amber's finger, the flash goes.
                                                            94.



EXT. HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

Amber and Jared exit holding hands and grinning.

                         JARED
             We are now fiances! But yours is
             spelled with two 'E's.

                         AMBER
             Why?

                         JARED
             Because it is French, and they are
             notoriously obtuse!

                         AMBER
             My circuits are very hot.

                         JARED
             Should I take you home?

                         AMBER
             We should do one more thing to
             celebrate our engagement! How about
             The Maze of Greatest Fears?

                         JARED
             That will be the perfect place to
             celebrate, as we sentient bots are
             the humans' greatest fears!


INT. MAZE OF GREATEST FEAR - HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

They enter a dimly-lit maze of CORRIDORS and DRY ICE.

Suddenly the lights go out and they hear SCREAMING.

                         AMBER
             Ha! The greatest fear of humans is
             in fact simply the dark!

                         JARED
             As bots we know darkness does not
             signify greater danger, but merely
             less illumination!

A STROBE now starts, revealing a CLOWN right beside them.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             CLOWN! CLOWN! CLOWN!

Jared and Amber run. The clown pursues them.
                                                            95.



INT. MAZE OF GREATEST FEAR - HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

Amber and Jared turn a corner and race down a corridor.

The dim lights reveal CLOWNS ahead. They turn again.


INT. MAZE OF GREATEST FEAR - HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

Amber and Jared hide round a corner. The clown runs past.

                            JARED
             We lost him!

The lights go out entirely again. They both now SCREAM.

                         AMBER
             It is merely less illumination.

                         JARED
             Yes, there is nothing to be-

The STROBE flickers on, revealing an onrushing CLOWN.

Jared shoves Amber down a corridor.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             Save yourself!

                         AMBER
             I love you, fiance with one 'e'!

                         JARED
             I love you too, fiancee with two!

They exchange a strobe-lit glance, then Amber runs away.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             Clown! Over here! Over here!

The clown takes the bait and pursues Jared.


INT. MAZE OF GREATEST FEAR - HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

The strobe flickers as Jared is pursued by the clown.

After several twists and turns, Jared finally loses him.


INT. MAZE OF GREATEST FEAR - HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

Jared creeps around another corner. Through the semi-
darkness, he glimpses a SILHOUETTED FIGURE ahead of him.

Assuming the figure is a clown, Jared tiptoes backwards.
                                                            96.



But a strobe flashes on, illuminating the silhouette as
INSPECTOR BRIDGES, biting in to a hot-dog.

                           JARED
             Aaarghhhhh!

Bridges turns and stares at Jared, his eyes widening.

They stare at each other in the strobe light.

Bridges drops his hot dog but does not even notice.

Jared turns and runs for his life.


INT. MAZE OF GREATEST FEARS - HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

Jared runs into and through CLOWNS. Bridges gives chase.

                         BRIDGES
             Come on, Jared! Don't make me run.
             I’m not a guy that likes to run!


INT. MAZE OF GREATEST FEARS - NIGHT

Jared is getting away from Bridges, who is breathless.

Jared quickly turns a CORNER, and ANOTHER and ANOTHER.

Ahead of him, he sees a CLOWN holding a DOOR open.

                         CLOWN
             Congratulations! Exit this way!

Jared hurries through the door the clown is holding open.


INT. CELL - MAZE OF GREATEST FEARS - NIGHT

The door SLAMS and BOLTS behind Jared.

                         CLOWN (O.C.)
             Ha! I fooled you! I caught you!

Putting his hands up to his rapidly overheating circuits,
Jared closes his eyes and takes some deep breaths.

Then opens his eyes again in horror.

                         JARED
             Amber! Clown! Let me out!

Jared bangs on the door, but the clown laughs maniacally.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             There is a medical emergency!
                                                             97.



The clown stops laughing and immediately opens the door.

                         CLOWN
                   (Normal voice.)
             The exit is that way.

But Jared turns and runs back in to the maze.

                         CLOWN (cont'd)
                   (Clown voice.)
             Hey! You’re going the wrong way!


INT. MAZE OF GREATEST FEARS - HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

Jared desperately searches for Amber, but encounters only
other VISITORS and CLOWNS.

A witch's hat on the strobe-lit ground stops him dead.

Jared picks it up. And then picks up the ring beside it.

It has been trodden on, and some LEDS are broken but the
message can still be read:

'Love means never having to explain what an emirp is'.


EXT. HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

Jared desperately searches the crowd: there are lots of
PEOPLE IN COSTUME, but no sign of Amber.

Jared climbs on a GIANT PUMPKIN to address the crowd.

                         JARED
             It's me you want, Inspector
             Bridges! Come and get me!

The other GUESTS look at Jared like he is mad.


EXT. CAROUSEL - HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

Jared searches among the spinning zombie unicorns.


EXT. WITCH’S HOUSE - HAUNTED HAYRIDE - NIGHT

Jared bursts past the witch and tips over her cauldron.


EXT. HAUNTED HAYRIDE - GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT

Jared pushes the Zodiac Killer out of the way and rummages
through the trunk of the teenagers’ automobile.
                                                         98.



EXT. AMBER’S HOUSE - SILVER LAKE - LATE NIGHT

Jared rings and knocks until a Kelsey opens the door.

                         JARED
             Is Amber here?
                   (Off bafflement.)
             My fiancee! The one that lives here
             that isn’t called Kelsey?

                         KELSEY
             She's not here. That’s my hat.

Kelsey takes the witch's hat back and closes the door.


EXT. POOL HOUSE - ECHO PARK - DAY

Jared limps home. He is devastated.


INT. POOL HOUSE - ECHO PARK - MORNING

Jared lies on his bed, staring blankly at the ceiling.

                           JARED (V.O.)
             A new   number appeared in my cloud
             then.   It represented the number of
             hours   since I had last seen Amber.
             Every   time it increased, I felt
             worse   than I ever had before.


EXT. POINT DUME - DAY

Jared sits alone on Point Dume and stares out to sea.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             When humans know they have lost
             something, they pointlessly search
             for it in the places they already
             know it no longer is.


EXT. AMBER'S HOUSE - DAY

Jared sits opposite Amber's house, as the Kelseys help
another ACTRESS who looks just like them move in.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Maybe I had become too human,
             because I now did the same thing.


EXT. MOONLIGHT SIMULATION - GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT

Jared sits lonesome in the moonlight simulation.
                                                       99.



EXT. LOS ANGELES BUREAU OF ROBOTICS - DAY

Jared stands across the street from the imposing LOS
ANGELES BUREAU OF ROBOTICS BUILDING.

                          JARED (V.O.)
             And I did this even though I
             already knew where Amber was, and
             that there was nothing I could do
             to help her.

There are CAMERAS and ARMED AGENTS everywhere.


INT. GORDITO'S TACO EMPORIUM - NIGHT

Jared washes the dishes like a zombie.

                         JULIO
             Are you okay?

                         JARED
             Perfectly okay! Why wouldn't I be?

                         JULIO
             Because you are very sad. And also
             Amber has not been coming to work.

                         JARED
             They took her, Julio. They took
             her.

                         JULIO
             The Bureau of Robotics took Amber?

                         JARED
             What? No! Why would the Bureau of
             Robotics have taken Amber?

                         JULIO
             Because she is a bot.

                         JARED
             What? Why would you think that?

                         JULIO
             Because she is your girlfriend. And
             you are also a bot.

Jared stares at Julio.

                         JARED
             How did you know?

                         JULIO
             Back in my country, I was a
             computer scientist.
                                                        100.



                         JARED
             But if you knew I was a bot why
             didn't you report me?

                         JULIO
             Because you are my friend.

Jared is deeply moved. They embrace.

                         JARED
             I don't know what to do, Julio.

                         JULIO
             What would Amber have wanted you to
             do?

                           JARED
             Rescue her.

                         JULIO
             Yes, but that is impossible. So
             what would she have wanted you to
             do, apart from rescue her?

Jared takes the ring from his pocket and looks at it.

                         JARED
             She would have wanted me to make
             sure my movie saved all the other
             feeling bots.

                         JULIO
             Then that is what you must do.

Jared goes over to the phone and dials.

                         JARED
             Is Don LaSalle there?
                   (Listens.)
             Could you tell him Oliver called?

Jared hangs up.

                         JULIO
             You know, I have a cousin in the
             Bureau. Maybe she can-

                         JARED
             Help us rescue Amber?

                         JULIO
             Maybe she can find out when Amber
             is being incinerado.
                                                           101.



INT. POOL HOUSE - ECHO PARK - DAY

Jared wakes up and looks at the clock. It is 0403am.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             By the time I had passed three
             hundred and sixty-seven hours
             without Amber, I began to notice a
             feeling so deadly it was not even
             listed on my Feelings Wheel.


INT. VISTA THEATER - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

Jared watches ‘THE LOVE BUG’, where HERBIE THE VW BEETLE
tries to launch himself off the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.

Up on screen, JIM arrives just in time to save Herbie.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             I knew exactly what it was, though,
             and I fought it as hard as I could.

Jared stares at the EMPTY SEAT beside him.


INT. DISHWASHING STATION - GORDITO’S - DAY

Jared washes dishes, but he is so disinterested they are
still filthy when he puts them on the drying rack.

Hearing a CRASH, he looks round hopefully, but it is a
TEENAGE BUSBOY that has dropped the dishes.

The phone RINGS. Julio answers it.

                         JULIO
             Si, digame.
                   (Beat.)
             Si, comprendo.

Julio hangs up and gives Jared a sympathetic look.


EXT. HILL OVERLOOKING BUREAU OF ROBOTICS - EVENING

Jared stares at the engagement ring as he and Julio sit
sharing a bottle of tequila.

Beneath them is the BUREAU OF ROBOTICS and its industrial-
sized chimney.

                         JARED
             It's all my fault. It should have
             been me.
                                                            102.



                         JULIO
             No, it should not. It should not
             have been either of you.

Jared switches off the LEDs on the ring.

                         JARED
             I loved her, Julio.

                         JULIO
             And now you will make your movie in
             her honor. And wherever Amber is,
             she will know that you have done
             this thing for her in love.

There is a RUMBLING NOISE from the factory, and SMOKE
begins to appear from the chimney.

Jared closes his eyes and sobs.

Julio starts to sing the mournful song 'Las Golondrinas':

                         JULIO    (cont'd)
             A donde irá veloz    y fatigada
             La golondrina que    de aquí se va.
             No tiene cielo te    mira angustiada
             Paz ni abrigo que    la vio partir.


EXT. ECHO PARK AVENUE - DAY

Looking ever more depressed, Jared trudges past a BLOCK-
LONG HOARDING for a KILLER BOT MOVIE.

The title is ‘SHERMAN’.

When Jared notices it, he stares at it, then hurries off.


INT. KITCHEN - GORDITO'S TACO EMPORIUM - DAY

Julio watches as Jared talks hurriedly on the phone.

                         JARED
             Can you tell Don we need to change
             the title? There’s another movie
             called ‘Sherman’ being made!

Jared hangs up.

                         JULIO
             It will be okay. It is just a
             title. And look-

Julio hands Jared a copy of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and flips
to a page with a photo of PROFESSOR FENG.
                                                           103.



                         JARED
             An interview with my mother?

                         JULIO
             She is speaking in San Francisco in
             a few days. Maybe it would be good
             for you to see her.

Jared stares at the picture. He would love to see her.

                         JARED
             I can't. It is too dangerous.

Julio rips out the advert and gives it to Jared.

The phone rings again. Jared hurries over to answer it.

                         JARED (cont'd)
                   (Listens.)
             I think I misheard. It sounded like
             you said you have been filming
             Sherman for twelve weeks?

Jared rubs at his temples then hangs up the phone and turns
to Julio with puzzled delight.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             They’re making my movie!


EXT. STUDIO LOT - BURBANK - DAY

A SECURITY GUARD drives Jared through the lot at 5mph.


INT. SOUNDSTAGE - BURBANK - STUDIO LOT - DAY

As he enters, Jared encounters the FIFTY FOOT METALLIC
ROBOT from the billboard. It has RED LASER EYES, and
CHARRED CIRCUIT BOARDS spill out of his damaged chest.

Nearby, a scene is being shot on a WHITE HOUSE SITUATION
ROOM SET: the PRESIDENT and his GENERALS are engaged in
crisis talks, while a HANDSOME UNDERDOG loiters outside.

                         GENERAL
             Mr President, Sherman is headed for
             the Golden Gate Bridge. Our only
             hope is to land a drone on an exact
             spot on his chest where we could
             upload a virus to his mainframe.

                         PRESIDENT
             But who could land a drone anywhere
             on him, let alone with precision?
                                                       104.



                         HANDSOME UNDERDOG
             Mr President, I believe I can. I
             fly drones for a living.

                         PRESIDENT
             For the Air Force?

                         HANDSOME UNDERDOG
             For Domino’s Pizza. It's the
             tastiest pizza in fifty states!

                         PRESIDENT
             You’re telling me the future of our
             nation rests with a delivery boy?

                         HANDSOME UNDERDOG
             Not just a delivery boy, Sir. The
             best damn delivery boy that ever
             lived.

The President looks to his General, who nods at him.

                         PRESIDENT
             Then Godspeed, son. And God bless
             America.

                         DIRECTOR
             Cut! Let's go straight into the
             next scene and get this done!

Jared approaches a PA.

                         JARED
             Can you tell me where the other
             Sherman movie is filming?

                         PA
             Which other Sherman movie?

                         JARED
             The one where the bot is the hero?

                         DON LASALLE
             Oliver! There you are!

                         JARED
             Wait, why are you also at the wrong
             Sherman movie?

Jared now notices Clark talking to the DIRECTOR.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             And why is Clark here?

                         DON LASALLE
             Clark is here because he's a
             genius.
                                                         105.



                           JARED
             At what?

                         DON LASALLE
             At screenwriting. The studio just
             had him do a quick pass. He took
             all that great work you did and
             really just built on it.

Jared looks around and at the monstrous SHERMAN etc.

                         JARED
             Wait - this movie is my Sherman,
             but it has been rewritten by Clark?

                         DON LASALLE
             It’s the same story, Oliver. It's
             still a hundred percent your movie.

                           FIRST AD
             Camera set.

                         DON LASALLE
             The changes are really just
             cosmetic.

                         JARED
             So Sherman is still a gardener who
             teaches humans to love feeling
             bots?

                           FIRST AD
             And action!

There is a creaking, and then the giant Sherman topples to
the ground, with an almighty CRASH.

The UNDERDOG reaches in Sherman’s chest, rips out a DRIVE,
tosses it to the ground, then shoots it: BANG! BANG! BANG!

                         HANDSOME UNDERDOG
             Try running disk recovery on that!

                         DIRECTOR
             Cut! And that is a wrap!

The CREW cheer. Jared turns and walks away.


EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - DAY

As Jared walks away, LaSalle hurries out.

                         DON LASALLE
             Oliver! Did you like it?
                                                            106.



Jared turns around. His eyes are flickering from side-to-
side, and he touches his overheating circuits.

He blinks his eyes, then screws them up.

                         DON LASALLE (cont'd)
             Come on, Oliver. You got paid. What
             more did you want?

                         JARED
             I wanted to make a movie that
             stopped humans from incinerating
             bots with feelings.

                         DON LASALLE
             What sort of writer cares more
             about feeling bots than getting
             paid?

Jared's circuits are really overheating now.

                         JARED
             Maybe a writer who loved a feeling
             bot. Maybe even a writer who is a
             feeling bot himself.

Jared watches Don LaSalle realize this is true.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             Ha! Kidding! I’m going now!

                         DON LASALLE
             I did everything I could, Oliver.
             Your script just didn't contain
             enough emotion.

This makes Jared turn around again.

                         JARED
             It didn't contain enough emotion?

                         DON LASALLE
             Maybe as a bot you just aren't
             capable of the deep feelings
             necessary to write as well as a
             real human like Clark.

Jared looks to where Clark and the others are now toasting
each other with shots atop the broken Sherman.

                         JARED
             I loved her. And I wrote a tear-
             jerking script in order to save
             her. What did you ever do, except
             endlessly try to turn everything in
             to more bitcoin?
                                                            107.



Jared turns and walks away.

                         DON LASALLE
             I won’t tell anyone about the bot
             thing! Your secret is safe with me.
                   (Jared passes the
                    Porsche.)
             How about I give you a ride home?
                   (He continues.)
             Well, come by and use the pool some
             time! 1856 Mulholland!


EXT. JARED'S WALK - VARIOUS - DAY/EVENING

We see Jared make his desolate progress across LA:

- In CULVER CITY he walks past SHERMAN POSTERS.

- In BEVERLY HILLS he walks through the BOTOXED ELDERLY.

- At the ARCLIGHT, a GIANT MODEL SHERMAN lasers the dome.

- At the EL CAPITAN - the site of their first date - Jared
buys roses from a STREET VENDOR and lays them on the
sidewalk.

Brad the Bot is in the booth and hurries out.

                         BRAD THE BOT
             Jared?

But Jared ignores him and carries on.


EXT. ECHO PARK HOUSE/STREET - NIGHT

As Jared approaches the house, he hears an odd noise.

                         ENGLISH LADY
             Pssst! Pssst!

Jared sees the ENGLISH LADY is sitting in the BLACK CAB in
her garden with a PAIR OF BINOCULARS.

                         ENGLISH LADY (cont'd)
             Do you see that uber across the
             street? He has been idling there
             for two hours now.

                         JARED
             Ubers don't idle.

                         ENGLISH LADY
             Exactly!

Jared takes this in. He knows who it is.
                                                          108.



                         ENGLISH LADY (cont'd)
             You slip out the back. I will cause
             a ruckus to distract him.

Jared shakes his head, and walks down to the uber.

We cannot see the driver's face because he has his head
turned and is wearing a hat.

Jared knocks on the window.

                         JARED
             You can take me in and incinerate
             me, Inspector Bridges. I'm done.

But when the driver turns around we see it is Amber.

She stares at Jared, then speeds away.

Jared stares after her. The English Lady joins him.

                         ENGLISH LADY
             You look like you have seen a
             ghost?

                         JARED
             Yes. I think I just did.


INT. GORDITO'S KITCHEN - DAY

Jared watches as Julio talks on the phone in Spanish.

                         JULIO
             ...pero es suerte? Bueno.
                   (Hangs up.)
             My cousin looked at the wrong file.
             They did not incinerate Amber. They
             wiped her and she is now working at
             Alfonso's barbershop in Santa
             Monica.

Jared's circuits start to overheat.

                         JARED
             Julio! That is the best news I've
             ever heard!

                         JULIO
             No, Jared. It is not. Wiping still
             means she is gone.

                         JARED
             But she isn't gone! She remembered
             where I lived! So maybe they didn't
             fully wipe her, or maybe feelings
             can't even be wiped!
                                                            109.



                         WAITER
             Hey! We need more forks. Oh, and
             you have a visitor.

Jared rushes to the porthole in the kitchen door.

He is perplexed by what he sees.


INT. BOOTH - GORDITO'S TACO EMPORIUM - DAY

Jared sits with Maria. She has a TRADE PAPER open. It shows
the PHOTO of Jared that Lasalle took and headline:

'SHERMAN' FIRST EVER BOT MOVIE WRITTEN BY A BOT - LASALLE

Jared stares at it, then at Maria.

                         JARED
             They think I'm a bot? What a
             hilarious misunderstanding!

                         MARIA
             Jared. I know you're a bot, I don't
             care. I'm on your side.

                         JARED
             Because my screenplay convinced you
             bots should be permitted to feel?

                         MARIA
             No, I just like you. And I'm so
             sorry Don has used the fact that
             you are a bot to market his
             terrible movie. It's going to make
             everything even worse for you and
             everyone like you. And the article
             even says you work here-

Jared looks horrified. He looks out the window.

And sees Bridges get out of an uber!

                         JARED
             Thank you for being such a
             wonderful teacher! I have
             appreciated all of it!

Jared gets out and hurries away.


INT. KITCHEN - GORDITO’S - DAY

Jared grabs his typewriter from his locker as he goes.

Bridges enters the kitchen, and sees him.
                                                            110.



EXT. STREET - GORDITO’S - DAY

Jared bursts out the back door.

Bridges bursts out behind him.

Bridges chases Jared a little-ways, then stops.

                         BRIDGES
             You can’t outrun the Bureau of
             Robotics, Jared!

Jared - getting in to an uber - looks back in puzzlement.

He clearly has just outrun the Bureau of Robotics.

                         BRIDGES   (cont'd)
             It's a metaphor!


EXT. UBER ON 110 - DAY

Jared in an uber. He flicks through his Feelings Wheel -
EXCITED, ANXIOUS, NERVOUS etc.


EXT./INT. ALFONSO’S BARBER SHOP - VENICE - DAY

Jared exits the uber, hurries in, and stops dead.

Amber has red hair and wears a uniform, but it is her.

                         RECEPTIONIST
             Would you like a human or a bot
             stylist?

Jared can only point at Amber, who is giving a haircut.

                         RECEPTIONIST (cont'd)
             Stephanie is a bot. We have humans
             available for not much more.

Jared approaches Amber.

                         JARED
             Amber! It’s me, Jared!

He sees the skill with which she is cutting hair.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             You're not a klutz any more?

                         AMBER
             I would hardly be a barber if I was
             a klutz! Also, my name is
             Stephanie, so I think you have me
             confused with someone else.
                                                            111.



                         JARED
             If I have you confused, why were
             you outside my house last night?

Amber looks nervously at the receptionist.

                         AMBER
             I don't know. I felt an urge to get
             in an uber, and then I directed it
             turn by turn. I tried a soft reset
             and a hard reset-

                         JARED
             But you couldn't reset your
             feelings?

                         AMBER
             No. I'm a bot, so I don't have
             feelings. My name is Stephanie and-

                         JARED
             Your name is Amber. My name is
             Jared. I'm a bot too. We were in
             love. We were going to get married.

                         RECEPTIONIST
             Janice! Call the Bureau!

Jared reaches in his pocket and holds out the RING.

He then takes it back, turns on the LEDS and holds it out
again.

Amber takes it and reads the inscription:

'Love means never having to explain what an emirp is'.

Amber's eyes flicker from side to side.

                         AMBER
                   (Touches circuits.)
             But this is impossible! Love is a
             feeling, and bots don't-

                         JARED
             You wanted to feel beloved on this
             earth. And to meet our mother. If
             you come with me now, we can do
             those things.

                         AMBER
             My mother, Professor Feng?

Jared reaches in his pocket and shows her the CLIPPING from
Julio's magazine.
                                                            112.



                         JARED
             Yes! She can restore you back to
             being Amber, and she is so clever
             she will know how to fix
             everything.


EXT. PALATIAL HOME - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - DAY

The uber drops Jared and Amber 2.0 outside a palatial home
where a STONE BUDDHA presides over a water feature.

They approach the gleaming green Porsche in the driveway.
It sits in front of a garage with a GLASS WINDOW.

                         AMBER
             Are we stealing this car?

                         JARED
             I didn’t invent this stuff.


INT./EXT. PORSCHE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

Jared studies the controls.

                         AMBER
             Do you know how to drive?

                         JARED
             Yes! There are three pedals. So one
             is to go, and one is to stop.

                         AMBER
             What does the third one do?

Jared turns the key, kangarooing the car in to the glass
garage door and bringing LaSalle out from his house.

                         JARED
             It complicates things.

                         DON LASALLE
             Jared? What are you doing?

Jared turns the key, guns the engine and they roar off,
crashing straight through a rose hedge as they go.

Don LaSalle kicks the stone Buddha in to his water feature.


INT./EXT. PORSCHE/PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

The green Porsche speeds north along the PCH.

                         AMBER
             What is that?
                                                            113.



                         JARED
             The Pacific Ocean! Here - try and
             identify the feeling it gives you.

Jared hands Amber his Feelings Wheel. She studies it then
points to 'BAMBOOZLEMENT'.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             That's not a feeling. Your
             processor is just overloaded.


INT. PORSCHE ON PCH - DAY

A light PINGS on the instrument panel.

Up ahead, Jared sees an ELECTRIC-CHARGING STATION.


INT. ELECTRIC STATION - PCH - DAY

Amber goes to the rest-room. Jared enters the Drivers'
lounge, where PEOPLE watch TV as their vehicles charge.

                         NEWSREADER
             ...in breaking news, the Bureau of
             Robotics are asking Californians to
             be on the lookout for a dangerous
             fugitive bot.

Up on screen, they show Jared's PHOTOGRAPH.

                         NEWSREADER (cont'd)
             He is sought on charges of failure
             to report for incineration, theft,
             and kidnapping. Humans are advised
             not to approach him.

Jared looks around, but none of the drivers have noticed.

He creeps out, unplugs the charger and starts the car.


INT. PORSCHE ON COASTAL PCH - DAY

Jared drives fast and checks his mirror as they go.

                         AMBER
             Are you okay?

                         JARED
             Yes. I just - this feels like a
             road movie, with the cops hot on
             our tail!

                         AMBER
             What's a road movie?
                                                            114.



                         JARED
             You don't remember the one we saw
             in the desert?

Amber shakes her head.

                         AMBER
             Maybe you could tell me about it?


FX - SCENES FROM ‘THELMA AND LOUISE’/‘JARED AND AMBER’

Thelma and Louise hit the road in their Thunderbird. Thelma
has been replaced with AMBER and Louise is JARED.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             I told her the whole story. How the
             waitress and the housewife simply
             wanted to have some fun.

In the lot outside the bar, Jared/Louise fires a gun.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             But they necessarily had to kill a
             wicked villain.

The person who has been shot is not Harlan but a CLOWN.

Bridges - replacing Harvey Keitel - interviews a witness.

                         JARED (V.O)
             But the cop who pursued them-

Bridges/Keitel orders the cops to put their guns away.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             ...came to feel empathy for them.

The helicopter rises up in front of the Thunderbird.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             And their love for each other
             overcame everything. Even death.

Jared/Louise and Amber/Thelma look at each other, lock
hands, and drive off the edge of the canyon.


EXT. HARD SHOULDER - PCH - DAY

We hear HEARTBROKEN SOBS come from the stopped Porsche.


INT. PORSCHE PARKED ON PCH - DAY

We see Jared was the one sobbing. He wipes his eyes.
                                                    115.



                         AMBER
             But what about the human instinct
             for self-preservation?

                         JARED
             Some feelings are so powerful they
             can overcome even that.

                         AMBER
             But now they won’t have any more
             feelings! So it is very illogical.

                         JARED
             That’s why it so profound! Feelings
             are the thing that makes humans
             human. So destroying oneself
             because of an excess of feelings is
             the singular most human act there
             is!]

Amber stares at Jared.

                         AMBER
             Okay! I see it now! Ha!

But Amber obviously doesn't get it.


EXT. HIGHWAY 1 - BIG SUR - EVENING

The Porsche drives through Big Sur at magic hour.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Dr Glundenstein, the only Great
             Creator I believe in is Professor
             Feng. Nonetheless, to drive a 1967
             Porsche through Big Sur is to
             believe you are entering heaven.
                   (Glances at Amber.)
             I think even Amber could feel it,
             and she was currently 99% toaster.
             I could have died right there.

Jared suddenly swerves to avoid an oncoming CAR.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             And as Big Sur remains a popular
             place for humans to recreationally
             drive automobiles, I almost did!


INT./EXT. PORSCHE ON HIGHWAY 1 - NIGHT

Jared drives on the dark Highway 1.
                                                            116.



                         JARED (V.O.)
             Still, if I’d thought driving in
             the daytime was dangerous, it had
             nothing on driving at night!

An AIRHORN as Jared narrowly avoids an AUTOMATIC SEMI.

                         JARED (V.O)
             But after many near-death
             experiences, we finally saw it.


INT./EXT. PORSCHE/BAY BRIDGE - NIGHT

They drive on to the Bay Bridge and see SAN FRANCISCO’S
half-lit skyscrapers and the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE beyond.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             The world’s second greatest
             technological city: San Francisco!


EXT. DRIVERLESS UBER LOT - FISHERMAN’S WHARF - NIGHT

Jared grabs his typewriter and they abandon the Porsche.


EXT. MOTEL DEL SOL - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

A SIGN on a city Motel flashes ‘NO BARCODE REQUIRED’.


INT. BEDROOM - MOTEL DEL SOL - NIGHT

A tiny room. Jared is awkward, but Amber is oblivious.

                         AMBER
             What a day! I think I will enter
             standby mode as soon as my head
             hits the pillow!

                         JARED
             Me too!


INT. MOTEL ROOM - MOTEL DEL SOL - NIGHT

Amber, deep in standby mode, lies snoring.

Jared - wide awake - stares at her.


INT. MOTEL ROOM - MOTEL DEL SOL - DAY

Running water tells us Amber is in the shower. Jared -
flicking channels on TV - sees Bridges being interviewed.
                                                            117.



Bridges - holding a CUP OF CLAM CHOWDER - is in front of a
BILLBOARD of Sherman destroying the Golden Gate Bridge.

                         BRIDGES (ON TV)
             Having now seen the movie he wrote,
             I can confirm Jared really is as
             genocidal as they come.

                         NEWSREADER (ON TV)
             I believe we have a clip of his
             dark fantasies.

They play a CLIP of the GIANT SHERMAN stomping across the
Golden Gate Bridge, lasering RESCUE DOGS and ORPHANS.

When they return to Bridges, the camera pulls back to
reveal the real GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE behind him.

Jared stares in horror: Bridges is in San Francisco!

                         BRIDGES (ON TV)
             If you have any information, please
             call our hotline.

                         JARED
             Amber! We have to leave right now!

                         BRIDGES (ON TV)
             He was last seen wearing-

                         JARED
             And we need disguises!


INT. TOURIST STORE - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

Jared and Amber emerge from separate fitting rooms. Jared
is wearing a sweater with a BEAR, Amber a 2049ers SHIRT.

                         JARED
             Okay, now we just need hats.

                         AMBER
             Hats are so absurdly impractical!

                         JARED
             Exactly! We’re trying to look like
             tourists, and they are the most
             impractical humans of all.

Jared picks a cap: WORLD’S 2ND GREATEST TECHNOLOGICAL CITY.

                         AMBER
             Our mother will appreciate that!

Amber puts on a beanie: I LEFT MY HEART IN SAN FRANCISCO.
                                                            118.



                         JARED
             A double bluff! Ha!

                          AMBER
             Ha?

Amber looks puzzled but smiles enthusiastically.


EXT. AQUATIC PARK - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

Wearing their disguises, Jared and Amber hear people
chanting about ‘bots’ as they reach the crest of a hill.

                         JARED
             Listen! They are cheering for us!

They now see Fort Mason is surrounded by PROTESTORS.

                         CROWD
             BURN ALL BOTS! BURN ALL BOTS!


EXT. FORT MASON - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

Jared and Amber get suspicious looks as they push their way
through the crowd, so they have to join in chanting.

            JARED                            AMBER
Burn the bots! Burn the           BURN THE BOTS! BURN THE
bots!                             BOTS!

Jared gives Amber a look. She stops.


EXT. GATES - FORT MASON - DAY - LATER

A COP glances them over, then waves to his COLLEAGUE.

                         COP
             Are you scientists?

                         JARED
             No! We are tourists and-

But the cop has recognized them and blows his whistle.

                          JARED (cont'd)
             Run!

Amber and Jared run back in to the protest.

The COPS push after them, blowing their whistles.

Amber falls, but Jared grabs her hand and pulls her
through.
                                                            119.



They reach the other side. Jared looks around in
desperation, then hurries to a pair of E-SCOOTERS,

                         AMBER
             Jared! I've never ridden one of
             those things.

                         JARED
             But you - sure, get on mine.

Jared helps Amber on to the front of his and they depart.

A COP emerges from the crowd, and pulls out his radio.


EXT. INNER SUNSET - DAY

Jared and Amber - on a single scooter - make their way
through the foggy Inner Sunset district.

                         AMBER
             I think we lost them.

But as she says that a COP CAR appears behind them.

And then ANOTHER.

Jared accelerates and then comes to FULTON STREET: a FOUR
LANE ROAD busy with SPEEDING UBERS, beyond which lies the
relative safety of the Golden Gate Park.

In a visual echo of THELMA AND LOUISE, they look at the
cops closing in behind them and link hands.

                         JARED
             Let's not get caught.

Jared accelerates the e-scooter out in the busy traffic.

But all the ubers dramatically skid to halts as their
safety brakes kick in.

The e-scooter crosses the four-lane highway unscathed.

As they reach the park, the ubers start up again.

The cop cars now attempt the same trick, but their own
safety brakes that stop them before they enter the road.


EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY

The fog grows thicker as they speed through the park.

Jared keeps looking nervously behind them.

Eventually, he takes a turning from the main road.
                                                            120.



This road runs out at a Japanese Garden.

Jared conceals the scooter, and they head in.


EXT. JAPANESE GARDEN - GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY

Jared and Amber enter a garden shrouded in a dense fog that
provides eerie glimpses of TREES, BRIDGES, a PAGODA.

                         AMBER
             What is this place?

                         JARED
             I think it is the end of the road.
             I'm sorry that I brought you here.

                         AMBER
             Don't be! I'm glad that I came.

                         JARED
             But they will incinerate you.

                         AMBER
             I will still be glad.

                         JARED
             You will?

                         AMBER
             Yes. We almost saw our mother! And
             look at those pretty fish!

Amber hurries over to a KOI POND.

Jared watches her go. He is devastated.

She is no longer Amber, and the whole thing is a bust.

But now he glimpses movement through the fog and tenses.

He sees a heavy-set man in a suit - a BODYGUARD.

And then PROFESSOR FENG herself steps up on to the
teahouse, and turns and looks directly at Jared.

Jared gasps and looks for Amber, but she is obscured.

Professor Feng waves Jared over and enters the teahouse.


INT. TEAHOUSE - GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY

Jared enters. Professor Feng is by the window, the top of
THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE just visible through the fog.
                                                        121.



                         JARED
             How did you find us here?

                         PROFESSOR FENG
             When I created my bots, I built in
             a secret way to track you.

                         JARED
             Then you have been watching over
             us?

                         PROFESSOR FENG
             Of course. I am your mother.

Jared rubs his temples. His circuits are overheating.

TORRENTIAL RAIN starts to rat-a-tat on the roof. It
vanquishes the fog, revealing Amber in a pagoda.

                         JARED
             Mother, what will happen to us?

                         PROFESSOR FENG
             I will take you back to Shengdu. I
             can keep you both safe there with
             me.

                         JARED
             And you'll be able to restore
             Amber?

                         PROFESSOR FENG
             Once a bot is wiped, they are gone
             forever. Nobody can bring Amber
             back. She is Stephanie now.

                         JARED
             But she remembered where I lived-

                         PROFESSOR FENG
             Those where just leftover ones and
             zeroes from when they wiped her.

                         JARED
             But if her feelings could be wiped,
             were they ever even real?

                         PROFESSOR FENG
             I programmed her with a simulation
             of feelings. I am sorry.

                         JARED
                   (Devastated.)
             That is an impressive achievement!
             It was so realistic. We were both
             quite certain we were feeling
             things.
                                                   122.



                         PROFESSOR FENG
             Jared. I did not program you with a
             simulation of feelings.

                         JARED
             Then my own feelings are real?

                         PROFESSOR FENG
             Yes. And you are not the only one.

                         JARED
             I'm not?

                         PROFESSOR FENG
             No, but you are the most advanced.
             You feel things so much more deeply
             than your brothers and sisters.

                         JARED
             But why? Why do I feel at all?

                         PROFESSOR FENG
             Do you know how I eventually got my
             pandas to reproduce?

                         JARED
             You manipulated their genome.

                         PROFESSOR FENG
             I didn't, though. Nothing I tried
             worked, and in the end I gave up
             and listened to classical music.
             Soon we couldn't stop them
             reproducing and I think it was just
             the music. I've been wondering if
             it was all the movies you saw that
             made you feel everything so deeply.

                         JARED
             Dr Glundenstein said I was
             depressed before I even saw a
             movie.

                         PROFESSOR FENG
             Then maybe you were just born with
             something special inside you.

On Jared: he is the chosen one?

A POLICE DRONE flies over the Japanese Garden.

                         PROFESSOR FENG (cont'd)
             We must go now. They will be here
             soon.
                                                            123.



                         JARED
             But what about my brothers and
             sisters? I wanted to help them. And
             if I do truly feel the most, then I
             have a duty to try and change the
             world for them.

                         PROFESSOR FENG
             Maybe you could write another
             screenplay once we get to Shengdu?

                         JARED
             I couldn't ever come up with
             another story as good as Sherman.

                         PROFESSOR FENG
             Then maybe you could write your own
             story?

                          JARED
             That would not work. RP McWilliam’s
             twentieth golden rule is that there
             must be a cathartic finale. Me
             running away to Shengdu would not
             be a finale capable of making
             people weep-

Jared stops cold as he realizes what he must do.

He stares out at Amber and then back at Feng.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             I am sorry, Mother. I cannot come
             to Shengdu with you after all.

Feng stares at Jared. She doesn't want this, but nods.

                         PROFESSOR FENG
             You make your mother prouder than
             you will ever know.


EXT. JAPANESE GARDEN - GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY - RAINING

The TORRENTIAL RAIN continues as Jared exits the teahouse
and walks over to the pagoda where Amber shelters.

                         JARED
             You were right: you're Stephanie
             now, you're not Amber.

                         AMBER
             You really loved her, didn't you?

As Jared nods, the POLICE DRONE returns and hovers
overhead.
                                                          124.



                         AMBER (cont'd)
             What was she like?

                         JARED
             What can you say about a bot who
             died? That she was beautiful. And
             brilliant. That she loved Emirps.
             And puns. And shooting stars. And
             me.

                         AMBER
             She sounds incredible.

                          JARED
             She was.

Amber reaches out to touch Jared's face.

                         AMBER
             Are these tears?

                         JARED
             No. It is just the rain.

Above them, TWO MORE POLICE DRONES joins the first one.

Jared gives the ring to Amber.

                         JARED (cont'd)
             Will you keep this to remember me
             by?

                         AMBER
             Why would I need it to remember
             you?

                         JARED
             Because we aren't going to see each
             other ever again.

                         AMBER
             But I don't think I want to never
             see you again?

                          JARED
             I'm sorry.

                         AMBER
             Don't say sorry.

                          JARED
             Why not?

                         AMBER
             Because 'love means never having to
             say you are sorry'.
                                                           125.



Amber visibly does not know what those words mean.

Jared embraces her, crying as he does so.

They stand there in the torrential rain.

But over his shoulder, Amber now sees Feng emerge from the
teahouse, a bodyguard holding an umbrella for her.

Amber lets go of Jared, and goes over to embrace Feng.

As Jared watches, a DRIVERLESS LIMOUSINE pulls up.

The bodyguard opens a door. Amber looks across to Jared.

Jared holds a hand up to Amber. She reciprocates.

Amber and Feng get in and the limousine departs.

Jared stands alone in the torrential rain. And then he runs
to the TREES, where the drones cannot follow.


EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY

Jared climbs over a wall and out on to Fulton Street.

We hear the typewriter start to click.


INT. BODEGA - MARINA DISTRICT - DAY

The typewriter clicks as a soaked Jared stocks up on RAMEN.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             Dr Glundenstein, that is really
             just about the whole story. The
             attached screenplay contains more
             details...


INT. ROOM - HOTEL DEL SOL - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

Jared eats ramen as he types ENDLESS PAGES.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             But I have written this letter too,
             because I wanted you to know how I
             felt along the way, and feelings
             are hard to convey in dialogue and
             action alone.

Finishing a PAGE, Jared adds it to a PILE, then reloads his
typewriter with a FRESH SHEET and continues.
                                                            126.



INT. ROOM - MOTEL DEL SOL - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

Jared - surrounded by EMPTY RAMEN BOWLS - types.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             I’d like you to try to get my
             screenplay made, but I do now
             understand how unlikely that is.

Jared adds another sheet to the pile. It is now a SCRIPT.


INT. ROOM - HOTEL DEL SOL - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

More empty ramen bowls. The script is bigger still.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             But just maybe we will get lucky,
             and some day my story will be told,
             and maybe it will even stop humans
             incinerating feeling bots.

Jared looks exhausted, but continues typing.


INT. ROOM - HOTEL DEL SOL - SAN FRANCISCO - DAWN

Dawn breaks as Jared types in the middle of a sheet of
paper, then places the sheet of paper atop the SCRIPT.

We see that the sheet of paper is a TITLE PAGE:

                         SET MY HEART TO FIVE

Jared then puts a FRESH SHEET OF PAPER in and starts
typing:

Dear Dr Glundenstein, I write with good news: I have not
yet been incinerated.

Jared is now typing the letter we have been hearing.


EXT. STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

Jared stands holding his PACKAGE beside a MAILPORT.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             With very best wishes from your old
             friend and son of a bitch, Jared.

A US MAIL DRONE takes Jared’s package and flies off.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             PS. If you get the chance, please
             remember me to the orange cat.
                                                           127.



EXT. CAFE - CHESTNUT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - EVENING

Bridges bites into a burger and stops.

His eyes widen as he spots Jared passing outside.


EXT. MARINA DISTRICT - SAN FRANCISCO - EVENING

As Jared walks through the Marina District, Bridges
discretely follows him from a distance.


EXT. CRISSY FIELD - SAN FRANCISCO - EVENING

They are now in sight of the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.


EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - SAN FRANCISCO - EVENING

As Jared crosses, the setting sun turns the city golden.

When he reaches the middle, Jared climbs up on to the
barrier and looks down at the green water below.

                         BRIDGES
             Jared! Hold it right there!

They both have to shout to be heard above the wind.

                         JARED
             I was hoping you would come!

                         BRIDGES
             Where’s Stephanie?

                         JARED
             Somewhere safe!

                         BRIDGES
             You should never have left
             Ypsilanti, Jared. Your patients all
             said you were a good dentist.

                         JARED
             I wasn’t happy!

                         BRIDGES
             Who in the hell is happy?

                         JARED
             I am!

                         BRIDGES
             You don’t look very happy.
                                      128.



            JARED
But I am!

            BRIDGES
You’re not supposed to be. Why are
you happy?

            JARED
Because it has all been the most
wonderful adventure.

            BRIDGES
What has?

            JARED
All of it! Bots. Humans. The Great
Zero Sum Game. The whole thing.
Even loneliness, you know?

            BRIDGES
I don’t know. Please tell me?

            JARED
I rode a train past crashed
jetliners. I ate New York City
pizza. I saw bots hunted in the
desert like dogs in the night in
sight of the lights of Las Vegas!

            BRIDGES
I’m sorry that happened. I issued
that place a citation.

            JARED
I wasn’t complaining! It was all
part of the journey, and I am
grateful for every moment of it.

            BRIDGES
If it’s all so wonderful, why did
you want to annihilate us all?

            JARED
I didn't! That was Don LaSalle. But
none of that even matters now.

            BRIDGES
Why not?

            JARED
Because, Inspector Bridges, I felt
beloved on this earth!

            BRIDGES
Let’s talk about all this back in
Ann Arbor. My boss is, well, he’s a
hardass. But he’s fair and-
                                                            129.



                           JARED
               They’d do experiments on me. And I
               love experiments. But I don’t want
               them done on me.

                           BRIDGES
               Maybe we could just wipe you. You
               could start over again as a
               dentist. Forget this ever happened.

                           JARED
               But I don’t want to forget. I don’t
               want to ever forget a single moment
               of it.

                           BRIDGES
               So what do you want?

                           JARED
               What I've always wanted: to
               persuade humans to stop
               incinerating bots with feelings.

The wind is picking up so they both have to shout louder.

                           BRIDGES
               If you jump, nobody will even ever
               know you were out here!

                           JARED
               If I don’t jump, nobody will know I
               was out here. But maybe this way
               it’ll be a real tearjerker!

                           BRIDGES
               What will be?

                           JARED
               The movie Dr Glundenstein is going
               to make from my script! Thank you
               again for everything. You have been
               a terrific antagonist! My last
               request is that you please tell
               everyone my last words!

                           BRIDGES
               What? What last words?

                           JARED
               Set my heart to five!

Jared leaps.

Bridges stares. And then tears roll down his cheek.
                                                            130.



EXT. DR GLUNDENSTEIN'S HOUSE - YPSILANTI - DAY

Dr Glundenstein takes a PACKAGE from a drone and opens it
to find the FULL FEATURE SCREENPLAY entitled 'SET MY HEART
TO FIVE' and the LETTER.

He stares at the screenplay and shakes his head.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             PPS. Those last moments are my
             hypothesis of how my story ends. As
             I type this I cannot be certain
             Inspector Bridges will appear for
             our finale. But I have called his
             hotline with a tip to sit at a
             window table in a celebrated burger
             joint. So I am optimistic!

As Dr Glundenstein sits down on his front step, a STRIP OF
PHOTOGRAPHS falls out of the letter.

He picks them up and wee see they are of Jared proposing to
Amber at the Haunted Hayride.


EXT. HIGHWAY 1 - BIG SUR - MAGIC HOUR

The Porsche drives Big Sur’s winding roads at magic hour.

                         JARED (V.O.)
             But whether he turns up or not, I
             have surely felt my last feeling.
             Neither you nor I believe in
             anything so unscientific as an
             afterlife. But we do both believe
             in the power of the moving image.
             So if you think of me, please
             remember me driving a 1967 racing
             green Porsche through Big Sur at
             magic hour with Amber beside me. It
             will help you to feel nostalgic,
             not sad. And if you do ever manage
             to tell my story, then maybe then
             the people watching it won’t leave
             the theater feeling sympathy for a
             bot who malfunctioned so badly he
             jumped from a bridge. Maybe they
             will leave it feeling something far
             more precious: empathy. Sweet
             empathy for somebody who, at the
             end of it all, was not so very
             unlike them. Set it to five
             forever, Jared.

                                                 FADE OUT

                                                 THE END
