OVER BLACK:

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          I've been writing about TV shows
          for so long, sometimes I feel like
          I'm in one.


INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL - SUITE — FEB 2014

The screen explodes with the flickering lights of BIRTHDAY
CANDLES on a CAKE.

CLOSE ON: MIKE, 40, with a sweet, open face. He makes a wish
and then, with determination, takes a deep breath...


INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL - SUITE — LATER

A dozen and a half BIRTHDAY PARTY GUESTS are gathered in a
large and swanky suite cheering Mike as the candles go out.
Mike looks up at KIT, 42, tall and handsome, with a
contagious and mischievous smile.


INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL — SUITE — LATER

A KNIFE slices through the large sheet cake decorated with a
fondant PAPA SMURF and “HAPPY 40th MIKE!”

                    MIKE
          No one’s getting a slice of Papa
          Smurf. I will be cutting around
          Papa, not through him.

                    KIT
          Mike, he takes up half the cake.

Mike hands a piece of cake to NICK, 40s, who waves it off.

                    NICK
          I just came for slots.

                    MIKE
          Says the biggest slot I know.

                    NICK
          Slot-shaming is never okay.
                                                         2.


INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL — SUITE — LATER

Mike struggles to open a bottle of CHAMPAGNE, as Kit talks to
NINA, 41, Nick and RILEY, 22, Nick's attractive young twink
boyfriend. Kit takes the bottle from Mike and opens it.


INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL — SUITE — LATER

Nick and Riley are with Mike, who’s sipping a glass of WINE.
Nick hands him a beautifully wrapped GIFT.

                    MIKE
              (dryly)
          I said no gifts unless they're
          super expensive and come with a
          gift receipt.

                    NICK
          Shut up and open it.

Mike rips the wrapper open to reveal a VINTAGE TV GUIDE with
DOM DELUISE smiling on the cover.

                    NICK (CONT'D)
          It’s from the week you were born,
          Mr. TVLine.

                    MIKE
          Holy hell. Dom DeLuise in “Lotsa
          Luck.” Ran only one season.

                    NICK
          The shit you know.

                    RILEY (O.C.)
          Wait, is that you?

Riley's been looking at a PHOTO of Mike, one of many
displayed on a nearby table. It’s YOUNG MIKE, 12, when he was
OBESE.

                    MIKE
          That was me.

                    NICK
          You look like a young Dom DeLuise.

                    MIKE
          I'll take that as a compliment.
                                                           3.


INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL — SUITE — LATER

Mike getting everyone’s attention, holding up a wine glass...

                    MIKE
          Attention please! Thank you all for
          coming to the edge of the earth to
          celebrate with me. You’ll be happy
          to hear, Nick, that it’s time to go
          play sluts. And because my
          generosity knows no bounds, I’m
          spotting everyone their first five
          bucks.

                    NINA
          We don't deserve you.

As Mike starts handing out five dollar bills, he looks around
the room for Kit, who’s nowhere to be seen.


INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL — SUITE - BATHROOM — LATER

Kit, looking tired, sits on the edge of the tub, as Mike
comes in.

                    MIKE
          There you are. We’re going down to
          the casino.
              (taking him in)
          You all right?

                      KIT
          I'm fine.

                      MIKE
          You sure?

                    KIT
          I'm fine. You enjoying your party?

                    MIKE
          I am. Thank you for... this.


INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL — CASINO — LATER

Mike plays SLOTS next to Nick and Riley as Kit and Nina walk
up. Nick immediately notices ten gaudy SPIDER RINGS on each
of Kit's fingers.

                    NICK
          Where’d you get those?
                                                         4.


                    KIT
          I won them in the arcade. You like?

                    MIKE
              (looking up for a second)
          They’re very you.

                    KIT
          I’m saving them for Halloween. I’m
          going as Sharon Needles from Drag
          Race.

Mike turns his attention back to the slot machine...

                    MIKE
              (to himself)
          Come on, Universe. I need a win.

Mike pushes the spin button and the screen starts to twirl,
Kit comes closer to him.

                    KIT
          I’m gonna run upstairs to go to the
          bathroom.

Mike watches him walk away, looking concerned. He's thinking
about following him when he suddenly hears DING, DING, DING.

His slot machine is erupting with noise. THREE DOUBLE
DIAMONDS have lined up in a row. The simulated sound of coins
crashing into the payout tray fills the air...

CONFETTI starts falling from the ceiling now, then balloons.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          That really happened. Me winning,
          at least. Not the balloons and the
          confetti. That was me. I watch too
          much TV.

Mike proudly turns back to see if Kit caught this before he
went upstairs. He didn't. He's gone. A heaviness once again
begins to permeate Mike's face.

                     MIKE (V.O.)
          I tried so hard to put on a happy
          face that night.
              (beat)
          Now hold that cryptic thought while
          we segue to what we in the TV biz
          call an "extended flashback
          sequence" because, um, origin
          story. Duh.
                                                           5.


The ding, ding, ding of the slot machine gets louder and
louder, turning into a THUMP, THUMP, THUMP...

CHYRON: PREVIOUSLY ON


INT. CLUB - NIGHT - NOV 2001

A New York City nightclub, packed with GAY MEN in various
athletic gear. Mike, 27 now, stands awkwardly on the edge of
the dance floor with Nick, 30, who's in baseball pants and a
tank-top, and ADAM, 22, in just a tight wrestling singlet, an
earlier twink boyfriend. Mike's only nod to sports is his
Yankee cap.

                    MIKE
          I don't belong here.

                    NICK
          It's the Athletes Ball. You jog.

                    MIKE
          I run. I don't jog.

Two HOT GUYS with perfect abs, wearing nothing but football
pants and black stripes under their eyes, push past them.
They shout over the music...

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          I’m going to go do some crunches.
          Be back in six months.

                    NICK
          If you leave, Mike, Osama Bin Laden
          wins.

Mike looks around at the throng, as   if on cue, a SWIRLING
SPOTLIGHT hits Kit, 29 now, looking   younger and more handsome
than ever. He’s standing with Nina,   28, just like he was at
Atlantic City. She’s one of the few   women there.

Mike can’t help but stare at him, he’s so striking. Suddenly
Kit turns away from Nina and his eyes land on Mike’s. Mike
freaks and quickly turns away. Nick saw everything and
smiles.

                     NICK (CONT'D)
          You're welcome.
              (beat)
          Hey, Adam, baby, go get us some
          drinks--two vodka sodas and...?
                                                          6.


                    MIKE
          Diet Coke for me.
              (off Adam heading off)
          Is he old enough to buy drinks?

                    NICK
          He’s twenty-two! And an actor!

                    MIKE
          I knew he looked familiar-- I’ve
          seen his work on Nickelodeon.

Mike's trying not to, but he can’t help sneak another look at
Kit, who catches him and their eyes meet. Kit smiles. Mike
quickly spins around to find Nick looking at him.

                    NICK
          He's totally into you.

                    MIKE
          No, he's not.

                    NICK
          He is.
              (looking over at Kit)
          He's checking you out. Right now.
          Turn around.

                    MIKE
          No. I can’t.

Nick takes Mike by the shoulders and gently, but firmly
turns him around.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          It was like looking into the sun.
          If the sun was tall, with a slim
          build, an aquiline nose and wearing
          the perfect pair of nerdy-but-sexy
          glasses.

                    NICK
          Ask him to dance!

Mike turns around to look at Nick again...

                    MIKE
          He’s with a woman!

                    NICK
          Don’t be ridiculous. No man in this
          room has been “with a woman” for
          years. If ever.
                                                         7.


Kit begins to walk over as Mike starts to panic.

                    MIKE
          He's coming over.

                    NICK
          I'm going to go see what's taking
          Adam so long.

                    MIKE
          Please don't leave me.

Nick ignores him, walking away as Kit arrives.

             KIT                         MIKE (CONT'D)
Hey!                              Hey!

                    KIT
          Buy you a drink?

                    MIKE
          A child actor is fetching me one.
          But thank you.

                      KIT
          It’s Kit!

                    MIKE
          Kit? Really? I'm Mike! That's
          crazy! Mike and Kit! Knight Rider!

Kit is slow to make the connection.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          It was a TV show in the Eighties.

                    KIT
          Do you want to dance?

                    MIKE
          I'm not much of a dancer...

                    KIT
              (interrupts)
          Come on.

Off Mike, nervously smiling...


INT. CLUB - NIGHT - LATER

Mike awkwardly dances with Kit in a crowd of shirtless MEN.
Kit’s shirtless too, a red cocktail STRAW between his teeth.
                                                         8.


He’s adorable, like a flirty farm boy with a piece of hay in
the corner of his mouth.

Kit leans in to kiss him, but Mike playfully blocks him by
plucking the straw out of Kit’s mouth and putting it in his
own. Kit takes the bait, leans in closer and pulls the straw
back with his teeth, very nearly kissing Mike in the process.

Kit takes the straw and flicks it into the crowd. Mike can’t
help but smile, and it’s then and there that Kit pulls him in
close and they have their first kiss.

As they make out, the room starts to spin, the crowd
disappears, leaving them alone on the dance floor.

When they break out of the kiss they’re suddenly surrounded
by the crowd again as confetti and balloons fall from the
ceiling, Kit looks up.

                    KIT
          Is this really happening?

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          This time it really was.

Mike looks up, feeling a little, well, overwhelmed.


INT. GREENWICH VILLAGE RESTAURANT - NIGHT - NOV 2001

Mike, dressed for a date, sits across from Kit.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Less than fifteen minutes into our
          first date, I found out the tall
          drink of water sitting across from
          me, by the name of Kit Cowan,
          watched zero television.

                    MIKE
          No TV at all?

                    KIT
          Is that a problem?

                    MIKE
          No. No, of course not.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          It was a huge problem.

                    KIT
          Favorite show?
                                                9.


                    MIKE
          At the moment? Felicity.

                    KIT
          Is that the one that got cancelled
          because the star cut her hair?

                    MIKE
              (eye roll)
          It did not get cancelled. But yes,
          there was an uproar over her
          haircut.

                    KIT
          See, I know stuff!

The WAITER arrives with their drinks...

                    WAITER
          A Stella, and a Diet Coke for you.

                    KIT
          So, don’t drink or can’t?

                    MIKE
          Am I an alcoholic? No. I just never
          liked the taste. What about you:
          drunkard or junkie?

                    KIT
          Photographer slash art director.

                    MIKE
          Both then. Hm.

                    KIT
          What do you do?

                    MIKE
          I’m a journalist. I write about
          television.

                     KIT
          Ah... that makes sense. For a
          newspaper?

                    MIKE
          Magazine. TV Guide.

Kit is impressed.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          I'm actually flying to LA tomorrow
          to visit the Felicity set.
                                                10.


Kit is even more impressed.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          What do you photograph about?
          Fashion stuff?

                       KIT
          Sometimes.

                    MIKE
          Is it rough being around underwear
          models?

                    KIT
          You get used to it.

There’s a slightly awkward pause.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          There is one show I like: Ab Fab.
          I have the entire series on DVD.

                    MIKE
          Figures. The one show I’ve never
          seen is the only show you’ve ever
          watched.

                    KIT
          You’ve never seen AbFab? And you
          call yourself a--

                    MIKE
          I’m a bad gay, I know.

                    KIT
          I was going to say a bad television
          journalist.

Mike's enjoying the ribbing.

                    MIKE
          How about a speed round?

                    KIT
          A speed round?

                    MIKE
          Middle child. Two brothers.

                    KIT
              (catching on)
          Only child.
                                      11.


          MIKE
Suburban New Jersey.

          KIT
Rural Pennsylvania.

          MIKE
Mama’s boy.

             KIT
Lost boy.

             MIKE
Catholic.

             KIT
Nothing.

             MIKE
Lucky you!

          KIT
Childhood obsession: Magic.

          MIKE
Daytime soaps. And... other stuff.
Worst Christmas memory: Finding a
train set under the tree.

          KIT
Not finding a magic set under mine.

             MIKE
Why not?

           KIT
My mom's pretty no-nonsense and she
thought magic was all nonsense.
Adult obsession: mid-century
furniture.

          MIKE
Small-town gift shops, preferably
ones untouched by time.

          KIT
You would've loved the five-and-
dime in my hometown. It's not there
anymore, sadly.

          MIKE
That's my retirement plan, running
a little gift store on Main Street,
USA.
                                                        12.


They smile. There’s another pause, but this one isn’t
awkward. Kit holds Mike’s glance.

                    KIT
          So what are your parents like?

                    MIKE
          My mom died when I was a teenager.

                      KIT
          Oh--

                    MIKE
          It gets worse. My dad died a few
          years later.

Kit takes him in...

                     KIT
          I'm sorry.
              (beat)
          Want to come over and watch a
          little AbFab after dinner?

Off Mike, surprised by that...

                    MIKE
          Do I look like the type of guy who
          goes back to someone's apartment on
          the first date?

Kit just smiles as we SMASH CUT...


INT. KIT'S STUDIO APT

Kit’s apartment is neat and stylish. Mike scans the room for
clues. There are KITSCHY KNICKKNACKS on the windowsill, a
wall covered with Kit’s PHOTOS, and a large drafting table
with half-finished works of art. Kit suddenly pulls Mike in
for a kiss. He begins to steer him toward the bed, pulling
Mike’s shirt up.

                     MIKE
               (tucking shirt back in)
          Can I use the bathroom? I have to
          pee.
                                                        13.


INT. KIT STUDIO APT - BATHROOM – MOMENTS LATER

Mike looks at himself in the mirror, lifts his shirt up,
staring at his stretch marks, a reminder of when he was a fat
and lonely kid. Suddenly looking very distressed, he pulls
his shirt down, and tucks it in.

He decides to open the medicine cabinet and finds a single
toothbrush -- a good sign -- and a small ceramic figurine of
two DINOSAURS FUCKING.

Mike closes the medicine cabinet, then spots what looks like
a measuring stick on top of the toilet tank.

When he picks it up it becomes clear it’s actually a “PETER
METER” with measurements reading “Should Have Been A Girl,”
“Water Spout,” “For Big Girls And Small Cattle." Mike looks
more than a little rattled, as he carefully sets it down...
then washes his hands.


INT. KIT'S STUDIO APT - MOMENTS LATER

Mike comes out of the bathroom...

                    MIKE
          Is it okay if we just watch TV?

                     KIT
          Of course.
              (grabs a DVD off the
               shelf)
          AbFab's OK?

                    MIKE
          Better late than never.

As Kit pops in the disc.


INT. KIT STUDIO APT — LATER

The episode's just ending and Kit turns off the TV. They're
next to each other in the bed. Mike's still looking nervous.

                    KIT
          I think that was the gayest thing
          I’ve ever done on a first date.

                    MIKE
          I doubt that.

Kit leans in and kisses Mike...
                                      14.


          MIKE (CONT'D)
How about a gay speed round?

          KIT
So we’re going to do every gay
thing but the actual gay thing?

          MIKE
Realized at twelve.

          KIT
Fourteen. Late bloomer.

          MIKE
Obvious and bullied.

            KIT
I passed.

          MIKE
Came out in college.

          KIT
Same. Mostly. Sort of.

          MIKE
You mostly, sort of, came out in
college?

          KIT
I came out to everyone but my
parents.

          MIKE
When did you tell them?
    (off his busted look)
Oh my god! How do your parents not
know? You’re a photographer. You're
into Ab-Fab. Can’t they do the
math?

          KIT
They’re bad at math.

          MIKE
It’s barely addition.

          KIT
So when did you tell your mom,
Harvey Milk?
                                                        15.


                    MIKE
          I didn't have to. We were both
          watching "Days of Our Lives" and
          she caught me drooling over a
          shirtless Bo Brady.

                    KIT
          Busted.

                    MIKE
          Yeah, it's awkward to realize
          you're gay at the exact same moment
          your mother realizes you're
          realizing you're gay.

Kit laughs, then really takes Mike in, before deciding to
come clean...

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          What?

                    KIT
              (sheepish)
          I’m not a fashion photographer. I
          take pictures of sandwiches and
          make store signage for Cosi... the
          sandwich chain.

                    MIKE
          I love Cosi! I eat there all the
          time. Their bread is delicious.

Kit smiles, leans in gently and kisses him. They begin to
make out. It gets heated fast. Kit pulls his t-shirt off.

Mike gets a good look at his abs as Kit starts to pull Mike’s
shirt up. Mike quickly pulls away...

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          I have to go.

                    KIT
          Stay.

                    MIKE
          I told you, I'm going to LA in the
          morning. I have to pack.

                    KIT
          How long will you be gone?

                    MIKE
          Just overnight.
                                                           16.


                    KIT
          Am I going to see you again?

                    MIKE
          Absolutely...

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          And I kept my word.


INT. KIT STUDIO APT - NIGHT - NOV 2001

CLOSE ON: AbFab on TV, as we pull back to reveal a fully
clothed Mike edging away from a shirtless Kit.

                    KIT
          It's nice to have you back on the
          East Coast, Mr. Hollywood.

                    MIKE
          It was my first time on a
          soundstage. And it was Felicity!

                    KIT
              (barely listening)
          You have great legs.

Kit runs his hands over Mike’s legs. Mike tenses up...

                       MIKE
          I run.

                       KIT
          It shows.

Kit tries to lift Mike’s shirt and Mike blocks him.

                       MIKE
          I’m sorry.

                    KIT
          Look, if you’re not into me...

                    MIKE
          I am. I’m just... a little insecure
          about my tummy.

Kit gets up and turns off the overhead light and the lamp on
the drafting/work table. He picks up the remote, mutes the
TV, and turns the TV around to face the wall.

The soft glow from the ever-changing images on the TV bounce
off the walls and around the room — it’s a simple but magical
effect. Kit lies back down next to Mike.
                                                        17.


                    KIT
          Better?

                    MIKE
          Photographer my ass. You're an
          artist.

                    KIT
          You don’t have to take your shirt
          off. Leaving something on is hot.

Mike crawls on top of him. They lock eyes. Kit slowly runs
his hands over Mike’s chest, then gently down to his tummy. A
twinge of panic seeps into Mike's expression.

                    MIKE
          I was a fat kid...

                     KIT
              (interrupts)
          This okay?
              (off Mike’s nod)
          I like a little tummy. I like your
          tummy. I like you.

They kiss--Kit shirtless, Mike still wearing his shirt--and
it’s perfect.


INT. TRIBECA ART GALLERY - NIGHT - DEC 2001

Mike walks in and scans the room.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Kit's life was a tad more high-brow
          than mine. He was premium cable to
          my broadcast network.

It’s crowded with ARTY NEW YORKERS. Mike looks intimidated.
He's inching back toward the door, when Kit spots him and
waves him over.

Mike works his way through the crowd and joins Kit, who's
standing with Nina. They hug, air kiss...

                    NINA
          So you must be Mike.

                    MIKE
          I didn’t know I was in “must be”
          territory already.
                                                      18.


                    KIT
          You are.
              (to Nina)
          And you already met him, you lush.

                    NINA
          I was really drunk that night.

                    KIT
          Speaking of which. Who wants a
          drink?

             NINA                              MIKE
   (off her wine)              Diet Coke.
I'm good.

As Kit takes off...

                    NINA
          So what’s your life story? Tell me
          everything.

                    MIKE
          Homosexual.

                    NINA
          Fascinating.

                      MIKE
          You?

                      NINA
          German.

                    MIKE
          Impressive. What side of the wall
          were you on?

                    NINA
          The fun side.

                    MIKE
          May I see your papers?

                    NINA
          Are you INTERPOL?

                    MIKE
          Yes, I'm into pole. I told you I'm
          homosexual.
                                                        19.


Nina tries mightily to keep a straight face and continue
their deadpan repartee but she bursts out laughing, which
tickles Mike to no end. Just then, Mike spots Kit by the bar,
talking to a HANDSOME MAN, clearly flirting.


INT. TRIBECA ART GALLERY - LATER

As Mike scrutinizes one of the pieces, Nina and Kit are on
either side of him scrutinizing Mike...

                    KIT
          So?

                    MIKE
              (vamping)
          It echoes some of his earlier work.
          He’s experimenting with brighter
          colors? It’s good.

                    KIT
          It’s baaaad. Should be hung in a
          lobby or flung in a landfill...

                    MIKE
              (interrupts, relieved)
          I don't know what the fuck I'm
          looking at...

                    NINA
          Show your own work sometime,
          chicken shit.

                    KIT
          This is literally making me
          nauseous.

                    NINA
              (to Mike)
          Have you seen his photography... ?

                    KIT
              (interrupts)
          Bup-bup-bup-bup... that's enough
          out of you.

Off Mike's curious expression, we...


INT. TRIBECA ART GALLERY — OFFICES — MOMENTS LATER

Kit leads Mike through the offices...
                                                        20.


                    MIKE
          Are we even allowed to be in here?

                    KIT
          Not really.

                    MIKE
          Who were you talking to at the bar?

                    KIT
          Just a friend.

Kit opens a window and then steps out and onto the roof of
the adjoining building.

                    MIKE
          What are you doing?

                    KIT
          Are you coming or not?

                    MIKE
          What if someone closes the window?

                    KIT
          Then we’ll die out here.

Kit holds out his hand, Mike takes a moment, then takes it.


EXT. ROOFTOP — MOMENTS LATER

Kit leads him out and onto the roof and Mike can see why:
it’s the most beautiful view of Manhattan. They’re looking up
toward the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building.

                       MIKE
          Oh... wow.

Kit pulls his camera out and takes a photo.

                    KIT
              (turning to Mike)
          Don’t move.

Kit snaps a few pics of Mike, then looks back at the city.
Mike stares at Kit, really taking him in. Kit smiles and
screams at the top of his lungs...

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          I love you, New York! I want to
          spend the rest of my life in you!
                                                        21.


                    MIKE
          Still? Even now?

                    KIT
          Yeah, especially now.

                       MIKE
          Me too.

                    KIT
          You have to yell it. So New York
          can hear you.

                    MIKE
              (shouting)
          I love you, New York! Even though I
          live in New Jersey! And I might
          have to move to LA for work
          someday!
              (off Kit's look)
          Maybe. But not now.

Despite how that sounded, Kit wraps his arms around Mike.

                    KIT
          We should go to your place tonight.

                       MIKE
          No.

                       KIT
          Come on...

                    MIKE
              (looking at watch)
          The last bus is in, like, a half an
          hour...

                    KIT
          We can make that. Easy. I want to
          see your place. Come on, it'll be
          fun...

                     MIKE
          Clearly you have never been to Port
          Authority on a Friday night.
              (clocks Kit's resoluteness
                on the matter)
          What are you gonna brush your teeth
          with?

                     KIT
          My finger.
              (beat, studying Mike)
                     (MORE)
                                                           22.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          Unless there's some reason you
          don't want me to see your place...

                    MIKE
              (defensive)
          Don't be ridiculous...
              (laughs, awkwardly)
          Why wouldn't I want you to see my
          place?


INT. MIKE’S NEW JERSEY APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM — LATER

Kit’s slack-jawed, in the middle of the room taking in the
enormous collection of SMURF figurines and memorabilia. He
looks like he could pass out. There is a long moment of
stunned silence. Mike’s starting to grasp how crazy all this
really looks, especially to someone like Kit.

As Kit reaches for a figurine...

                    MIKE
          That’s Brainy. He’s the smart
          one...

Mike notices the color in Kit’s face begin to drain. Kit
places the figurine down and is unsure of what his next move
should be. He enters the bedroom.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          You don’t want to go in there...

                    KIT (O.S.)
          Oh my God, they’re in here, too!

Mike mimes “Fuck" before following him into the bedroom.


INT. MIKE’S BEDROOM — CONTINUOUS

Mike enters and we see that this is where the bulk of the
Smurf collection is. There's no curation. It looks like a
bomb went off at a flea market. Kit takes a seat on the bed.

                    KIT
          I need a minute.

                    MIKE
          Take all the time you need...

                    KIT
              (interrupts, stern)
          Alone.
                                                         23.


                    MIKE
          Yep.

Mike exits the bedroom and closes the door behind him. As he
waits nervously on the other side of the door, he glances
toward the bathroom nearby and clocks his vintage Smurf
shower curtain and bath rug. He shakes his head before
quickly closing the door shut.

Mike returns to the closed bedroom door and places his ear
against it; he hears nothing. And the silence is killing him.

                     MIKE (CONT'D)
              (rambling)
          I started collecting them when I
          was 10. I outgrew them by high
          school, but then after my mom died
          I picked it up again as a way to
          feel close to her. I started going
          to flea markets and toy shows and
          then eBay became a thing and it
          sorta... maybe... got a little out
          of control.
              (beat)
          I swear I’m not a pedophile.

Suddenly, the door opens. Kit looks unwell.

                    KIT
          I'm sorry. I can't do this.

Kit abruptly exits the apartment, leaving Mike in a state of
utter shock.


INT. MIKE'S NEW JERSEY APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM — LATER

Mike is sitting on his couch watching an episode of Felicity
while crying. Slowly the camera pulls back and we see that
Keri Russell is sitting on the couch next to him, loosely in
character as Felicity. She digs a spoon into a large
container of ice cream and then hands the tub to Michael, who
digs into it with his own spoon.

A sudden knock at the door startles Mike — who is now alone
on the couch. He springs up, dries his eyes with the sleeves
of his shirt and opens the door. Kit is standing there.

                    KIT
          Did you know the greasy spoon up
          the street gives you free pancakes
          with any omelette?
                                                        24.


Kit walks into the apartment past a bewildered Mike and heads
back into the bedroom. Mike follows him, tentatively.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          I fooled around with another guy.

                    MIKE
              (jolted)
          At the Bloomfield Diner... ?

                    KIT
          It happened in the steam room of my
          gym last week. There wasn’t any
          actual sex, but there was touching.
          I know we never had the “exclusive”
          conversation, but I still feel like
          shit for not immediately saying
          something about it...

                    MIKE
          You... cheated on me.

                    KIT
          OK, that’s a bit extreme.

                    MIKE
          Why are you telling me this now?

                    KIT
          We’re coming clean about secrets,
          so...

                    MIKE
          I own a few Smurfs. You cheated.

                    KIT
          A few Smurfs?!

Kit clocks the fear now present in Mike’s eyes.

                     KIT (CONT'D)
          It was just a hand job...
              (beat)
          This is... new for me.

                     MIKE
          What is?

                     KIT
          This. You. Us. It’s different.
              (beat)
          I’ve never not wanted to fuck
          something up this much before.
                                                          25.


Mike can see the remorse in Kit’s face. He takes a deep
breath as he carefully considers his next words.

                    MIKE
          I’m not an open relationship kind
          of guy, so if that’s what you’re
          looking for...

                    KIT
          I didn’t say that...

                    MIKE
          I’m also not as... experienced as
          you.

                    KIT
          I’m not that experienced...

                    MIKE
              (interrupts)
          Let me finish.

                    KIT
          Yep.

                     MIKE
          The first time I saw you, the way
          you carried yourself. The way you
          looked. Your confidence. Your
          inhibition. It scared me.
              (beat)
          Don’t get me wrong, it turned me
          on, too. But I instinctively
          thought, “This is the kinda guy
          that could have anyone he wants.”
              (beat)
          I also thought this is the kinda
          guy who has no trouble taking his
          shirt off at the beach... “

Kit begins to piece together why the steam room encounter was
so triggering for Mike.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          I’m not like that.

                    KIT
          And I’m OK with that.
              (extended beat; Kit grabs
               Mike’s hand)
          Really.

Mike takes in Kit's calm reassurance.
                                                        26.


                    MIKE
          So, for the record, you storming
          out was not about the Smurfs?

                    KIT
          Oh, no. It was absolutely about the
          Smurfs. Mike...
              (looks around)
          ...this is fucking lunacy.

Mike laughs awkwardly, still unsure of how serious a problem
the Smurfs are for Kit.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
              (dead serious)
          Not joking...

                    MIKE
              (interrupts, nodding)
          Got it.


INT. MIKE’S BEDROOM — THE NEXT MORNING

Mike awakens and immediately reaches for Kit, only to
discover he is not there.

                       MIKE
                 (calls out)
          Kit?

Mike hops out of bed and makes a loop around the apartment;
Kit is gone. Slightly alarmed, he goes to pick up his phone
to check his voicemail when he notices a folded up piece of
paper under a Smurf magnet on the fridge. It reads, “Peaks,
Valleys and Unexpected Turbulence.” He opens it.

                    KIT (V.O.)
          As I watched you sleep this morning
          in a totally not-stalker-ish-way...
          I asked myself where are you going?
          Wondered if our tickets are for the
          same destination. On the same
          flight. Perhaps though, our journey
          is the destination. If I’m scared,
          I’ll know you’re in the seat next
          to me. Holding my hand. Telling me
          we’re going to be OK...


INT. KIT STUDIO APT - NIGHT - DEC 2001

Mike watches as Kit opens his Christmas present.
                                                        27.


                    KIT
          Oh, my god, a magic set! How old is
          this thing?

                    MIKE
          1960s. Not exactly your childhood,
          but...

                    KIT
          Where did you... ?

                    MIKE
              (interrupts)
          Ebay is my friend.

                    KIT
          Of course it is.

Kit carefully lays the Sneaky Pete Magic Set on the bed,
grabs his camera, stands directly over it and takes an aerial
shot of his gift, then looks up at Mike and smiles.

                     KIT (CONT'D)
          I love it. Thank you.
              (beat)
          I got you something, too.

                     MIKE
          Actually, can we talk?
              (then)
          Look, if you want to see other
          people--

                     KIT
          I don’t.

                    MIKE
          Well, you did.

                     KIT
          It won’t happen again.
              (then)
          I don’t want anyone else.

                    MIKE
          Okay... so what you're saying is
          we’re going to be exclusive then?

                     KIT
          Yes.

                    MIKE
          Both of us?
                                                          28.


                      KIT
          Yes.

                    MIKE
          Because if you want more than--

                    KIT
          No. I just want you.

As they stare at each other, Mike can't help but smile.
That's exactly what he needed to hear.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          So, can I give you your gift now?

                      MIKE
          You may.

                    KIT
          Close your eyes.

Kit walks Mike over to the closet and slides the door open.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          Okay. Open your eyes.

Half the closet space has been cleared and Kit has made a
beautiful little tastefully made "MIKE" nameplate that hangs
at eye level.

                    MIKE
          Did you make that?

Kit nods. Mike is moved by the meaning behind the gift. Kit,
meanwhile, grabs the magic wand out of the Sneaky Pete's
Magic Set and playfully demonstrates how a closet works,
grabbing Mike's folded-up clothes on the floor and setting
them on the various shelves.

                    KIT
          You can put your sleep shorts
          here... voila! And you can hang
          your pants on a hanger like this...
          voila! And you can put your wallet
          and keys and various sundries
          here... voila!

                    MIKE
              (mock enlightened)
          Oh, that's where the sundries go. I
          wasn't sure.

                      KIT
          Yep. Yep.
                                                        29.


Mike is throughly entertained and charmed by the impromptu
magic show Kit is putting on. As they kiss...


INT. KIT STUDIO APT - NIGHT — DEC 2001

Close on Mike and Kit’s faces as they make love. Mike’s far
less hesitant now. They are both in the zone...

                    KIT
          Oh, my God! I love you!!!


INT. KIT STUDIO APT - LATER

Mike and Kit lie in bed, flushed and spent, both staring up
at the ceiling. After an awkward silence...

                      KIT
          Too soon?

                    MIKE
          Not to feel. Maybe too soon to say?
          We don’t want to jinx things.

                    KIT
          You know, if you silently say
          “olive juice” -- just mouth the
          words -- it looks exactly like
          you’re saying “I love you.”

Kit mouths the words “olive juice.”

                    MIKE
          Wow, it does!

As they gently kiss...

                    KIT
          Olive juice.

                    MIKE
          Olive juice, too.


INT. KIT STUDIO APT — JAN 2002

Mike's pulling a sweater off the shelf of his now completely-
packed side of the closet.
                                                        30.


                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Things were going so well, Kit
          decided it was time for me to meet
          his mother. Well not Kit, Kit's
          appendix.

Kit's curled up in bed.

                    KIT
          I don't think I can go. I'm sorry,
          I don't feel good.
              (off Mike's worried look)
          Take Nina, she loves screenings.

As Mike goes over to feel his forehead...

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          The movie was great. The message I
          got after the movie was not. We're
          about to go to a hospital, but
          don't worry, we're not at the bad
          part yet.


INT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - ER - LATER

Mike, breathless, reaches the Nurse Station. A weary NIGHT
NURSE looks up from behind a COMPUTER.

                    MIKE
          I'm here to see Kit Cowan. He was
          rushed here for surgery.

As the Nurse searches for Kit in the system...

                    NURSE
          And you are?

                    MIKE
          I’m his... boyfriend.

                    NURSE
          There’s no Kit Cowan here.

                    MIKE
          He said Mount Sinai. It’s Cowan
          with a “W.”

                    NURSE
              (off her screen)
          There’s a Christopher Cowan.
                                                        31.


                    MIKE
          Christopher Cowan?
              (covering)
          Yeah, that’s him. Obviously.
          Christopher.

Mike's phone buzzes, he looks at the caller ID.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          Shit.

Mike stares at his flip phone as it keeps ringing...

                    NURSE
          You going to answer that?

                    MIKE
          It's his mother. Oh god, he asked
          me to call her and tell her not to
          come to the hospital. I've never
          even met the woman.

                    NURSE
          How long have you known this guy?

                    MIKE
          Jesus, Mary and Joseph...
              (finally answering)
          Hello... Yes, this is Mike. Is this
          Mrs. Cowan?... Yes, Christopher’s
          fine... It was just a little touch
          of appendicitis... Yep, he said
          there’s no reason for you to
          come... He’s okay, really. He’s at
          a wonderful hospital... Mount
          Sinai, but you don’t have to
          worry... 10th Avenue... Between
          58th and 59th... Michael...
          Ausiello... No, you wouldn’t have,
          we only recently met... Through
          friends... Yes. Yes... I’ll tell
          him you’re coming.
              (ending the call)
          Shit.


INT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM - LATER

Mike tiptoes in... As soon as he sees Kit, incapacitated and
hooked up to an IV, his heart skips a beat. Kit manages a
smile as Mike leans in and gives him a kiss.

                    KIT
          You’re here...
                                                32.


                    MIKE
          How do you feel?

                     KIT
          Can't really feel much of anything
          at the moment.
              (beat)
          Did you call her?
              (off his look)
          When does she arrive?

                    MIKE
          She'll be here by morning. Sorry.

                    KIT
          Sorry I put you in that position.

                    MIKE
          I told her I was just a friend...

                    KIT
          Speaking of which, I need another
          favor. She stays with me when she
          comes. I need you to swing by my
          apartment and... clean up.

                    MIKE
          Like make the bed?

                    KIT
          No. I don’t remember what I left
          lying around.

                     MIKE
          You want me to de-gay your
          apartment.

                    KIT
          I didn't say that. Just get rid of
          the cum rag next to the bed. And
          the porn DVDs. And the mini statue
          of David with the erect penis.

Mike is calmly taking this all in.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
              (hesitates)
          And probably your Christmas gift...

That one wounds Mike a little.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
              (sheepishly)
          And there's a box of, um...
                    (MORE)
                                                        33.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          toys under the bed. Make sure the
          lid is on it really good.

                    MIKE
          Toys?
              (beat, does the math)
          Ah...

                    KIT
          Like really put your weight into
          it. Make sure you hear it click.

                    MIKE
          Got it. So, to recap: You want me
          to de-gay your apartment.

                     KIT
          Yes, please. I'm sorry I'm such a
          closet case.
              (beat)
          Olive juice?

                    MIKE
          Yeah, I love juice too.


INT. KIT STUDIO APT - DAY - JAN 2002

Mike’s on the bed, the BOX on his lap. As he pokes around
inside, we hear rattling and clanking. His expression
fluctuates between curiosity, shock, and interest.

                    MIKE
          Wow.

Mike stares down at the box of sex toys, then...

QUICK SHOTS: Mike dumping LUBE and CONDOMS into a pillow
case... The Fucking Dinosaurs and the Peter Meter are next...
Mike looks at the AbFab tapes and hesitates...

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          Could be a tell.

Mike tosses the AbFab tapes into the pillow case. Just before
he leaves he remembers Kit's Christmas gift to him. He opens
the closet door and reluctantly pulls the “MIKE” nameplate
down.


INT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM - LATER

Mike heads in, finds Kit on the edge of his bed. Mike sets a
DOCTOR SMURF figurine down on his tray.
                                                          34.


                    MIKE
          I brought a world class surgeon to
          help with the case...

                    MARILYN (O.C.)
          They’re ready to discharge you.

Mike turns to see MARILYN COWAN, 60s, as no-nonsense as
advertised, standing in the door.

                    MIKE
          You must be Mrs. Cowan. We spoke.
          On the phone. Last night. I’m Mike.

Marilyn nods, then turns to Kit, noticing Doctor Smurf. She
looks at it with an equal measure of confusion and fear. As
she begins to gather Kit’s things, Mike butches it up.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          You missed a good match last night,
          man. I mean, game. Man.

                    KIT
              (whispering)
          What are you doing?

                    MIKE
          So you're feeling better, dude?

                    KIT
              (whispering)
          Stop it. Stop. I told her.
              (a little louder)
          I told her.

Mike suddenly gets it. Shocked, he turns to Marilyn, who’s
now looking back at them, holding up Kit’s pants.

                    MARILYN
          Kit needs to get dressed.

No one moves, the tension is palpable... it finally dawns on
him what she means.

                    MIKE
          Oh... I’ll step out.

                    MARILYN
          No. Stay. It’s not like you haven’t
          seen him with his pants off.

                    KIT
          Mom! Jesus!
                                                           35.


                    MARILYN
          What? You tell me you’re gay and a
          split second later the room fills
          with gay people.

                    KIT
          One gay person, Mom, my boyfriend.

Michael is moved hearing Kit refer to him as his boyfriend.

                    MARILYN
          I can’t even have a moment to talk
          with you alone about this?

                      MIKE
          I’ll go.

                      KIT
          No. Stay.

A frozen Mike flashes a "I've died and gone to hell" look.

                    MARILYN
          Stay! Kit obviously doesn’t want to
          be alone with his mother!

             KIT                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
Mom--                              I’m sorry I’m not maternal.

                    KIT
          I never said that--

                    MARILYN
          Warm. I’m sorry I’m not warm. And
          I’m sorry I did whatever I did that
          made you feel like you couldn’t
          tell me... until...
              (off Mike)
          You had no choice.

Mike stares dumbfounded at the scene unfolding before him...

                    KIT
          I didn't want to tell you until...
          I met someone.

That stops Marilyn cold. She looks Mike up and down, her
expression impossible to read.

                    MARILYN
          I’m going to find a nurse.

Marilyn strides out of the room.
                                                        36.


                    KIT
          I tried to warn you.

                    MIKE
          Did you really just come out to
          your mother for me?

                    KIT
          Not you. Us.

                    MIKE
          Olive juice.

                    KIT
          I love Jews, too.

                    MIKE
          I love Lucy.

Mike stares at him for a moment.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          I love you.

                    KIT
          I love you.

Marilyn walks back in, followed immediately by a nurse with a
wheelchair.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          My ride's here!


INT. KIT APARTMENT — LATER

Kit slowly enters, with Marilyn right by his side. She is
carrying all of the suitcases and bags. A slightly deflated
Mike pulls up the rear looking every bit the third wheel.

As Kit gets settled into bed, Marilyn places the suitcases on
and around Kit's desk. She clocks the Sneaky Pete's Magic Set
with the Christmas bow still on top. She connects the dots
and it stings. She quietly locks eyes with Mike.

                    MIKE
              (swallows hard)
          Um.... Kit, while you settle in,
          I'll go pick up some dinner.

                    MARILYN
          It's taken care of, Mark.
                                                          37.


                    KIT
          It's Mike, mom.

                    MARILYN
          I made Kit's favorite. It's in the
          duffel.
              (to Kit, enthused)
          Pig's stomach soup.

Mike cackles loudly... before quickly stopping himself when
he realizes she wasn't kidding.

                    MARILYN (CONT'D)
              (to Mike, pointed)
          Maybe go ahead and put it in the
          fridge, Mike?

                      MIKE
          On it.

Mike exits for the kitchen with the duffel bag.


INT. KIT APARTMENT — KITCHEN — MINUTES LATER

Mike is unpacking the duffel bag and realizes Marilyn brought
a lot more than just soup. There's fresh fruit, bread,
cookies, and various Tupperware containers with assorted
homemade goodies. They're all perfectly wrapped/labeled. Her
attention to detail and level of care is not lost on Mike.


INT. KIT APARTMENT — MINUTES LATER

Mike enters the main living area and finds Kit is gone.

                    MIKE
              (concerned)
          Where's the patient?

                      MARILYN
          Bathroom.

                      MIKE
          Is he OK?

                      MARILYN
          Yes.

Marilyn stops what she's doing and abruptly turns to Mike.

                    MARILYN (CONT'D)
              (resolute)
          I can take it from here.
                                                          38.


                    MIKE
              (reluctant)
          Mrs. Cowan, I...

                    MARILYN
              (interrupts, fighting back
               tears)
          I'm only here a day. Please let me
          take care of my son. You can have
          him back tomorrow.

Mike is thrown by Marilyn's sudden burst of vulnerability. He
backs down. Kit enters the bedroom and can immediately feel
the tension in the room.

                    MIKE
          I think I'm gonna go.
              (to Kit, whispers)
          You good?

                     KIT
          I am good.
              (beat, whispers sweetly)
          Thank you.

Mike and Kit exchange "olive juices" with their mouths.

                    MIKE
          Mrs. Cowan, nice to meet you.

                    MARILYN
          Nice to meet you too, Mike.
              (turns to him)
          And it's Marilyn.

Mike accepts the olive branch as he heads out.


EXT. CHRISTMAS TREE LOT - DAY - DEC 2002

As Mike and Kit choose a Christmas tree...

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          It wasn't long after Marilyn went
          back to Millersburg that we moved
          into our first apartment together.
          It was a modest one bedroom in my
          favorite neighborhood, the West
          Village.
                                                           39.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - NIGHT - NOV 2002

Mike and Kit's home furnished with a tasteful mix of classic
mid-century furniture, eclectic novelty items and... Smurfs.
We see Mike lining up more than a few of his prized Smurf
figurines on an exposed section of their Hans Wegner wall
unit under the watchful eye of Kit, who is trying to contain
his agony. Kit motions to Mike that he has a better idea.

                    MIKE V.O.
          There was an adjustment period,
          during which compromises were made.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Kit is back in front of the wall unit, but this time he has
relocated Mike's Smurfs to one of the wall unit's shelves
that are hidden behind a door. He also curated Mike's
collection so the display looks more refined than flea
market. Off Mike considering the compromise.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - NIGHT - DEC 2002

Mike’s in front of the small Douglas Fir tree they chose.
With child-like joy, he’s adding thick layers of tinsel
strands. Kit looks on warily.

                    MIKE V.O.
          Christmas proved especially
          challenging...

                    KIT
          You know, less is more, especially
          with tinsel.

                    MIKE
              (playfully)
          What are you, the tinsel police?

Kit points out a particular ornament -- a knitted Smurf.

                    KIT
          That one needs to be retired. It
          looks like he was shot in the face
          with a bazooka.

Kit’s gone too far. Mike looks hurt, actually tearing up.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          I’m sure he has a nice personality.

Mike’s too upset now, he turns and walks away.
                                                        40.


                    KIT (CONT'D)
          Come on, I was joking.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - MOMENTS LATER

Mike’s on the bed. Kit stands in the doorway.

                    KIT
          I was just art directing. Art
          directors are notorious pricks.

                    MIKE
          My mom made that ornament, you
          notorious prick.

                    KIT
              (sighs)
          I'm sorry. I think I'm still
          adjusting to the... blending of our
          styles. I've never lived with
          anyone before.

                    MIKE
          Neither have I.

                    KIT
          Look, I made all the big decorating
          decisions in the apartment. It's
          only fair that you have some
          autonomy with the Christmas tree.

                    MIKE
              (skeptical)
          Really?

                    KIT
          Yes. This year. Next year I'm in
          charge of the Christmas tree.

Mike considers the compromise.

                    MIKE
          Deal.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - LATER

Kit's eyes are covered as Mike switches on the tree lights.
The tree looks... very Michael.

                    MIKE
          OK, you can look now.
                                                        41.


                    KIT
              (pulling his hands away
               from his eyes)
          Oooooh.
              (playfully assumes role of
               art critic, vamping)
          Oh, I see what you did there. Nice.
              (beat, eyes moving around
               the tree)
          Respectable tinsel spacing in the
          lower quadrant, yep, yep.

                    MIKE
          You hate it.

                    KIT
              (silliness continues)
          Star on top — bold.

Mike slides under the tree flat on his back with his head
looking straight up into the lights.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
              (confused)
          What's happening.

                     MIKE
          Join me.

Kit joins him under the tree.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          When I was a kid I would spend
          countless hours doing this. I loved
          how the tree looked from this
          perspective. Just a jumble of
          lights and ornaments and tinsel...
          There's something magical about it.

                    KIT
          I love your love of Christmas.

                    MIKE
          My little shop is going to have the
          most amazing Christmas display.
          It's gonna take your breath away
          when you walk past the storefront.

                    KIT
          Could this shop by any chance also
          sell an aggressively curated
          selection of mid-century furniture
          and original photography?
                                                        42.


                     MIKE
          I'd have to ask the owner, but I
          don't see why not. He's very
          agreeable.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT — DEC 2003

Mike and Kit lounge in their apartment. MISTER SCOOCH, their
new cat, explores his new lair.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Things were perfect for a while.
          Deciding to take turns decorating
          our Christmas tree really helped.

We watch as Mike slyly rolls his eyes at the very different
looking silver aluminum Christmas tree with all black
ornaments that stands in the corner.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - MONTAGE

We see a series of PHOTOGRAPHS. Mike and Kit standing next to
their very distinct versions of a CHRISTMAS TREE.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Thirteen years go by pretty quick
          when you count by trees.


INT. THE REVEL HOTEL AND CASINO - SUITE — FEB 2014

Mike walks in to find Kit lying on the sofa.

                    KIT
          So how much did you win?

                    MIKE
          Seven hundred dollars.
              (then, emphatically)
          Your doctor's appointment is
          tomorrow, right?

Kit nods, unconvincingly.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          You did make an appointment, right?

Kit nods, again unconvincingly.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          OK, out with it.
                                                        43.


Kit winces, looks up at Mike, and knows he can't keep lying.

                     KIT
          My appointment was yesterday.
              (beat)
          They found a growth. In my butt.

                    MIKE
              (panicked)
          What... ?

                    KIT
          They don’t know what it is. It
          could be nothing. It might be a
          giant hemorrhoid. I’m getting it
          biopsied on Wednesday.

                    MIKE
          Why didn't you tell me?

                    KIT
          I didn't want to ruin your party.

                    MIKE
          I'm going with you.

                    KIT
          It's just a biopsy.

                     MIKE
          I'm going with you. Not up for
          discussion.
              (beat)
          Do you want me to sleep here
          tonight?

                    KIT
          No, I'm fine.

                    MIKE
          Are you sure?

                    KIT
          Yes.

                    MIKE
          Text me if you need anything.

                    KIT
          I will. I promise.

A clearly concerned Mike exits Kit's suite.
                                                          44.


INT. THE REVEL HOTEL AND CASINO - HALLWAY — CONTINUOUS

We follow Mike as he walks down to the other end of the
hallway, removes his key card and enters a different room.


INT. THE REVEL HOTEL AND CASINO - MIKE'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS

Mike enters and we see that his open suitcase is on the desk
and he has clothes spread about. It's clear in this moment
that — twist! — Mike and Kit are not sharing a room.


INT. TVLINE OFFICE — MIKE’S OFFICE - FEB 2014

A corner office, with two Mario Bellini couches and an Edward
Wormley mahogany pedestal desk. Windows overlook Midtown.
PHOTOS highlight his fifteen-year career on the walls.

Mike rushes out the door, as he gives orders to his assistant
ERIC, 20s.

                    MIKE
          Netflix is buying all seven seasons
          of Gilmore Girls. I want a package.
          Twenty-five Best Episodes and Five
          Worst. Up today.

Eric leaves, and just as Mike's about to, Nick appears.

                    NICK
          Time for lunch and you're paying. I
          lost a month's worth of commissions
          on your birthday, so...

Mike stares at him, trying to figure out what to say.

                    NICK (CONT'D)
          What's wrong? Did they cancel
          Community again?

                    MIKE
          I'm sorry. I can't go, something
          came up.

                    NICK
          You can deal with it after lunch.

                     MIKE
          I actually can't.
              (then)
          It’s Kit. I have to go to the
          hospital. He's getting a biopsy.
          You can't tell anyone.
                                                          45.


                    NICK
          What's wrong?

                    MIKE
          They found a growth.

                    NICK
          Whoa...

                     MIKE
          It could be nothing. It could be
          something.

                    NICK
          Are you sure you're up for this?

                    MIKE
          Do I have a choice?

                    NICK
          Actually, you do now. You guys
          broke up.

                    MIKE
          He came to my birthday party. I can
          go to his biopsy.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          So... you're probably wondering
          about the breakup. It happened a
          few weeks before Atlantic City, but
          the trip was already planned and
          invitations had gone out and we
          didn't want to turn a birthday
          celebration into a pity party. So
          we waited and told everyone the
          following week.


CHYRON: DELETED SCENES


EXT. TRIBECA ART GALLERY — DAY — MAR 2008

A stressed-looking Kit steps outside for some air. Mike
follows him.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Like every couple, we had our
          issues.

                    MIKE
          What is going on with you?
                                                        46.


                    KIT
          I'm just tired.

                    MIKE
              (not buying it)
          Everyone loves your work. Tonight
          is a big success.

                    KIT
          They're just being polite. It's a
          disaster. The retouching on the
          gazebo print is just... sloppy.

                    MIKE
          I feel like we are at different
          events...

                     KIT
          Everyone standing around judging.
              (beat)
          I appreciate you doing this for me.
          Renting the space. Paying for the
          catering. But this isn't me.

                    MIKE
          You are so talented. Do you really
          want to spend the rest of your life
          designing sandwich boards?

That one hurt Kit, and Mike knows it.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like...

Kit turns around and walks back inside.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          I never got Kit to show his
          photography again.


INT. MIKE AND KIT’S APARTMENT — BEDROOM -- 2012

Mike and Kit lie in bed. Mister Scooch is nearby. Mike's on
his laptop, Kit's on Grindr. Mike clocks this.

                    MIKE
          We agreed no Grindr-ing in front of
          company.

                    KIT
          Mister Scooch isn’t company. He’s
          family.
                    (MORE)
                                                47.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
              (to Mister Scooch,
               playfully)
          Did you hear what your father just
          called you?

                    MIKE
          You were on it during dinner.
          Everyone saw.

                    KIT
          No one saw. I was on for two
          seconds while you were telling your
          Gilmore Girls story for the 26th
          time this month.

Mike slowly closes his laptop.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          Uh-oh. Mister Scooch, he’s putting
          his work down. This is serious.

                    MIKE
              (voice raised)
          Stop it.

Startled, Mister Scooch hops off the bed.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          You’re high.

                    KIT
              (voice raised)
          Wow, I’m not doing anything right,
          tonight, am I?

                    MIKE
          I’m sorry I tried to have an adult
          conversation with you...

                    KIT
              (interrupts)
          What’s the big deal if they saw me
          on Grindr anyway? I was just window
          shopping. That was our agreement:
          Looking but no touching.

                    MIKE
          They don’t know that.

                    KIT
          Who cares what they think?

                    MIKE
          It’s embarrassing.
                                                          48.


                    KIT
          For who? And why? I should be
          embarrassed because I’m still
          interested in sex?

                    MIKE
          Oh, and I’m not?

                    KIT
          Not with me.

                    MIKE
          You’re not exactly ripping my
          clothes off these days.

                    KIT
              (mumbles)
          Hard to rip your clothes off when
          they’re dead-bolted to your body.

That one stung.

                    MIKE
          Good night.

                    KIT
          Let’s have sex now.

Mike shuts the light off on his end table and begins to
retreat under the covers.

                       KIT (CONT'D)
          I mean it.

Kit starts aggressively tugging at Mike’s t-shirt.

                       MIKE
          Stop it.

Mike tries to fend him off but Kit is determined to get
Mike’s t-shirt off.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          I said enough.

Kit raises his hands in the air as Mike quickly pulls his
shirt back down.

                    KIT
          Let the record show: I tried.
                                                        49.


                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Even though he denied it, I was
          pretty sure Kit was doing more than
          just chatting with guys on Grindr.
          Kit's wandering eye had been a
          recurring issue, with each bump in
          the road getting smoothed over by
          couple's therapy and my own fear-
          driven denial. But then Kit took a
          job as art director of a fancy
          midcentury furniture shop and, as
          my terrible luck would have it, one
          of his co-workers was Olympic diver
          and international gay icon Tom
          Daley.


INT. WYETH — NIGHT —NOV. 2013

Mike rushes in pulling a rolling bag. A reception is just
winding down. Mike looks around and spots Kit talking to
another coworker Todd, 27, gorgeous.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Well, Tom Daley’s doppelgänger, at
          least.

Kit spots Mike and heads over.

                    MIKE
          I’m sorry. The cab driver took the
          Manhattan Bridge even though I
          specifically told him to take the
          Midtown Tunnel.

                    KIT
          You should’ve just taken it home.
          Hans Wegner’s family already left.

                    MIKE
          Fuck. I’m sorry, Kit.

                    KIT
          It’s OK. Go home and unpack. We’re
          just tidying up here.

Mike eyes Todd in the distance.

                    MIKE
          Let me stay and help. It’s the
          least I can do.

                    KIT
          Nope. We’re good. See you at home.
                                                          50.



Kit gives Mike a peck on the cheek before rejoining Todd, who
is now soaking wet wearing nothing but a speedo and both of
his Olympic bronze medals around his neck.

                     MIKE (V.O.)
          So that’s Todd.
              (beat)
          I don’t even know if Todd can swim
          let alone dive. All I knew for sure
          was that I hated him.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM -- LATER

Mike is drinking a glass of wine while watching Chelsea
Lately, as Kit enters.

                    KIT
          You’re still up.

                    MIKE
          You must’ve had a lot of cleaning
          up to do.

                    KIT
          A bunch of us went out for a bite
          to eat.

                    MIKE
          Who all went?

                     KIT
              (sighs)
          You mean was Todd there? Yes. Todd
          was there.

                    MIKE
          Are you fucking him?

                    KIT
          You’re drunk.

                    MIKE
          Answer the question.

                    KIT
          No, I am not fucking Todd. How many
          times do I have to tell you that?

                    MIKE
          I suppose as many as it takes for
          me to believe you.
                                                           51.


                    KIT
          Well, I didn’t believe you when you
          said you would make it back from LA
          in time for tonight’s reception,
          which you knew was important to me.

That one lands. There's a deafening silence between them.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          I’m hopping in the shower and going
          to bed.

Kit exits as Mike’s eyes begin to well up. He shuts the TV
off, stands and walks to the bedroom. Kit is disrobing. Mike
stops at the doorway, his head down. He's crying.

                     KIT (CONT'D)
          This isn't working. We're
          miserable.
              (beat)
          I'm miserable.

                    MIKE
          I'll call Tony. Maybe he can
          squeeze us in for...

                    KIT
              (interrupts)
          No. I'm not climbing back into that
          hamster wheel. It's a no-win
          situation for me. As long as you
          weren't the one who cheated you can
          claim the moral high ground.

                     MIKE
              (anger building)
          So it's my fault because I never
          fucked around behind your back? Do
          you want me to invent a few one-
          night stands so you feel like the
          playing field is more even?
              (beat)
          I'm sorry I'm not like you.

Mike immediately regrets saying that. But it's too late.

                    KIT
          The only reason you're not like me
          is because...

                    MIKE
          Say it.

As Kit is about to head into the bathroom...
                                                        52.


                     MIKE (CONT'D)
          Say it.
              (beat)
          Because no other guy would want to
          sleep with me.

                    KIT
              (adamant)
          I was not going to say that. Don't
          put that on me. Our problem has
          never been about the way I see you.
          That's your fucking baggage.

Kit heads for the bathroom. Off Mike processing everything...

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          A week later he got his own place
          in Brooklyn...


INT. NYC HOSPITAL - ADMISSIONS AREA - LATER

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          ... And now here we are...

Mike and Kit, a bag over his shoulder, stand in front of an
OFFICIOUS NURSE.

                    NURSE
          Name and age?

                    KIT

INT. NYC HOSPITAL - ADMISSIONS AREA - LATER

Mike waits, watching a TV on the wall, his mind reeling. He
looks up when he hears his name...

                    DR. VOIT (O.C.)
          Michael Ausiello?

Mike looks up as DR. VOIT, 50s, walks over. He sits down next
to Mike, who braces himself for the news.

                    DR. VOIT (CONT'D)
          You're Christopher’s partner?

                       MIKE
                 (awkward pause)
          Yes.

                    DR. VOIT
          I’m concerned about Christopher.

                    MIKE
          It’s cancer.

                    DR. VOIT
          Does cancer run in his family?

                       MIKE
          No.
              (beat)
          I don't know. My mother died of
          cancer.

                    DR. VOIT
          I’m sorry to hear that. We don’t
          know what Christopher has yet. I
          just told him the growth was a lot
          bigger than I anticipated. We took
          a piece for testing, we’ll have the
          results in a few days. Whatever it
          is, we’ll treat it.

                    MIKE
          Can I see him?

                    DR. VOIT
          Of course. He's still a little out
          of it. He shouldn’t be alone for
          the next twenty-four to forty-eight
          hours. I assume you guys live
          together?

Off Mike's unconvincing nod...

Mike sits next to Kit, who’s out of it, his eyes just
beginning to open.

                    MIKE
          Hey. How you doing?

                    KIT
          I’m cold. Where am I? Where’s my
          camera?

                    MIKE
              (pulling a blanket up)
          You’re at the hospital.

                    KIT
          I want to go home.

                    MIKE
          You can, soon, but someone has to
          stay with you... I can call Nina or
          your parents, but then you have to
          tell them what's going on.

                    KIT
              (looking very confused)
          What’s going on?

                    MIKE
          The doctor said he filled you in...

                    KIT
          He did? Maybe he did.

Mike starts to realize how out of it Kit is right now.

                    MIKE
          You can stay with me for a couple
          of days.

                    KIT
          I live with you.

                    MIKE
          No, actually, you don’t.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT — BEDROOM — NIGHT

Mike’s trying to get Kit into bed, who's still groggy.

                    KIT
          Where’s my camera?
                                                        55.


                    MIKE
          Probably in Brooklyn.

                    KIT
              (trying to sit up)
          I think it's actually at work.

Mike takes out some pills, hands them to him with some water.

                       KIT (CONT'D)
          Thank you.

                       MIKE
          For what?

                    KIT
          For letting me stay here. I'll go
          home tomorrow.

                    MIKE
          You'll go home Friday. Forty-eight
          hours, they said. Take your pills.

Kit swallows the pills and looks at him, a little afraid to
ask...

                    KIT
          Tell me what the doctor said.

                    MIKE
          It’ll take a week for the results
          to come back.

                    KIT
          I didn't leave any pot here, did I?

Off Mike shaking his head...


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Mike is making the SOFA up with sheets and a blanket so he
can sleep on it...


INT. WYETH — DAY - MAR 2014

Mike walks in and sees Todd, the last person he hoped was
working today. He walks over to him, seeming pretty upbeat.

                    MIKE
          Hey, Todd. Nice to see you dry.
                                                          56.


                     TODD
          What?

                     MIKE
          Nothing.

                    TODD
          Did you have a good birthday party?
          Forty's a big one. Huge.

                    MIKE
          Kit asked me to pick up his camera.

                    TODD
          How's he doing? He hasn't been in
          all week.

                    MIKE
          He's fine. I just need his camera.

There's an awkward silence...

                    TODD
          I'll go get it.

Off Mike wishing he wasn't here...


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - BEDROOM - LATER

Mike comes home to find Kit in an ill-fitting bathrobe,
packing weed into a pipe, watching Drag Race.

                    MIKE
          Where’d you get that?

                    KIT
              (off bathrobe)
          It's yours.

                    MIKE
          I meant the pot.

                    KIT
          You can get it delivered. It’s New
          York City, Mike.
              (off the TV)
          The queens are killing it this
          season.
              (off Mike's look)
          What?
                                                         57.


                     MIKE
          I never thought I'd say this. But
          you should call Todd. He's worried
          about you.

Off Kit taking that in.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT — LIVING ROOM — LATER

Mike is doing the dishes while keeping one eye on Kit, who is
out on the deck, talking on the phone.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          When this is over I'm going to
          write a book called How to Survive
          the Week Between Your Ex-
          Boyfriend's Biopsy and His
          Diagnosis While He Hides From The
          World In Your Apartment...


INT. TVLINE OFFICE - MAR 2014

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          ... all on the eve of one of your
          favorite TV shows being revived.


INT. TVLINE OFFICE - MIKE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Mike runs in. The SOUND GUY and the CAMERA MAN are already
there along with KRISTEN BELL, her PUBLICIST, her MAKEUP
ARTIST, and her PERSONAL ASSISTANT.

                    MIKE
          Please forgive me for being late...

                    KRISTEN
          Mike, don’t worry about it.

                    PUBLICIST
          We need to get started. She has to
          get to Letterman.

ANGLE ON: Mike being mic’d by the Sound Guy. Mike’s phone
buzzes. He checks the caller ID.

                    MIKE
          I’m so sorry, I have to take this.

Bell looks confused, Eric looks bewildered, and Bell’s
Publicist looks apoplectic.
                                                        58.


INT. TVLINE OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Mike ducks into a corner and takes the call.

                    MIKE
          Hi.


INT. MIKE AND KIT’S WEST VILLAGE APT — LIVING ROOM - INTERCUT

Kit’s strangely calm...

                    KIT
          It’s a neuroendocrine tumor.

                    MIKE
          A neuro-what?

                    KIT
              (spelling it)
          N-E-U-R-O-E-N-D-O-C-R-I-N-E

                    MIKE
          Let me get a pen.

Mike grabs one and scribbles it down on a scrap of paper.

                    KIT
          They gave me a number for an
          oncologist.

                    MIKE
          What else did the doctor say?

                    KIT
          Nothing. That’s it.

                    MIKE
          So it’s cancer.

                    KIT
          Yeah. I just said that.

Off Mike looking at that scrap of paper.


INT. TVLINE OFFICE - MIKE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

When Mike returns, the Sound Guy’s staring at him. Mike sees
the mic clipped to his shirt. The Sound Guy heard everything.
Mike’s at a loss for words. Kristen picks up on Mike's
distress as he retakes his seat across from her.
                                                        59.


                    KRISTEN
          Everything OK?

                       MIKE
                 (trying to shrug it off)
          Yep.
              (beat)
          Sorry again for the delay.

                    KRISTEN
          No worries.

The makeup artist quickly approaches Michael.

                    MAKEUP ARIST
          You're a little shiny...

She proceeds to powder his sweaty forehead. She steps back to
survey the result.

                    MAKEUP ARIST (CONT'D)
          All better.

The makeup exits the shot.

                    CAMERA GUY
          And... we're rolling.

Mike shifts into interview mode. He flashes a wide smile at
the camera.

                    MIKE
          I’m here with Veronica Mars
          herself, Kristen Bell. So nice to
          have you here.

                    BELL
          I'm glad to be here.

                    MIKE
          After all the blood, sweat and
          tears you — and the fans — put into
          making this movie revival happen,
          how does it feel to be just days
          away from its release?

                     KRISTEN
          It’s hard to articulate. It's
          overwhelming, it's exciting, it's a
          little nerve-wracking, because it's
          really important to me that the
          fans who funded this movie are
          satisfied.
                                                          60.


Mike tries mightily to stay focused as Kristen talks, but we
can see the struggle in his eyes (and once again on shiny
forehead).


INT. TVLINE OFFICE - MIKE'S OFFICE - LATER

Mike’s alone now, typing “neuroendocrine tumors” into a
search engine.

ANGLE ON: the search results, one after another... “Many are
benign...” “Malignant tumors tend to...” “Poorly
differentiated...”

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          “Neuroendocrine tumors are
          neoplasms cells from the endocrine
          and nervous systems...” “Many are
          benign...” I liked the sound of
          that... Then I made the mistake of
          adding rectum to the search...

ANGLE ON: Mike typing RECTUM after NEUROENDROCRINE TUMOR.
More results flood in...

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          “Prognosis is poor in those rare
          cases where the neuroendocrine
          tumor is located in the rectum...
          It is almost always fatal... Life
          expectancy less than one year.”

Mike slams his laptop shut.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - LATER THAT NIGHT

Mike comes home to find Kit dressed, the bag he took to the
hospital by his side.

                    MIKE
          Where are you going?

                    KIT
          Home. To Brooklyn.

                       MIKE
          Stay here.

                    KIT
          It's been forty-eight hours. I've
          been enough of an imposition.
                                                61.


                    MIKE
          It's no imposition. Honestly.

                     KIT
              (clocks concern in Mike's
               eyes)
          I know this is bringing up a lot of
          stuff for you. But I'm not your
          mother.

                    MIKE
              (defensive)
          I know.

They stare at each other for a moment...

                    KIT
          So how bad is it?
              (off his silence)
          You went online. I know you.

                    MIKE
          I did some digging.

                    KIT
          So?

                    MIKE
          It’s the same cancer Steve Jobs
          had.

                    KIT
          That can’t be good.

                    MIKE
          But he had it on his pancreas. And
          he delayed treatment.

                    KIT
          I won’t make that mistake. Anything
          else?

Mike takes a moment... and then lies.

                    MIKE
          It turns out this kind of cancer is
          rare so there wasn’t a whole lot of
          info. I got the names of the city’s
          three best neuroendocrine experts.

                    KIT
          You made a list?
                                                        62.


                    MIKE
          When you get better, you can go
          back to your hovel. Right now you
          need to be here, in Manhattan,
          where the doctors are. Perfectly
          healthy people have died waiting
          for L trains that never came!

                    KIT
          Is this how you are at work?

                    MIKE
          I’m a top at the office.

                    KIT
          Can I at least get some clothes?


INT. KIT'S BROOKLYN APT — DAY — MAR 2014

Mike scans the room for the first time. He’s never seen Kit's
apartment. His bedroom wall is bare. His framed photos from
the 2008 art show are leaning against the wall.

                    MIKE
          These are beautiful. I'll never
          understand why you won't...

                    KIT
              (shutting him down)
          Mike...

                       MIKE
          I'm sorry.

Mike turns to see Kit moving slowly, clearly in pain, as he
sets a duffle bag on the bed.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          Sit. You point, I’ll pack.

Grateful, Kit gingerly lowers himself onto the bed while Mike
starts to fill the duffel bag with clothes from Kit’s closet.

                    KIT
          You don't have to do any of this.

                    MIKE
          I know. Where's your pot?

Kit points to the bedside table. Mike opens the drawer, takes
out a Tupperware container, puts it in the duffel bag. Kit
winces in pain.
                                                           63.


                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          When are you going to tell your
          parents?

                    KIT
          When I know exactly what we're
          dealing with.


INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY — MAR 2014

Mike and Kit sit in front of DOCTOR BARNES, Mike clearly
running the room.

                    MIKE
          So, is surgery an option?

                    DOCTOR
          It could be. But you need to start
          chemotherapy immediately.

                    MIKE
              (holding up his cell)
          You mind if I record this?

                    KIT
          Sorry. He’s a journalist.


EXT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY - MAR 2014

Kit and Mike are at a table, menus in front of them,
listening to the recording Mike made of Doctor Barnes on his
phone.

                    KIT (ON TAPE)
          Can I beat it?

                    DOCTOR (ON TAPE)
          I believe you can. You’re young and
          healthy.

  DOCTOR (ON TAPE) (CONT'D)                   KIT
Those things are very           Yeah, but first my hair is
important. I’m optimistic.      going to fall out, food will
                                taste like shit. I won’t be
                                able to work.

       DOCTOR (ON TAPE)                      MIKE
Well, there are multiple        I liked this guy better than

                                                        64.


                    MIKE (CONT'D)
              (turning phone off)
          He said you can beat it.

                    KIT
          How many more do I have to meet?

                    MIKE
          Just one. And then you can pick.

                    KIT
          How do people work for you? You’re
          exhausting.


EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET — DAY

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Our last oncologist was Dr. Carrie
          Bradshaw.

CLOSE ON: DR. DAVIS, 30s, her makeup and hair perfect,
wearing a halter top and short skirt, walking down the
sidewalk... A very Sex and The City opening credits vibe.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Well, she looked like and dressed
          the Sex and the City icon. I got a
          good vibe from her.

Close on the wheels of a BUS heading toward a PUDDLE. Cut to
Mike, who's now the one walking down the street.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Until she opened her mouth.

Mike tries to avoid it but the bus sprays him with water. He
looks up to see an ad on the side of the bus featuring a
glamor shot of Dr. Davis, with copy reading, "Dr. Davis Knows
Cancer."


INT. SLOAN KETTERING - EXAM ROOM - LATER

Kit and Mike sit across from Dr. Davis. Kit shifts in his
seat. He can’t get comfortable.

                    DR. DAVIS
          You have an extremely aggressive
          form of cancer.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          She wasn't Carrie Bradshaw. She was
          the Grim Reaper.
                                                        65.


                    MIKE
          The other oncologists said that
          between chemo and radiation,
          there’s a lot of hope here.

                    DR. DAVIS
          The problem is his tumor is already
          at an advanced stage.

Mike and Kit quickly lock eyes.

                    KIT
          What stage are we talking?

                    DR. DAVIS
          Stage four. I’m sorry.

The air goes out of the room...

                    KIT
          No one’s said anything about a
          stage before...

Mike turns to Kit, wanting to say something to help, but he
can’t find the words.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          What are we looking at here, Doc?

                    DR. DAVIS
          In terms of time?

                    KIT
          Yes.

                    DR. DAVIS
          We don’t like to give numbers.
          Patients are not numbers--

                    KIT
          Please, Doctor.

                    DR. DAVIS
          About a year.

Mike reaches out his hand to Kit who pulls away.

                    KIT
          I need a minute. Please give me a
          minute.

Dr. Davis nods, stands and leaves, quietly closing the door.
Mike and Kit sit alone...
                                                        66.


                    KIT (CONT'D)
          I need a minute.

                    MIKE
          I’m not leaving you alone.

                    KIT
              (screaming)
          I need a minute!

His intensity hits Mike in the gut as Kit rushes into the
exam room’s private bathroom, closing the door behind him.
Mike stands there helplessly.

Then he hears Kit start to cry. Mike can barely stand to
listen as Kit HOWLS in despair. Mike can’t take it anymore.
He rushes out to...


INT. SLOAN KETTERING - HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Mike catches up with Dr. Davis...

                    MIKE
          Please, Dr. Davis. Say something to
          him. Anything.


INT. SLOAN KETTERING - EXAM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Mike follows Dr. Davis back in as Kit is exiting the
bathroom, his eyes bloodshot now.

                      KIT
          I’m okay.

                    DR. DAVIS
          Christopher, everyone is different.
          And the year time frame is a range.
          It could be more than a year.

                    MIKE
          So he could have more time?

                    DR. DAVIS
          You could. But you need to start
          treatment as soon as possible.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Despite Dr. Davis' questionable
          bedside manner, she won the
          oncologist bake-off. Sloane
          Kettering was the Rolls-Royce of
          cancer facilities.

                    MIKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And as much as I tried to deny it,
          her dire prediction was in sync
          with what I secretly read on Web
          MD.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT — LIVING ROOM — NIGHT

Mike’s asleep on the sofa, when he stirs, thinking he hears
something. Moaning? He looks at his phone: 3:30 AM.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - HALL - CONTINUOUS

Mike’s outside the bathroom door. Kit’s moaning is louder
now, getting worse.

                    MIKE
          Are you okay?

                     KIT (O.C.)
          I feel like I’m pushing barbed wire
          out of my ass.
              (then)
          I'm sorry I woke you. I'm the worst
          roommate.
              (off Mike's silence)
          Can you hand me the issue of Dwell
          by the bed?

Mike returns with the magazine and slides it under the door
then sits against the wall outside the bathroom while Kit
continues to moan.

                    MIKE
          Do you still want to go tomorrow? I
          can cancel the car.

                      KIT
          No. I need to tell them, and I want
          to do it in person.
               (then)
          I can’t promise I won’t shit in the
          car.

                    MIKE
          It’s a rental.

He can hear Kit laugh from the other side of the door.
                                                        68.


INT./EXT. CAR - MILLERSBURG - SUSQUEHANNA RIVERBANK - LATER

Mike and Kit drive through the small town where Kit grew up.
MUSIC from the car stereo plays in the background. Kit’s in
the passenger seat, taking photos of the passing sights...


INT./EXT. CAR - MILLERSBURG - DOWNTOWN - LATER

As they head into downtown Millersburg, Mike narrates the
sights with a teasing flourish.

                    MIKE
          Sorrento’s Pizzeria is just up the
          street... Best subway sandwiches in
          the North East. And the beauty
          parlor over there used to be the
          five-and-dime. You'd buy candy with
          the money you made from school. You
          charged kids a nickel--

                    KIT
          A dime.

                    MIKE
          A dime to return their lunch trays
          and everyone had a spare dime
          because lunch cost ninety cents.

                    KIT
              (pointing)
          And that’s the Millersburger Hotel.

                    MIKE
          Where you got your first real job.

                    KIT
          And my first blowjob. From Andrea
          Sobiesk.

                    MIKE
          You never told me that. Is there a
          historical marker? A bronze plaque?


INT./EXT. - MILLERSBURG - SIDE STREET - LATER

                    KIT
          I’m going to need a hit.

Mike pulls over, shuts the engine off, and opens the windows.
The sound of an occasional bird chirping and the river
flowing in the distance. Kit packs a one hitter, takes a hit.
                                                        69.


                     KIT (CONT'D)
          You know, Andrea still works at
          that hotel.
              (then)
          If I weren’t gay, I probably never
          would have left this town either.

                    MIKE
          Gay did you a favor.

                    KIT
          My parents don't know we broke up.

                    MIKE
          Are you going to tell them?

                     KIT
              (shrugs, then)
          Let's drop the first bomb and
          assess the damage.
              (beat)
          Either way, she's gonna want to
          come to New York for the chemo
          treatments. And... whatever comes
          after. I really don't want to give
          her a ringside seat but...

Kit's gets choked up as he ponders the potential horrors of
chemo.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
              (fighting back tears)
          As much as I don't want her to
          come, I may actually need her help.

                    MIKE
          Kit, I can take some time off of
          work...

                    KIT
              (interrupts)
          No. You are not doing that. Thank
          you, but no.

Mike opts not to fight this particular battle now.


INT. KIT’S CHILDHOOD HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Mike and Kit sit on the couch in a cozy living room. Marilyn
sits with BOB, 60s, much quieter than Marilyn. Kit’s trying
not to look uncomfortable, but he’s in pain.
                                                        70.


                    MARILYN
          You should have let me know you
          were coming. There’s not enough
          food in the house.

                    BOB
          What brings you boys down?

                    KIT
          We have news.
              (off Marilyn's look)
          It’s not good.


EXT. KIT’S CHILDHOOD HOME - DRIVEWAY - LATER

Mike’s getting their bags out of the car. When he closes the
trunk, he sees Marilyn standing beside the car.

                    MARILYN
          We're going to the supermarket. Kit
          wants scrapple for dinner and I'm
          all out of cornmeal.

                    MIKE
              (thrown)
          But...

                    MARILYN
          Kit knows. He's busy fixing Bob's
          computer. Come on.

As Marilyn climbs into her and Bob's nearby SUV, Mike's face
fills with dread.


INT. BOB AND MARILYN'S SUV — CONTINUOUS

Mike climbs into the passenger side of the SUV and closes the
door. There's a moment of uncomfortable silence, during which
it becomes clear that Marilyn is not making any effort to
start the car. Mike reluctantly looks over and sees her
crying. He mouths "fuck," before closing the door. There's an
agonizing, heartbreaking silence. Michael reaches deep into
his pocket and pulls out a tissue. He hands it to her.

                    MARILYN
              (composes herself)
          He said he can beat it. Is that
          true?

                    MIKE
          That's what two out of three of New
          York's finest oncologists told us.
                                                71.


                    MARILYN
          And the third?

                    MIKE
              (chooses his words
               carefully)
          The third... was a real asshole
          about it.

                    MARILYN
          I knew he was gay...

                    MIKE
              (mumbles)
          Oh boy...

                    MARILYN
          ...I acted like I was shocked when
          he told me, but I knew. I've known.
          I tried to convince myself
          otherwise. And I said nothing. All
          of those years he was dealing with
          this by himself all alone with no
          one to talk to... I could've been
          there for him.

                    MIKE
          I think you're being a little hard
          on yourself...

                     MARILYN
          All of those years I could've been
          getting to know my son for who he
          is and not for what I wanted him to
          be. I will never get that time
          back. So much wasted time.
              (beat)
          This is my long-winded way of
          saying I have a favor to ask.

                    MIKE
              (tentative)
          OK...

                    MARILYN
          I want to come to New York.

Mike was expecting this.

                    MARILYN (CONT'D)
          I promise I won't be a nuisance.
          Lord knows I don't want to make
          things worse for him. Maybe just
          once a month for an overnight.

                                                        72.

                     MARILYN (CONT'D)
          Bob and I will get a hotel room.
          Kit will fight me on it. But I want
          — I need — to get a little of that
          lost time back. Will you help me
          with that?

                    MIKE
          I will do my best.

                     MARILYN
          Thank you.
              (looks at Mike)
          I know he's in good hands. I
          remember how you were with him
          after he got his appendix out. I
          felt threatened by it then. But now
          I'm just grateful. I am grateful he
          has you.

There's an awkward silence.

                    MARILYN (CONT'D)
          He does have you, right?

Off Michael's conflicted expression, we...


INT. SLOAN KETTERING - CHEMO WARD - DAY - MAY 2014

RUTH, 40s, a chemo nurse, walks Mike and Kit past PATIENTS,
IVs in their arms, while drugs drip into their systems,
leading them to an INFUSION CHAIR. Mike’s not happy when he
sees the chair.

                    MIKE
          Excuse me. We were promised a bed.

                    KIT
          Mike, it’s okay.

                    MIKE
          No. No. It’s not okay.

                    RUTH
          We don’t have any beds today. Have
          a seat. We’ll be right with you.

As Ruth walks off, Mike turns to Kit.

                     MIKE
          Do not sit down.
               (calling out to the Nurse)
          Hey!
                                                        73.


                    MIKE (V.O.)
          I don’t know what came over me.

Mike chases after the nurse. He’s followed by a HAND HELD
CAMERA... Mike hurries past a loudly MOANING PATIENT on a
gurney as EDIE FALCO (loosely in character as Nurse Jackie)
tends to him. He passes a PATIENT getting defibrillated by
CHANDRA WILSON (loosely in character as Grey's Anatomy's
Bailey)...

                    CHANDRA WILSON
          Clear!

Mike rushes past a GRIEVING HUSBAND who’s weeping, having
just been told his wife is dead by ZACH BRAFF (loosely in
character as Scrubs' J.D.).

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Things quickly escalated into
          “Terms of Endearment” territory...

Mike reaches the NURSE'S STATION, where he slams his hands
down.

                    MIKE
          Give my husband the bed!

                    RUTH
          Sir, I’m afraid--

                    MIKE
          Give my husband the bed! He has a
          rectal tumor the size of the Death
          Star. He’s in too much pain to sit
          for five minutes, much less four
          hours of chemo! He needs a bed. We
          were promised a bed!

                    RUTH
          All the beds are occupied today.

                    MIKE
          I don’t care where you find one! I
          don’t care if you have to drive to
          IKEA and buy one! You are going to
          give my husband a bed!

                    RUTH
          Okay, sir. Okay. We’ll find your
          husband a bed.

He finishes up, just as Shirley McClaine did...
                                                        74.


                    MIKE
          Thank you...


INT. SLOAN KETTERING - PRIVATE ROOM - LATER

Kit lies on his side in a bed in what is clearly one of Sloan
Kettering’s private luxury VIP suites, an IV in his arm. Mike
sitting nearby, opening his laptop. As Ruth leaves...

                    KIT
          So where's my toaster?

                     MIKE
          Shut up.

                    KIT
          I mean that was Oscar worthy. But
          I’m not your husband.

                    MIKE
          They don’t know that.

They both smile...

                    KIT
          You don’t have to wait with me.

                    MIKE
          I have work to do.

                    KIT
          Then go to work.

                     MIKE
              (off laptop)
          I am at work.
              (looking up at him)
          I worked too much. If I wasn’t at
          work, I was watching TV, which was
          work. And once I could watch TV
          anywhere, and break stories on my
          phone from anywhere, I was always
          at work.
              (closing his laptop)
          I’m sorry.

Mike reaches over and gently takes Kit’s camera, which is
lying on the bed. He points it at Kit.

                    KIT
          No cancer photos.

Kit rolls his eyes, while Mike looks at him through the lens.
                                                         75.


                    MIKE
          I promised your mother a photo.

                     KIT
          What kind of backroom deal did you
          make with my mother at the
          supermarket? And why wasn't I
          consulted?

                     MIKE
          That's between me and her.
              (beat)
          One photo. Please.

                    KIT
          Fine... If you must.

As Mike takes a photo...


EXT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT — DAY - MAR 2014

Mike and Kit head toward their front stoop, Kit's walking
slowly and arduously. It looks like he might fall for a
second and Mike reaches out to take his arm.

                      KIT
          I'm fine.

                      MIKE
          You sure?

                    KIT
          Yes, I can still walk by myself.
          Thank you very much.

Kit continues slowly up the steps as Mike nervously watches
him go, confused and exhausted.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - KITCHEN - LATER

Mike’s pouring wine when he hears a thump from the bedroom...


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mike rushes in to find Kit, naked, lying facedown on the bed
with his head in a pillow, panting, his body trembling.

                    MIKE
          What’s happening?
                                                          76.


                    KIT
          I’m having pain.

                       MIKE
          Where?

In between labored breaths he manages to say...

                    KIT
          Grab me a towel.

Mike rushes into the bathroom, grabs a towel, returns to the
bed and places it over his soaking-wet body.

                    MIKE
          Where does it hurt?

                    KIT
          And the magazine...

Mike runs into the   bathroom to grab the Dwell magazine, which
has been rolled up   some. He hands it to Kit, who grabs it and
squeezes it tight.   As it registers with Mike that he has been
using the magazine   as a pain stick...

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          I think it’s passing.

Mike watches him for a moment to make sure he’s okay.


INT. MIKE AND KIT’S WEST VILLAGE APT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Mike heads into the living room, looks at the couch... He
picks up his pillows and heads back into...


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mike returns with his pillows, lies down beside Kit, rolls
over facing the wall... On the other side of the bed, Kit
turns his head, sees Mike...

                       KIT
          Goodnight.

                       MIKE
          Goodnight.


EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY - MAR 2014

It’s one of those rare days in early spring where New Yorkers
are actually happy.
                                                           77.


Mike and Kit sit on a park bench, silently taking in the
scene. Kit’s got his point-and-shoot and snaps a pic of a
YOUNG COUPLE lying on a blanket.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          He was in the middle of his first
          round of chemo, and I was hoping it
          was half as hard on his tumor as it
          was on him.

Then Kit leans over, puts his head between his legs, and
vomits.


INT. MIKE AND KIT’S WEST VILLAGE APT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT -
APR 2014

Kit heads into the living room to find Mike asleep, his
laptop resting on his stomach. He gently picks it up and lays
it on the coffee table, as Mike stirs...

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          But the old Kit still made
          appearances.

                    MIKE
          Hey, what time is it?

                    KIT
          Ten. Go to bed.

Mike slowly sits up, Kit scratches his head. It turns out his
hair is falling out. There are strands all over his hands.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          Look!

Kit tugs at his hair now, pulling out a clump this time.

                    MIKE
          Oh, my God!

He pulls out another clump. He grips his hair with both
hands, makes a crazed face, and starts pulling fistfuls out.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          Don’t do that! Stop!

But Kit does it again — coming at Mike like a lunatic now,
tearing out ever-larger clumps.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          Stop that! It’s getting everywhere!
                                                        78.


Kit’s chasing Mike through the living room, both laughing,
until Mike falls back onto the sofa, with Kit landing next to
him. They lie there, looking at hair everywhere...

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          Remember how you hated Mister
          Scooch for shedding?


INT. VILLAGE BISTRO - NIGHT - MAR 2014

Mike, Kit, Nick, Riley and Nina are crowded into a booth.
Nick reaches for the bread, Riley slaps his hand away.

                    RILEY
          You said no bread. No matter how
          much you begged.

                    NINA
          Things straight men never say to
          each other.

                    MIKE
          Good for you, Riley, standing up to
          him like that. I like you.

                    KIT
          You made it all the way from his
          birthday party to the end of my
          chemo. You're a survivor, too.

Mike looks up and sees Todd heading towards them.

                    TODD
          Hey.

There are looks all around as Todd sits down next to Kit.
Mike tries not to look rattled.

                    MIKE
          Hi.

                    KIT
          I invited some people from work.

                    TODD
          The others are coming.

Off Mike, clearly a little rattled.
                                                         79.


INT. GYM — LATER

Mike runs on a treadmill, sweat pouring down his face. He
notices a HOT GUY in the weight area is cruising him.


INT. GYM — LOCKER ROOM — LATER

Mike, freshly showered, in just a towel, opens his locker,
then looks over and sees the Hot Guy from the weight area. He
makes sure Mike sees him enter the steam room. After a
moment’s hesitation, Mike closes his locker.


INT. GYM — STEAM ROOM — LATER

Mike sits, a towel around his waist. As the steam thins a
little, he sees the Hot Guy sitting across from him.

The Hot Guy walks over and sits next to him. They sit there
motionless for a moment. Mike starts to cry.

Mike just sits there as the Hot Guy watches him cry...

                    HOT GUY
          Dude? Are you okay?

Off Mike, weeping...


INT. DR. DAVIS’S OFFICE - DAY - APR 2014

Mike and Kit sit across from Dr. Davis.

                    DR. DAVIS
          I’m afraid the news isn’t good.

Mike takes Kit’s hand.

                    DR. DAVIS (CONT'D)
          The tumor has grown. We also found
          nodules in the pelvic region.

                    KIT
          At least my tumor has company.

                    DR. DAVIS
          We’re going to stop chemo and take
          a short break in your treatment so
          you can get your strength back.
          Then we’ll start a course of
          radiation — five days a week.
                                                          80.


                    MIKE
          And that can work?

                    DR. DAVIS
          It has proven effective in some
          cases. It could buy us some time.

                    KIT
          I just want to live to see the end
          of Drag Race.


INT. SLOAN KETTERING - WAITING ROOM - NOV 2014

Kit walks out of his radiation appointment to find Mike
waiting for him.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Much to everyone's pleasant
          surprise, the radiation began to
          succeed where the chemo failed.

                    KIT
          God, I can't get over how fast
          radiation is. It's like 'wham bam
          thank you ma'am.' Fifteen of 'em
          down, five to go!


EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET — LATER

As they leave the hospital, Kit's clearly walking faster and
better than we have seen him in a while. Mike is actually
trying to keep up with him.

                    MIKE
          Hey, if you’re really serious about
          a weekend away, I found a place on
          the Jersey Shore that you’d love...

                    KIT
          Are you kidding me? Book it!


EXT. OCEAN CITY, NEW JERSEY - DAY - JUL 2014

A RENT-A-CAR cruises across a COUNTRY ROAD.


INT. RENT-A-CAR - CONTINUOUS

Mike’s driving. Bob’s up front with him, working on a Book of
Sudoku puzzle. Kit’s in the back seat. Marilyn’s next to Kit.
                                                           81.


                    MIKE
          He can stand. He can walk. He can
          sit without pain.

                    KIT
          Our little friend has been zapped
          into oblivion.

                      MARILYN
          Oblivion?

                    MIKE
          Significantly. The doctor said his
          tumor has shrunk significantly.

                    KIT
          She said it could buy us a lot of
          time. We might be talking five, six
          years. And then who knows, there
          might be a cure.

Mike and Marilyn exchange a look in the rearview mirror.

                    MIKE
          We’re almost there...


INT. PORT-O-CALL HOTEL — PENTHOUSE - LATER

The ELEVATOR door opens and Kit, Mike, Marilyn, and Bob walk
out into the suite with the same panoramic views of the
Atlantic Ocean. Mike’s got a bag full of stuff for Kit: meds,
mats, pillows, and bottles of ENSURE.

                    BOB
          Look at this place...

                    MARILYN
          Oh, my Lord, listen to the waves!

Mike leads them through the living room, the dining room and
out onto the TERRACE... Marilyn marvels at the view as she
steps up to the railing. Mike walks over to Kit...

                    KIT
          This is perfect.


EXT. PORT-O-CALL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - PATIO - DAY

Mike sits in a lounge chair beside Marilyn, whose nose is in
a NOVEL. Mike has a Diet Coke and his iPad. Bob’s asleep and
Kit blows Super Miracle Bubbles through a plastic wand.
                                                        82.


                    MARILYN
          Where’d he get the bubbles?

                    MIKE
          The gas station.

Kit picks up his camera and holds the lens right up against
the bubble wand’s hole. He points the camera toward the sun
and starts snapping away.

Kit struggles trying to hold the bubble wand and the camera.

                    KIT
          Mom, help me.

Both Mike and Marilyn look up, concerned.

                    MIKE
          Are you alright?

                    KIT
          Yes, I just need her to hold this.
              (off the wand)
          It’s like a glycerin-y filter, I’m
          getting an awesome effect.

Bob’s watching this whole thing unfold as Marilyn gets up and
takes the wand from Kit and holds it out...

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          A little to the right.

                    MARILYN
          There?

                    KIT
          Yeah. Hold it still. Like that.

Marilyn laughs as Kit leans into her, snapping away. Mike’s
moved by the scene unfolding in front of him.


INT. PORT-O-CALL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mike and Kit lie in bed together, watching RuPaul's Drag Race
on Mike's laptop. Kit starts to rub Mike's leg.

                     MIKE
          That’s my leg.
              (beat)
          And now that's my...
                                                        83.


Mike’s expression slowly changes as he lets Kit continue.
They slowly roll toward each other as Mike starts to
reciprocate.

They look into each other’s eyes as their shoulders begin to
move up and down. They keep stroking each other as their
breathing gets heavier and heavier... Until they both climax.
After a long moment...

                      KIT
          Too soon?

                    MIKE
          Too messy. I’ll get a towel.

Mike gets up, then turns back to Kit.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          What was that?

                    KIT
          I think we just hooked up.

Off Mike, taking him in...


EXT. PORT-O-CALL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - PATIO - MORNING

Mike comes outside, about to take a run. Marilyn’s looking
out over the ocean.

                    MARILYN
          Morning, how's he doing?

                    MIKE
          Good... really good. He’s still
          sleeping.

                    MARILYN
          How did you find this place?

                    MIKE
          I’ve been here before. As a kid. It
          was the last family trip we took
          before my mother died.

Marilyn and Mike exchange a look.

                    MARILYN
          Did the doctor really say he could
          have another five years?

Mike takes a moment, he wants to believe that so bad.
                                                        84.


                    MIKE
          They can't put a number on it but
          things are really looking good.

Marilyn breathes in the ocean air.

                    MARILYN
          Thank you for inviting us to join
          you guys.

                    MIKE
          It was actually Kit's idea.

                    MARILYN
          You don't have to say that...

                      MIKE
          I'm not. I wouldn't. It was his
          idea.
              (looks into Marilyn's
                eyes)
          He wanted you here.

Marilyn is overcome. She grabs Mike's hand on the railing and
squeezes it.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          I was actually vehemently against
          it.

                    MARILYN
          Alright, Mark. That's enough out of
          you.

As we hold on Mike and Marilyn sharing a laugh while taking
in the sea air we cut to...


EXT. PORT-O-CALL HOTEL - BEACH - NIGHT - JUL 2014

Mike and Kit are on a empty section of the beach, on a
blanket, a bag of PRETZELS and a bottle of WINE beside them.
A group of friends can be seen in the background encircling a
makeshift camp fire, the embers casting a warm glow on the
beach. Mike and Kit lie in each others’ arms.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          And for a second I actually thought
          everything was going to be okay...

Until Kit sits up, puts his head in his hands.

                    KIT
          I have a headache.
                                                        85.


Off Mike's concerned expression...


INT. MIKE AND KIT’S WEST VILLAGE APT — LIVING ROOM - NIGHT —
JUL 2014

Kit's on the sofa on his side watching RuPaul’s Drag Race.
Mike’s in the kitchen when Kit’s cell rings. He checks the
caller ID.

                    MIKE
          It’s Dr. Davis.

Mike answers the call and activates the speaker function.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          Hi Dr. Davis. You’re on speaker.

                       KIT
          Hi, Doc...

                    DR. DAVIS (O.C.)
          Hi, guys. So, the news isn’t good,
          I’m afraid. We found a number of
          nodules on the brain. Several of
          them located near the brain stem,
          which is most likely what’s been
          causing your headaches.

                    MIKE
          How big are they?

                    DR. DAVIS (O.C.)
          They’re fairly tiny, but there are
          a lot of them. And your primary
          tumor is growing again.

                    KIT
              (stoic)
          What are we looking at here,
          Doctor? Six weeks? Six months?

                    DR. DAVIS (O.C.)
          More than six weeks. Six months...?
          Probably not.

                    KIT
          But, I’ve been feeling so much
          better.
                                                         86.


                    DR. DAVIS
          The radiation won you some time.
          But at this point all we can really
          do is address your symptoms and...
          manage your pain.

Mike starts to cry.

                    KIT
          Thank you for letting us know,
          doctor.

Mike ends the call. Kit remains silent. Mike puts his arms
around him.

                    MIKE
          I hate her so much.

Suddenly, Mike lets go of Kit and snaps open his lap top.
Mike starts typing feverishly.

                    KIT
          What are you doing?

                    MIKE
          I read about a targeted treatment
          for NETs being developed in
          Germany. It’s called...

             KIT                          MIKE (CONT'D)            *
Mike...                           Afinitor. It blocks this like    *
                                  protein signaling pathway        *
                                  that can malfunction and        **
                                  contribute to--                  *

                     KIT
          We’re going to Germany now?
              (beat)
          It’s everywhere. It’s in my brain.

                    MIKE
          Afinitor reduced the risk of
          disease progression or death by
          seventy-nine percent in--

Kit reaches over, closes the lap top. Mike can’t believe it.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          There’s a lot of experimental
          research going on right now.

                    KIT
          Stop it. Please stop.
                                                          87.


                    MIKE
          We can’t give up just because the
          Grim Reaper told us to.
              (voice catching)
          I’m not ready.

                     KIT
          I am... I’m actually kind of
          relieved. I know where I stand now.
          It’s weirdly comforting.
              (then)
          Stop trying to fix this.

Mike just stares at him, devastated...

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          I have some new pot I wanted to
          try. How about you get a glass of
          wine and meet me on the deck?


EXT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - DECK - LATER

Mike climbs out of the window balancing   a glass of wine in
his hand. Kit’s already there, lying on   his side, packing a
bowl, with Mister Scooch curled up next   to him. Mike takes a
seat on the deck and observes Kit for a   moment.

                    MIKE
          Are you afraid to die?

                     KIT
          No. I’m not. I’m scared of what the
          end looks like, but not of dying.
              (then)
          Please don't let me die in a
          hospital.

Mike looks haltingly at Kit.

                     KIT (CONT'D)
          Promise.
              (beat)
          I want to die at home.

                    MIKE
          Millersburg?

                    KIT
              (shakes his head)
          No. Here.

Mike is moved. Kit lights up, takes a long pull and exhales.
                                                        88.


                    KIT (CONT’D)
              (playfully)
          Mister Scooch, did you hear him
          promise, yet?

                       MIKE
          I promise.

                    KIT
          Mister Scooch and I thank you.

Mike takes a sip of wine. He’s enjoying the family moment.

                    MIKE
          Had you not approached me that
          night I don’t think we ever
          would’ve met.

                    KIT
          You were so lost. It was adorable.

                    MIKE
          You were so out of my league.

                    KIT
          I just wanted to take you home and
          fuck you.

                     MIKE
          I needed to be fucked.
              (beat)
          But I was afraid if you saw me
          naked you’d cut and run. So I
          seduced you with my sparkling wit
          first.

                     KIT
          Considering your shtick is way
          scarier than your body that was a
          risky bet.

Mike chuckles.

                    MIKE
          I’m sorry, Kit.

                       KIT
          For what?

                    MIKE
          For blaming you for... everything.
          For not owning my role in all of
          it. My body issues. My fear of
          loss.
                                                   89.


                    KIT
          The Smurfs...

                     MIKE
              (nods)
          The Smurfs...

                    KIT
          Your questionable sense of style...

                    MIKE
              (interrupts)
          Settle in there tiger.

Kit smiles. He takes another long pull. Exhales.

                    KIT
          Got anything else you want to ask
          me? It’s now or never.

Mike considers the question.

                    MIKE
          Did you have sex with Todd?

Kit wasn't expecting that...

                       KIT
          Yes.

                       MIKE
                 (exhales)
          OK.

                    KIT
              (tearing up)
          I’m sorry I lied to you, Mike.
              (crying)
          I am so sorry.

                    MIKE
          It’s OK. I forgive you.

The F-word triggers a wave of relief in Kit.

                     KIT
          Thank you.
              (beat, through tears)
          Thank you, Mike.

Kit slowly regains his composure.
                                                         90.


                    KIT (CONT'D)
          I want you to be happy. I want you
          to fall in love again...

                    MIKE
              (interrupts, fighting back
               tears)
          Nope. Not ready to have this
          conversation with you...

                     KIT
          All I am saying is if you meet
          someone...

                    MIKE
              (abruptly)
          Got it. Message received. Thank
          you. Come again.

Kit chuckles. Mike takes a sip of wine. They sit there
silently.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          You know what? I think I’m ready to
          try some of this pot you’ve spoken
          so highly of.

                    KIT
              (thrown)
          Really?

                    MIKE
          Yep. It’s time.

                    KIT
          Get over here.

Mike put his wine glass down and Kit hands him the one-
hitter. Mike looks at it confusingly, before putting it in
his mouth backwards.

                    KIT (CONT’D)
          OK, so first thing’s first...

Kit gently pulls the one hitter out of Michael’s mouth and
turns it around.

                    KIT (CONT’D)
          It goes this way.

                     MIKE
              (nods)
          I see it now. Makes sense.
                                                        91.


                    KIT
          Now light the other end with the
          lighter, and then inhale slowly.
          Don’t exhale right away. Let it sit
          in your lungs for a few seconds.

Mike struggles with the lighter and hands it to Kit.

                    MIKE
          I can’t do it.

                    KIT
          Yes you can.

Mike nods, then tries again. Nada. Once more. Finally, a
spark. Mike quickly holds the flame to the pot and takes a
very quick hit. He’s proud of himself.

                    KIT (CONT’D)
          That wasn’t a very long hit. You
          might not feel anything...

                    MIKE
              (interrupts, panicked)
          My throat is burning.

                    KIT
              (calmly)
          Relax...

                    MIKE
          It’s on fire.

Kit hands Mike his glass of wine. He takes a sip.

                    KIT
          Better?

                    MIKE
          Yes. But I’m not feeling anything.

                    KIT
          Take another hit. And this time,
          hold it in for a few seconds.

Mike takes another hit, holds it, exhales, doesn’t cough. He
lies down beside Kit and looks up. His eyes trace the
branches of the tree hugging their deck.

                    MIKE
          I think I’m feeling it.

                    KIT
          Welcome to the Stoners Club.
                                                        92.


A super relaxed Mike falls into Kit's arms and they hold each
other tightly.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

Mike is awake but still in bed staring longingly at a still-
sleeping Kit. Kit slowly opens his eyes.

                    KIT
              (groggily)
          Good morning. How are you feeling?

                    MIKE
              (interrupts)
          Let's get married.

                     KIT
              (thrown)
          I'm sorry, what?
              (beat)
          How much pot did you have?!

                       MIKE
          I mean it.

                    KIT
          You're only asking me because I'm
          dying.

                     MIKE
          It's more than that. You know, I
          thought I was scared of marriage.
          But I think it was divorce that
          terrified me. I was so afraid of
          our relationship being deemed a
          failure that it didn't seem like a
          risk worth taking. Why rock the
          boat. So I pretended like it didn't
          mean anything. But it does. I love
          you. I want to be your husband. And
          I want to spend the rest of my life
          with you.
              (beat)
          Will you marry me, Kit Cowan?

Kit is profoundly moved by the proposal.

                    KIT
          The funny thing is, we actually
          could use a new toaster.

Mike smiles, and then they kiss. It's followed by an awkward
silence.
                                                        93.


                    MIKE
          Well, you better get dressed.

                       KIT
          Today?!

                    MIKE
          I texted Nina and Nick, they’re
          meeting us at City Hall. We don’t
          know how much longer you're going
          to be of sound mind.

                    KIT
          You're fucking nuts.

                    MIKE
          The only thing we don't have are
          rings, but we can always...

                    KIT
              (wheels turning,
               interrupts)
          Wait a second.

Kit turns around and opens the drawer of his end table. He
pulls two SPIDER RINGS out of his pocket, the ones he won in
Atlantic City. He proudly displays them to Michael, who
flashes him a "I could not love this man more" look.


INT. CITY HALL - MARRIAGE BUREAU - LATER

There’s a crush of couples, some in traditional attire, most
not. As Mike and Kit wait their turn, Nick takes photos on
his phone.

Nina rushes in a small box of cupcakes and a TOASTER. She
hands the cupcakes to Mike.

                    NINA
          These are for you.
              (hands the toaster to Kit)
          And this is for you.

Kit smiles at the gesture. The digital number display clicks
over.

                       KIT
          That’s us!
                                                           94.


INT. CITY HALL - MARRIAGE BUREAU - MOMENTS LATER

The clerk slides their signed license across the counter with
their birth certificates.

                    MIKE
          Where do we go now?

                    CLERK
          Are you getting married here?

                      KIT
          Yes.

                    CLERK
          Wait twenty-four hours and return
          with your marriage license.

                    KIT
          We need to get married today.

                    CLERK
          Why the rush?

                    NICK
              (off Kit)
          That one has cancer.

                    CLERK
          Oh... Look, you’ll need a waiver
          from a judge. Across the street.
          But we close at noon today. Hurry.

                    KIT
          Okay, less talking. More running.

Kit clicks the morphine pump for a hit before they go.

                    CLERK
          What’s that?

                      KIT
          Morphine.

                      CLERK
          Cheers.

Off Mike and Kit, taking off.


EXT. 60 CENTER STREET — LATER

Mike, Kit, Nick, and Nina head up the steps of 60 Center
Street, the New York Supreme Court Building.
                                                        95.


Kit’s going as fast as he can. There’s a FILM CREW shooting
an episode of Law & Order: SVU while a scrum of TOURISTS
watch.

Mike, Kit, Nick, and Nina are blocked by an officious twenty-
something PRODUCTION ASSISTANT with a walkie-talkie.

                    KIT
          We have to get in there now!

                    PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
          It’ll just be a few minutes.

They wait impatiently till Mike realizes they’re not rolling.

                    MIKE
          This is bullshit-- they’re not even
          rolling! Let’s go!

They push past the Production Assistant, through the crew,
and up the steps.

                    PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
          Hey! Stop! Jesus!


INT. 60 CENTER STREET - MOMENTS LATER

They all empty their pockets into trays and go through the
metal detector. Nina puts the toaster on a tray, which of
course sets off the machine...

                    NINA
          Sorry! It's just a toaster!


INT. 60 CENTER STREET - JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - LATER

They rush in, cupcakes and toaster in tow. The JUDGE’S CLERK,
a schlumpy, slow-moving bureaucrat, doesn’t even look at
them.

                    SCHLUMPY CLERK
          The judge is done for the day.

                    KIT
          We have extenuating circumstances!

                    SCHLUMPY CLERK
          Do you? What are they?
                                                           96.


                    KIT
          Just look at me. I’m obviously
          dying. We have to get married
          today.

                    SCHLUMPY CLERK
              (finally looking up)
          I’ll see what I can do.

The Schlumpy Clerk disappears into the judges chambers.


INT. 60 CENTER STREET - JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER

They stand waiting.

                    MIKE
          We only have twenty-five minutes.

                    NICK
          You had thirteen years.

                    NINA
          I’m glad you two finally came to
          your senses.

                    KIT
          I’d like a cupcake.

                    NINA
          No! It’s bad luck to eat wedding
          cake before the wedding!

                    KIT
          Nina, how much worse can it get?

As Kit bites into a cupcake the Schlumpy Clerk trots back
into the room, winded, and hands them the waiver.

                    SCHLUMPY CLERK
          You’re all set. All the best.

Kit takes the toaster from Nina.

                    KIT
          Thank you. So much. This is for
          you.

Kit slides the toaster over to him. As they rush off...

                    SCHLUMPY CLERK
          I can't accept gifts!
                                                           97.


EXT. 60 CENTER STREET - TOP OF THE STEPS - LATER

On the way out they encounter the same Production Assistant.

                    PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
          We’re rolling. You’re going to have
          to wait here.

                    KIT
          Do you know who this is? If you
          want a future in television, you’ll
          let us pass. He's a big deal.

                    MIKE
          He's not wrong.

                    NINA
          Look, asshole.
              (off Kit)
          This is my best friend and all he
          wants to do is marry his boyfriend
          here, who actually is a big deal--

                       MIKE
          Thank you.

                    NINA
          He turned out to be one of the most
          amazing people I've ever known.
          They don't have a lot of time. So I
          don't care what stupid show you're
          making--

                    MIKE
          It's actually a great show.

                    NINA
          The marriage office closes in ten
          minutes. Please let us through.

The Production Assistant looks from Mike and Kit to the
ACTORS.

                    PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
          Go. Now. Hurry up.

                       DIRECTOR (O.C.)
          Action!

                       PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
          Shit.

It's too late. Mike, Kit, Nina and Nick are rushing past
MARISKA HARGITAY, who's standing on her mark.
                                                           98.


                    DIRECTOR (O.C.)
          Cut! You’ve got to be kidding me!
          Re-set!

                    MIKE
          Hey, Mariska!

                      MARISKA
          Mike! Hi!

                    MIKE
          Mariska! Sorry for fucking up your
          shot!

                    KIT
              (yelling back to PA)
          I told you he was a big deal!

As the four of them hurry down the steps...


INT. CITY HALL - WEDDING CHAPEL - LATER

Mike and Kit hold hands in front of a very jaded looking
OFFICIANT. Nina and Nick are taking pictures.

                    OFFICIANT
          Do you have rings?

Kit sets the two spider rings on the podium. The Officiant
does a double take, and then starts reading off a piece of
paper.

                    OFFICIANT (CONT'D)
          Do you, Christopher, solemnly
          declare Michael to be your husband?

                      KIT
          I do.

                    OFFICIANT
          Do you promise to love, honor, and
          keep him for as long as you both
          shall live?

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          I had forgotten about that part.

                      KIT
          I do.

Nina cries as Mike and Kit try to maintain their composure.
                                                        99.


                    OFFICIANT
          You can place... that ring... on
          his finger.

Kit slides a spider ring onto Mike’s finger.

                    OFFICIANT (CONT'D)
          Do you, Michael, solemnly declare
          Christopher to be your husband?

                    MIKE
          I do.

                    OFFICIANT
          Do you promise to love, honor, and
          keep him for as long as you both
          shall live?

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          There it was again.

                    MIKE
          I do.

Mike slides the other spider ring onto Kit’s finger. Now Nick
starts to cry.

                    OFFICIANT
          By the powers vested in me by the
          great state of New York, I now
          pronounce you married. You may seal
          your vows with a kiss.

Mike and Kit lean in and kiss...

                    KIT
          I wrote down some vows.

                    MIKE
          You did? When? I didn’t.

                    KIT
          It’s alright, Mike, these can be
          for both of us.

Kit grabs his iPad from Nina and fires it up.

                    KIT (CONT'D)
              (reading from the iPad)
          I knew immediately that...
              (his voice cracks)
          Here. I can’t do it. You read them.

Mike takes the iPad from him, takes a breath, and reads...
                                                       100.


                    MIKE
          I knew immediately after we met
          that you were the one. The last
          thirteen years haven’t always been
          easy, but we always find our way. I
          love you. I love us. We are in this
          together and now it’s official.
          Nothing can say what you mean to
          me. You are my best friend and I
          can’t imagine my life without you.

Mike rests the iPad on the podium and they wrap their arms
around each other.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S APARTMENT - DAY - LATER

Kit’s asleep, his head is on Mike’s shoulder. Mike’s eating
the last cupcake. Mike's phone buzzes.

                    MIKE
              (picking up)
          Hi, Marilyn...

Mike gently wakes up Kit.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          It’s your mom.

                    KIT
              (taking the phone)
          Hey, Mom. We have news... and this
          time it’s good...

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          We were holding out for just one
          more Christmas...


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - EVENING - DEC 2014

Kit, thinner than ever, takes seemingly forever to hang a
round BABY BLUE ORNAMENT on an aluminum Christmas tree.
Nestled next to the bulb is a BABY SMURF. Marilyn tries to
hold back tears as Kit almost stumbles placing another bulb.
Mike, meanwhile, looks like he hasn't slept in a month.

                    KIT
          I’m almost done.

                    MIKE
          It’s beautiful, Kit. Thank you.

Kit smiles, proud of his work.
                                                       101.


INT. MIKE AND KIT’S WEST VILLAGE APT - JAN 2015

Marilyn sits, covering her ears, as two PARAMEDICS carry Kit
out of the apartment on a chair stretcher, which has forced
Kit to sit up. He’s wild with pain, completely delirious.
He's grabbing on to the rolled up Dwell magazine/pain stick
for dear life.

                    MIKE
          He needs a stretcher! He can’t sit!
          He has a tumor in his ass! You’re
          hurting him!

                    PARAMEDIC
          Sir, the stretcher can’t make it up
          this stairwell.


INT. MIKE AND KIT’S WEST VILLAGE APT - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

NEIGHBORS are coming into the hallway. Kit grabs and tears at
Mike’s shirt.

                    KIT
          Why are you doing this to me?!?
          Make them stop! Make them stop!

Suddenly, out of Kit's hands falls the Dwell magazine/pain
stick. Mike quickly picks it up and is shocked at what he
finds. The magazine is so tightly rolled up from nearly a
year of Kit gripping it in pain that it doesn't even resemble
a magazine. It's like a weapon. It's in that moment that Mike
realizes he is holding in his hands physical manifestation of
Kit's prolonged suffering and it's a gut punch. As he holds
it listening to Kit's screams we...


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING - JAN 2015

Kit’s sound asleep. Mike sits at the end of the bed, rubbing
Kit’s feet. Mike looks like a wreck. Marilyn pulls him aside.

                    MARILYN
          How are you?

                    MIKE
          Better now.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          He can't stay here.

                    MARILYN
          This is the best place for him.
                                                       102.


                    MIKE
          I promised him I wouldn't let
          him...
              (fighting back tears)
          He's not dying in a hospital.

Marilyn lays her hand on Mike's shoulder as they both take in
Kit.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NEXT MORNING - JAN 2015

Mike is sitting next to Kit's bed when Todd appears at the
door. Mike, clearly expecting him, gently wakes Kit.

                    MIKE
          Special visitor alert.

Kit opens his eyes. A smile spreads across his face when he
sees Todd.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          He’s good for only a couple of
          minutes at a time.

Todd nods... And Mike leaves, closing the door behind him.


INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING AREA - LATER

Mike sits with Marilyn and Bob. As Mike watches the door to
Kit’s room. Nick and Nina walk over from the elevator.

                    NINA
          How’s he doing?

                     MIKE
          Well enough to have visitors.
              (then)
          Now I just have to get him home. I
          promised.

Just then Todd comes out of Kit’s room. He’s clearly been
crying. Nick and Mike exchange a look, before Mike walks over
to him.

                    TODD
          Thank you for letting me see him.
              (silence, then)
          Kit’s an amazing person and you’re
          an amazing husband. I’m so sorry
          this is happening... I'm sorry for
          everything.
                                                          103.


Todd starts for the elevator, as Mike watches him go...

                    MIKE
          Todd...

Todd stops. Mike walks over and pulls him into an embrace. As
they hold each other, both men are sobbing now...


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT — LIVING ROOM — JAN 2015

Kit, with his morphine pump, sits with pillows propping him
up. Mike plugs their old, seldom-used DVD player into the
back of the television set.

                    MIKE
          I called in every last favor.

                    KIT
          What is it?

Mike turns and faces Kit, holding up a DVD, pleased and
triumphant.

                    MIKE
          The Drag Race season finale.

INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Kit lies on his side, his head against Mike’s shoulder,
trying to find a comfortable position as the credits play.

                    RUPAUL
          You are all winners. You are all
          stars. But only one can be the next
          drag superstar.

As we watch the show A DRAG QUEEN walks into the room and
sits on the arm of the sofa next to Mike. She gently drapes a
comforting arm around his shoulder. A SECOND DRAG QUEEN walks
in and sits next to Kit, resting a hand on his leg. Neither
Mike nor Kit notices their presence.

A THIRD DRAG QUEEN, the most glamorous of the three, comes
behind the sofa and places a bejeweled hand on Mike’s
shoulder. He looks up. They lock eyes. She nods to the TV,
then Mike turns his attention back to the show.


INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT — BEDROOM — FEB 2015

Mike, Marilyn, and Bob are sitting with Kit, his breathing
incredibly labored.
                                                       104.


                    MIKE
          Can I have a moment alone with him?

Marilyn hesitates, unsure if she’s even capable of letting go
of Kit’s hand. Bob takes Marilyn shoulders and gently helps
her stand.

As they leave the room and close the door behind them, Mike
climbs into bed with Kit and stares at him. He grabs the
collar of his sweatshirt, and pulls him closer.

                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          You listen to me: I’m gonna be OK.
          It’s going to be unbelievably hard,
          but I’m going to be OK. You go get
          heaven ready for us because thanks
          to you I have high standards. Thank
          you for giving me a family. Thank
          you for loving me.

Mike realizes he’s still holding him up by his sweatshirt and
gently lays him down on the bed again. Kit, his eyes barely
open, ever so slowly moves his hand toward Mike’s and
squeezes it. Mike squeezes back, as tears fall from his eyes.


INT. MIKE AND KIT’S WEST VILLAGE APT — LIVING ROOM — LATER

Mike walks out of the bedroom, looks at Marilyn and Bob.

                       MIKE
          Thank you.

Marilyn heads back toward the bedroom, followed by Bob. Mike
stands at the door, takes a deep breath... As the camera
pulls back and takes in the window, and pushes out onto the
roof, and further out into the noise and life of New York
City, farther and farther back, as if Kit’s spirit has
finally been set free.


EXT. MILLERSBURG RIVER - DOCK - DAY - MAY 2015

Mike, Marilyn and Bob are standing on a dock. They’re pouring
Kit’s ashes into the river...


EXT. KIT’S CHILDHOOD HOME - PORCH - LATER

Mike walks out and joins Bob, who is sitting in a rocking
chair reading the local paper.

                    MIKE
          Big goings-on in Millersburg?
                                                       105.


                    BOB
          A raccoon snuck into the Dollar
          Store and destroyed the place. It
          took a dozen cops to catch the
          little bugger.

                    MIKE
              (looks at watch)
          Marilyn's been at the supermarket
          for a while.

Long, slightly awkward silence. Bob folds the newspaper up
and places it on the ground next to the rocking chair.

                     BOB
          She's having a difficult time.
          Everything's a painful reminder.
          She can't send emails anymore
          because it reminds her of emailing
          with Kit. She avoids driving down
          Pine street because she can't bear
          to look at Sorrento's.
              (beat)
          She sees you and...

As Bob fights back tears, Mike connects the dots. He looks at
the empty chair next to Bob and the heartbreaking reality
hits him: Marilyn can't bear to be around him. As Mike
quietly swallows that bitter pill...

                    BOB (CONT'D)
          She's just gonna need some time.


EXT. MILLERSBURG RIVER — LATER

Mike pulls over alongside the river and gets out of his car.
He sees Marilyn sitting on a bench, alone, staring out at the
river. He slowly approaches and stands beside her. Marilyn is
crying.

                       MARILYN
          I'm sorry.

Mike, hurt, takes her in, then gently says.

                     MIKE
          Before I leave, I have a favor to
          ask. I would very much like a hug.
              (beat)
          It can be a quick.

A teary Marilyn rises and faces Mike. They embrace,
triggering a wave of emotion in Mike.
                                                       106.


                    MIKE (CONT'D)
          Thank you for Kit.

                    MARILYN
          No. Thank you.


INT. KIT’S BROOKLYN APT - DAY - MAY 2015

Mike’s cleaning out Kit’s apartment with Nick, Riley and
Nina. The place is already half empty.

                    NINA
          Kit was my third boyfriend who came
          out in college. I had this magical
          effect on boys.

                    NICK
          There are some guys at my gym I’d
          like you to meet.
              (off Riley)
          Kidding.

                    RILEY
          You wouldn't last a day without me.
              (picking up a box)
          What’s in here?

Mike, Nick and Nina exchange a look.

                    NICK
          What are you going to do with
          those?


EXT. GOODWILL - LATER

Mike and Nina are dropping the last bags into the donation
area. GOODWILL WORKERS are going through everything. Mike
runs back to the car and gets Kit’s box of sex toys.

                    MIKE
          Start the getaway car.

Mike runs back to the donation table, sets the box down, then
hurries back to the car along with Nina. They hop back in,
laughing, as Nina pulls away.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          The thing about endings... it’s
          never really the end.
                                                       107.


INT. HUDSON, NEW YORK — STORE - NIGHT — DEC 2045

Mike, who has aged beautifully, sits behind the counter.
Surrounding him is a mix of mid-century designer furniture
and Smurf collectables. Mike hands a small bag and some
change over to a young GAY MAN and his HUSBAND.

                    MIKE
          Enjoy. Happy Holidays.

                    GAY MAN
          Does that sofa really sell for ten
          thousand dollars?

                    MIKE
          Yep. It’s a Finn Juhl.

                    HUSBAND
          That Smurf, holding a red apple
          inscribed with “I love NY... ,” how
          much is that?

                    KIT (O.C.)
          Only a hundred of those were made.

We see a beautifully-aged Kit standing at the entrance of the
store, having just walked in from outside...

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          It’s actually not for sale. It’s
          part of my husband’s private
          collection.

Mike smiles, it’s nice to hear the Smurf Expert side of Kit.
As the couple starts to leave, Kit turns to Mike...

                    KIT (CONT'D)
          It's snowing.


EXT. HUDSON, NEW YORK - STORE - LATER

Mike steps outside in an oversized jacket. It’s not only
snowing, it’s snowing in a picture perfect small town. He
turns to admire their quaint row house, taking in the
gorgeous store window. He looks up at their six-over-six sash
windows on the second and third floor... Suddenly all six
windows on both floors simultaneously light up with
multicolored C9 old-timey bulbs, all diligently measured out
for peak symmetry. It’s magical.

Just then Kit comes outside with their rambunctious GOLDEN
RETRIEVER, who bounds toward Mike.
                                                       108.


                    MIKE
          Jibber Jabs!

Mike takes the leash from Kit and manages to put it on the
dog. They make their way down the street, hand-in-hand. Mike
stops for a moment as Kit walks on ahead... Mike stands all
alone now, watching, as Kit slowly disappears into the snow.


EXT. SKY - JUNE 2015

A bright blue sky empty, save for a PLANE that slowly enters
the bottom of the frame, arching upwards...


EXT. PIER - SAME

Close on Mike watching, as the plane moves across the sky.

                    KIT (V.O.)
          I asked myself where are we going?
          Wondered if our tickets are for the
          same destination. On the same
          flight? Have your seat belt
          securely fastened...

Mike lies back as the SUN pours down on him.

                    KIT (V.O.)
          There may be unexpected
          turbulence... If I’m scared, I’ll
          know you’re in the seat next to
          me... Holding my hand... Telling me
          we’re going to be okay.

As we pull away we see Mike’s walking down the Santa Monica
pier. We see him take his shirt off mid-stroll. The camera
pulls back farther and takes in LA...


                           THE END
