                                              FADE IN ON:


INT. JAIL CELL, RIKER’S ISLAND, WOMENS’ WARD - DAY

CHYRON - NEW YORK CITY, 1994

The grace of a little sun pushes through a barred window. It
illuminates four brick walls aging in yellow paint, a toilet,
and broken locker with the little desk affixed.

A FEMALE INMATE is perched on one of two cots. She’s black,
evidently pregnant and so world-beaten that her thirty years
of age could pass for forty-five. She closes her eyes. From
the opposite cot, another BLACK FEMALE INMATE leans in. She
finishes a touch of lipstick delicately, the way one
glamorizes a little sister.

This is INES DE LA PAZ (22, Black). She’s slim, light brown,
and enterprising enough to maintain the arsenal of goods
crowding the locker top. There’s also a few posters and
fashionable ‘fits strung on a makeshift clothesline.

Ines doesn’t recognize how jilted the woman is as she rises,
turning to clear the adornments on her wall. But then she
turns back, feeling the burn of wanting eyes.

                    INES
          Go ahead, take it.

The older woman giggles as snatches the beauty supplies
scattered on the cot, dashing out before a change of mind.


INT. RIKER’S ISLAND, WOMENS’ WARD - LATER

Ines is back in her element, renewed in street clothes that
pop. These pieces are humble, but boyishly on trend. She
resigns herself to a bench while a MALE CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
finishes processing.

Sensing eyes on him, he glances up. Ines returns a devilish
smile, as if the goal’s to keep his gaze.

                    CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
              (not falling, finishing)
          You’re free to go.

He hands over some scant belongings, including a winter coat.

                     CORRECTIONAL OFFICER (CONT'D)
          Every time I see you, you look
          different.
                                                            2.


                    INES
          Only on the outside.


EXT. COMMERCIAL STREET, MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - LATER

Ines sprawls the winter coat in her clutches as TWO STREET
KIDS weigh the out-of-season bargain. A sea of socio-
economically diverse FOOT TRAFFIC surrounds them.

                    INES
          Right now, $50.


        STREET KID #1                         INES (CONT'D)
Where we goin’ with that?        What you gonna do this
                                 winter?
        STREET KID #2                         INES (CONT'D)
Let me see the label first -     What you gonna do this
                                 winter, lay on your t-shirt?

CLOSE UP on the palm of her hand as street kid #1 slides over
some cash and subway coins.

                    STREET KID #1 (O.S.)
          That’s all I got.

                    INES (O.S.)
              (returning quarters,
               dimes)
          Just give me the tokens -


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, BEDFORD STUYVESANT - LATER

Ines is a force, rapturous and unfazed by the summertime
stick as she jaywalks across the street. A few aggravated
beeps. She sashays between cars like they don’t exist.

In the backdrop behind her, LOCAL BUSINESSES ONE OR TWO
GENERATIONS OLD. They’re not thriving but still standing.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD PARK, BEDFORD STUYVESANT - MOMENTS LATER

From outside the bordering gate, Ines approaches A GROUP OF
CHILDREN–AT–PLAY (ages six to nine). One DAINTY LITTLE GIRL
grabs her attention, braids and beads swinging side-to-side.

                    INES
          Mama!

                    DAINTY LITTLE GIRL
          Huh?
                                                         3.


                    INES
          A little boy named Terry out here?

The little girl shakes her head.


EXT. BASKETBALL COURTS - LATER

Ines halts FOUR MALE YOUTHS engrossed in a half court game.

                       BOY 1
          He ya man?

                       INES
          He’s six.

                    BOY 2
              (heading back to the
               court)
          She mean one of Janie’s kids.

                    BOY 1
          Oh, they not over here.

             INES                              BOY 2
You see him outside?               Nahhh...

                    BOY 3
          Check on Trinity -


EXT. WOMENS’ SHELTER, TRINITY AVE - LATER

Idle chitchat with LOITERING RESIDENTS - a few old friends -
keeps Ines busy. However, she’s distracted by every car,
NEIGHBORHOOD ADOLESCENT, and ADULTS that travels by.

She plops down on a hydrant in defeat. Growing limp, she
pulls out a Newport cigarette. Her ears perk up when THREE
TINY BOYS start yapping near the corner.


EXT. BODEGA WALL, THE CORNER OF TRINITY AVE - MOMENTS LATER

Ines creeps over, staring down at one child in particular.
He’s centered between two other boys, MICHAEL H. (7) and
SHAWN (8) eating Marinos and jumbo icees. She smiles, almost
too shy now to speak.

                     INES
          Little bit.
              (then)
          You don’t hear me calling you?
                                                             4.


                     MICHAEL H.
          Yeah.

                    INES
          It’s him I’m talking to... Remember
          who I am?

TERRY (6), the tiny brown child she’s been looking for,
barely looks up, nodding dismissively.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          Let me see your eyes.

He shrinks further into the bodega wall.

                    SHAWN
          He not gon’ answer, Miss.

                    INES
              (relenting)
          What’s your name?

                     SHAWN
          Shawn.

                     INES
          And you?

                    MICHAEL H.
          My name Michael “H” - there’s two
          of us...

She peers back at Terry, who eases with the heat off him.

                    INES
          Let’s keep this between us,
          a’right?

             INES (CONT'D)              SHAWN & MICHAEL H.
Don’t tell anybody I came by.        (uncaring)
                                  Okay.

She hands Shawn and Michael a little change for the store.

                    MICHAEL H.
          You’re pretty.

                     INES
          I’m gonna be around more often.
          Hear that, T? I just wanna see how
          you doin’.

Terry’s eyes glaze over.
                                                         5.


                    INES (CONT'D)
          I’ll see y’all around.

                    SHAWN
          Bye!

Terry’s the first to run off. The other two follow behind.


EXT. PARK - DAY

Terry’s getting on the monkey bars when he spots her. Ines on
a bench, prioritizing hip hop magazine THE SOURCE over
periodicals. Ines waves... he doesn’t.

                    INES
          Hey!

From Terry’s direction, we hear a scuffle --

He’s fallen to the ground, still kicking defensively at
Michael. His foster mother MS. JANIE (late 40s) intercedes,
yanking Terry up.

                    MS. JANIE (O.S.)
          Aye, none of that!

Ines resists the reflex to step in...


        FOSTER SISTER                     MS. JANIE (CONT'D)
They pulled him down!           Okay, let’s go. Everybody!

                    MS. JANIE (CONT'D)
              (over fuss and moaning)
          If y’all don’t know how to act, you
          can stay inside!

The fussy group grabs their belongings. Ines does too.


EXT. FOSTER HOME - LATER

Ines settles at a bus stop across the street observing the
children file into the house. As if he feels her presence,
Terry sneaks a glance Ines’ way. He’s then yoked inside.


EXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY

A yard full of CHILDREN engaged in recess. Spotting TWO
TEACHERS in the yard, Ines is less brazen in her attempt to
get the attention of Terry’s foster brother, Shawn.
                                                              6.


                       INES
                 (low, waving)
             Shawn!

                       SHAWN
             Huh? Oh, hi.

                       INES
             Where ya friend at?

                       SHAWN
             He not starting school.

                       INES
             Why?

                       SHAWN
             I’m not telling you!

                       INES
             Wow, it’s like that now?

                       SHAWN
             What you gon’ give me if I do?

Shawn looks over at the pack of SOUR POWER STRAWS sticking
out of the brown paper bag in Ines’ hand.

               INES                               SHAWN (CONT'D)
   (cross)                           That one.
Here.

                       SHAWN (CONT'D)
             He in the hospital.

                       INES
             Why?

                       SHAWN
             Running from Ms. Janie like a
             dummy.

Ines sees the two teachers looking her way suspiciously.

                        INES
                 (to the teachers)
             I’m going!

                       SHAWN
                 (munching)
             He fell out the window and hit his
             head -
                                                            7.


INT. RECEPTION AREA, SHITTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT

A FEMALE RECEPTIONIST BANGS the phone receiver down. Ines
arrives to the desk ready to charm, a cute Teddy in hand.

                    RECEPTIONIST
              (unenthused)
          Can I help you?

                    INES
          I believe my son is here.

Other lines ring away, unanswered. The desk is swarmed in
paperwork. The waiting room itself is filled with VISITORS,
eager to be assisted by understaffed personnel.

                    RECEPTIONIST
              (searching)
          What’s his name?

                       INES
          Terry.

                       RECEPTIONIST
          Last name?

Down the hall, Ines spots Ms. Janie surrounded by a FEMALE
CASE WORKER, DOCTOR and TWO POLICE OFFICERS.

                    RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
          Sweetheart.

                    INES
          I’m sorry, what’d you ask?

                    RECEPTIONIST
          We have a Terrance Wallace here. Is
          that who you’re looking for?

                       INES
          Yes.

                    RECEPTIONIST
          Do me a favor and fill this out?

She picks up the sign-in sheet, handing it over to Ines.

                    RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
          I need your driver’s license or
          another form of ID. You said you
          were who again, his sister?
                                                         8.


                     INES
               (lying)
           Damn, I left my wallet at home.
           Can I come back?

                     RECEPTIONIST
           Visiting hours end at ten.


INT. SHITTY HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

INES POV on the officials still in conversation with Janie.
She’s settled in a chair beside SHEILA (85) who’s snoring her
life away. She casually removes the woman’s visitor’s tag.


INT. TERRY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

Donning Sheila’s tag, Ines makes herself at home in the chair
across from Terry’s bed.

                     INES
           You want one?

She sticks out a pack of NOW-OR-LATERS. Terry turns it down.
She takes one for herself.

                     INES (CONT'D)
           Heard you fell. Let me see?

Terry pokes out his scabbing lip.

             INES (CONT'D)                     TERRY
It hurt?                        Uh uh --

                     INES (CONT'D)
           You could’ve died doing something
           like that...

Terry shrugs, fiddling with action-figures from the bucket of
hospital toys, ignoring a small Teddy bear next to him.

                     INES (CONT'D)
           You look just like my sister.

                     TERRY
           No, I don’t -

                     INES
               (cheesing)
           What, you don’t believe me?
               (digging into purse)
           See look.
                                                           9.


Ines retrieves some photos in her purse, placing them in his
eye line. On top of the pile, the image of a HANDSOME BLACK
MAN (20s) with a scribble “LUCK ‘92” in the corner. She peels
it back, revealing a shot of TWO LITTLE BLACK GIRLS (6,8)
with an ELDERLY COUPLE. Renee’s hair is in it’s natural
state, a trendy style fit for 70s-era little black girls.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          That’s me and Reneé.

                    TERRY
          Why her hair look like that?

                    INES
          It was fly back then.

                    TERRY
          Where she at now?

                     INES
          I don’t know. Can’t find her.
              (then)
          But I found you!

A moment. She looks down at the neglected Teddy bear.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          What’s wrong with the one I gave
          you?

                    TERRY
          It’s corny.

                     INES
              (snatching the Teddy up)
          Well buy ya own damn toys then.
              (then)
          What you like?

                    TERRY
          Power Rangers.

                    INES
          Tell me more about your foster
          mother. You like her?

Terry’s shrug is ambivalent.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          Pro’ly gone now anyway.

She leans into the bed. Terry squints at the pain of his
injury, but keeps playing.
                                                         10.


                    INES (CONT'D)
          They tell you anything about me?

                    TERRY
          That you left me on a corner.

                    INES
          ...Why would they tell you that?
          Why the fuck would they go and tell
          you some shit like that?

A FEMALE NURSE steps in, but stops short when she sees Ines.

                    NURSE
          I’m sorry, I just need to check his
          temperature.

                    INES
              (to Terry)
          Get that outcha head.

                    NURSE
              (harmless, tending to
               Terry)
          I thought visiting hours ended
          early today.

                    INES
          Don’t worry, I’ll be gone soon.


EXT. G’S UNIQUE BEAUTY SALON, BEDFORD STUYVESANT - DAY

GLAMOROUS BLACK WOMEN, depicted in the awning, gaze down at
GEE (late 30s) like guardian hood-angels. The plump salon
owner, doesn’t hide his disdain when Ines arrives.

                    GEE
          Ain’t no damn way you coming back
          up in here.

                    INES
              (stepping forward)
          Why not?

                    GEE
          - Back up! I was wondering why the
          hell you disappeared... Sheet as
          long the sidewalk.

                    INES
              (nonchalant)
          ...What that gotta do with hair?
                                                           11.


He unlocks the gate, pulls it up.

                    GEE
          I’m gonna call the cops.

                    INES
          I want my last two weeks.

Gee moseys in, returning with folded bills she snatches.

                    INES (CONT'D)
              (counting)
          - It’s short five.

                    GEE
              (pulling out more cash)
          It’s a shame, but I’m glad this is
          nothing to you.

                    INES
          Imma keep doing what I been doing.

                    GEE
          Oh yeah, and what’s that?

                      INES
                (finishing)
          Me.


INT. EMERGENCY CARE, HOSPITAL - DAY

Ines sits up on a hospital bed, sizing up her NURSE.

                    NURSE
              (checking temperature)
          About how long did you say the
          pain’s been going on?

                    INES
          All morning.

                    NURSE
              (side-eying)
          Well than it’s probably just a
          stomach ache. Come back tomorrow if
          it doesn’t go away.


INT. HALLWAY, CHILDREN’S WARD - LATER

Ines sneaks through the quiet hallway, stopping when she
lands outside of Terry’s room.
                                                           12.


INT. TERRY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ines sneaks a Blue Power Ranger toy between the sheets. His
chest continues to rise and fall without a stir.


INT. TERRY’S HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER

Ines, on a bench at the opposite end of the hall, observes
Terry’s examination by a DOCTOR.

When he sees her, she waves.

Terry allows the doctor to check his ears with an otoscope.
And then... discreetly... he wiggles a few fingers back.

Ines smiles.


INT. TERRY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Terry is back in his street clothes watching cartoons next to
half eaten breakfast. He’s rocking less bandages now.

A few rhythmic knocks. Ines is at the door with a Red Power
Ranger toy in hand.

                    INES
          Look what I got.


INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER

Terry and Ines on a corridor bench. He knocks his action
figure into hers, knocking it down to the floor.

                    INES
          Wow, really?
              (picking up the toy)
          Who’s this one again, Tommy?

                     TERRY
              (nods)
          We going again.

                    INES
          In a sec. Wanna split this?

                    TERRY
          Yeah.

Ines shares some of her Kit Kat with him. He takes a few
bites then goes back to the toys. Ines observes preoccupied
doctors and nurses scurry by.
                                                        13.


EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Ines holds hands with Terry, strolling.

                    INES
          T, um... I think they gon’ move you
          again. In case you don’t see me for
          awhile, I wanted to come say bye.

                    TERRY
          ...To where?

                      INES
          Your   case worker won’t tell me. But
          I’ll   see you soon, okay? I’ll find
          you.   However many times you move...
          I’ll   be right behind.

                    TERRY
          Why can’t I go with you?

                    INES
          It’s not that simple.

They reach the doorway to his room.

                    INES (CONT'D)
              (releasing his hand)
          I’ll see you soon, a’right? Chin
          up.

He leans his wait against the wall, struggling to hold on to
whatever he’s bottling up.

                    TERRY
          ...Why you keep leaving me?

                    INES
          You think this don’t bother me
          too?!

Seeing the doubt on his face, Ines gets down on a knee, eye
to eye with him. Terry allows her to embrace him.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          It’s not me, I promise. These
          people don’t a give a fuck without
          a check.

She studies the foot traffic in corridor. Then, she spots it -
the EMERGENCY EXIT a few yards the opposite way.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          What time ya case worker get here?
                                                          14.


                    TERRY
          I don’t know.

                    INES
          Would it make you feel better if
          you came to stay with me, just for
          a few days?

Terry nods yes.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          ...No harm in that.


EXT. STREET CURB - LATER

Terry’s eyes travel among the PEDESTRIANS moving about, then
up Ines. She’s paralyzed in fear.

                    FEMALE PEDESTRIAN
              (to Terry)
          Hey, don’t you leave that there!

He flinches as Ines spots the discarded juice box.

                    INES
          He’ll do whatever the fuck he
          wants!

      FEMALE PEDESTRIAN                        INES (CONT'D)
It’s exactly why this city’s    So what -
going down -

                    INES (CONT'D)
          He’s bringing up the economy,
          bitch! How many jobs you create
          today?

The lady keeps it moving. Ines kneels down to Terry who’s
visibly shaken.

                    INES (CONT'D)
              (tossing trash)
          Don’t let nobody push you around
          like that again. Hear me?

                    TERRY
          Yes.

Terry forces a brave face as Ines drapes him in her
windbreaker, adjusting it to look less silly. TERRY’S POV as
Ines reveals a reassuring, magical, smile.
                                                          15.


She yanks Terry’s hand, weaving between paused traffic until
they reach a BLACK GYPSY CAB.


INT. BLACK GYPSY CAB - CONTINUOUS

She ushers Terry in.

                      INES
                (slams the door)
          Go.

The CABBIE (40s) peeks over his shoulder.

                       CABBIE
          Go where?

                    INES
          LES, please.

HORN!

                    CABBIE
              (to SQUEEGEE MAN)
          Get the fuck outta here!
              (back to Ines)
          I’m not going to Manhattan -

                    INES
          - We’re already in here!

Terry grips the seat as the car jolts a few feet forward.

             INES (CONT'D)                     CABBIE
They’re chasing us!                Who’s chasin? I don’t want
                                   any trouble -

                    INES (CONT'D)
              (over him)
          I don’t know, just go! Go! Go!

The Cabbie presses the gas. The SQUEEGEE MAN backs off.

                    CABBIE
          The bridge is closed.

                    INES
          - That’s fine, take tunnel.

He complains under his breath, turning the radio up as Ines
rummages through her bag for loose cash. She sneaks a look at
Terry who’s slumped against his window.
                                                           16.


                    INES (CONT'D)
          You sad to leave Brooklyn?

Terry nods, no... Collecting enough to cover the fare, Ines
exhales and rolls her window down.

                                                   LATER:

Then Terry sees them for the first time... the skyscrapers
that define the city’s center. He listens to the SOUNDS OF
MANHATTAN; the boisterous noise has its own melody.

Street scenes passing Ines’ window BLEND TOGETHER IN A DASH
OF COLORS, as if moving at the speed of a subway car.

                    TERRY
          They touch the clouds?

Ines leans over to see his view.

                    INES
          Almost.

                    TERRY
          Can we see all of it?

                    INES
          All of what, the city?

Terry nods again, yes.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          Maybe one day, we can try.


INT. EVERYBODYHOUSE, LOWER EAST SIDE - LATER

Ines storms inside, but Terry’s slow to follow. TERRY’S POV
scanning his mother’s home for the first time - a lived in,
but dilapidated building.


INT. EVERYBODYHOUSE, LOWER EAST SIDE - LATER

Terry appreciates the effortless CADENCE flowing through
Ines’ movements about the kitchen.

                    TERRY
          This is all of it?

                    INES
          All of what?
                                                           17.


                    TERRY
          Where you live.

                    INES
          Got somewhere better in mind?

She passes the small television perched on top of the fridge.
ON THE SCREEN, we see a news story begins with an overhead,
pixelated, SECURITY CAMERA SHOT of Terry and Ines shuffling
down the hospital hall and through the emergency exit.

                    NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
          A six-year old boy snatched...
          Brookdale, one of the city’s most
          troubled and underfunded hospitals,
          reports that the child was spending
          his last morning in patient care.

A horribly inaccurate, unflattering sketch of Ines.

             INES                     NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
   (vainly dismayed)            Authorities are still working
Uh uh!                          to identify the young woman
                                who was likely an estranged
                                family member...

A dark, ultra-blurry photo of Terry amongst other kids at a
party flashes on screen. You can barely tell it’s him.

                    NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
          NYPD is asking anyone with
          information to please call Crime
          Stoppers at 800-577...

                    INES
          You mind staying a bit longer?

                       TERRY
          Uh-Uh.

                       INES
          ...Good.

Ines turns the volume down as the NEWS ANCHOR appears on
screen, beginning another segment.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          What you wanna eat, boo?

                    TERRY
          Cap’n Crunch.
                                                        18.


                    INES
          I don’t have Captain Crunch. How
          ‘bout cinnamon waffles?

Terry’s still glued to the muted TV screen. Ines brashly
switches it off, pulling a box of waffles out the freezer.

                    TERRY
          We gonna get in trouble?

                    INES
          When I was your age, I ran away all
          the time. All they do is check the
          neighborhood, subways and
          schools... Not one foot is coming
          over that bridge.

She slides two sets of waffles into the toaster. She settles
next to him while it cooks.

                      INES (CONT'D)
          You hear?

                      TERRY
          Mhm.

SOUND: Heavy feet speeding down the staircase.

In pops RUDY (30), a local jack-of-all-seedy-trades who owns
the place. He halts in his tracks, startled to see the kid.

                      INES
          Hey Rudy.

                    RUDY
          Who’s this?

                      INES
          My baby.

He nods, not fully at ease, but moving on the fridge. TING!
from the toaster. Ines gets up again. She lays the plated
cinnamon waffles out on the table, then pulling a carton of
Cookies ‘n Cream from the freezer.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          You want ice cream with yours?

                      TERRY
          Yeah -
                                                          19.


EXT. LIVING ROOM, EVERYBODYHOUSE - LATER

THREE TEEN STREET KIDS, presumably homeless, skate and horse
play between the sidewalk and curb. They ignore an ADDICT
(20s) sprawled out on the stoop, leaning.


INT. LIVING ROOM, EVERYBODYHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Rudy leans his weight against a chair, half looking out
front, half keeping eyes on Terry and Ines. Ines sits on top
of an old cabinet across from him, smoking.

Terry’s curled up on the couch. He follows Rudy’s cadence as
he eases back up, locking troubled eyes with the child.

                    RUDY
              (to Ines)
          How you figure the cops not on you?

Ines taps ash into a tray. Terry marvels at DAVITA (29,
Transgender) strutting in.

                    INES
          They don’t know where I live.

                    RUDY
              (thinks)
          ...You’re never gonna make it.

            DAVITA                           INES
Now why would you go and say    Why would you say that?
something like that -

                    RUDY
          - Look at me, look how much of a
          fuck I give.

Blank face.

                    RUDY (CONT'D)
          Vita, you not from here, stay out
          of it -

                    INES
          I need any advice from petty drug
          lords I’ll let you know -

                    RUDY
          LES is dead. Whole city’s ‘bout to
          be dead. They even cleanin’ up
          42nd.
                                                        20.


                    DAVITA
              (sensing Ines’ concern)
          Baby, I’m fine. You know Disney’s
          just dying to have me in one of
          their little shows...

                    INES
          It’s always changing...

Passing Davita, Rudy casually kisses her. Terry’s back
stiffens at the sight. Meanwhile, the front flies open as two
of the street kids dash for the stairs.

                    RUDY
              (whistles)
          Aye! Keep it outside -

                    STREET KID #2
              (halting, CHASE continues)
          Chase needs his headphones.

                    INES
              (to Terry)
          You okay, Little bit?

                       TERRY
                 (shrinking)
          Yes.

                    DAVITA
          Shit like a grown man as small as
          you are. Ines, what you feed him?

                    INES
          Just breakfast.

Davita raises a brow.

                    RUDY
              (taps the glass)
          Tell him to take it over there!

                    STREET KID #1
              (muffled through glass)
          He’s not moving!

                    RUDY
          What you mean he’s not mov -

Rudy bolts to the front door, leaning out just enough kick
the man. He’s gone limp.

                       RUDY (CONT'D)
          Fuck!
                                                        21.


            DAVITA                           RUDY (CONT'D)
What happened?                     (to street kids)
                                Give him the fuck outta here!

                    RUDY (CONT'D)
          I got a dead man on my stoop and
          Etan Patz over here -

                    INES
          A’right, that’s enough!

Davita sucks her teeth leaving the room.

                    STREET KID #2
          What we supposed to do?

                    RUDY
          Dump him around the corner, I don’t
          give a fuck. Last thing I need’s
          the fucking cops showin’ up.

The teens do their best to pick up the body. Rudy lets the
screen slam behind him, sitting back down but unable to keep
still as he rubs his eyes.

                    RUDY (CONT'D)
              (to Ines)
          I don’t know if I can deal with
          this.

                     INES
          You can.

                    RUDY
          No, no, this is too hot. This too
          hot, for me.

                    INES
          ...We’ll buy some more fans -

                    RUDY
          - You know what the fuck I mean.

                    DAVITA
              (returns, to Terry)
          Take some of this.

                     TERRY
              (hesitant, low)
          Thank you.

With Davita’s help, Terry ingests Tylenol with water.
                                                        22.

          Little baby had a tummy ache.

                    INES
              (to Terry)
          ...Why ain’t you speak up?

                    DAVITA
          Shy... Ha! Look at that.

Everyone’s attention diverts to the middle of the street. The
addict shakes himself away from the young men’s clutches,
walking away as if nothing ever happened.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, LOWER EAST SIDE - DAY

Ines and Terry stroll towards Rudy’s with bodega goods in
hand. He’s masked by a cheap firefighter hat and toy
sunglasses. He pulls the eyewear down some, examining the
diverse blend of neighbors sprinkle the sidewalk - immigrant,
hipster and a few yuppie-types.

                    INES
              (snatching snack)
          Gimme that.

She hands him a bottle of orange juice.

                    TERRY
          Who lived there before y’all?

                    INES
              (shrugs)
          Bunch of hippies.

                    TERRY
          And before them?

                    INES
              (playful)
          Probably some immigrants. Before
          that... an aristocrat...

                    TERRY
          Rudy and Davita’s two niggas?

                    INES
          Where do you get off cursin’?

                    TERRY
          You curse -
                                                          23.


                       INES
             So what if they are? It’s enough
             room here for everybody.

Terry takes this in.


EXT. EVERYBODYHOUSE, LOWER EAST SIDE - LATER

Ines pulls the door but it’s locked. She hits the buzzer
about dozen times in a row. Three stories above, the street
kid CHASE pops his head out the window.

                       CHASE
                 (yelling)
             Rudy said don’t let you in.

                       INES
             When he said that?

                       CHASE
             Just now before he left.

                       INES
                 (yelling)
             Unlock the door.

He disappears.

                       INES (CONT'D)
             I’m not playing you piece of shit!
                 (banging the screen door)
             I can do this all day!

              TERRY                            INES (CONT'D)
I’m hot...                        Davita, you in there?!

Terry listens to her bang on the door again. He perches on
the steps, closing his eyes. She’s still banging as Rudy’s
head pops out.

                       RUDY
             Vita’s not here.
                 (to Terry)
             Anybody ever say ya mother’s a
             dangerous woman?

                       INES
             Come downstairs so he can hear that
             better -

                       RUDY
             I’m not playin’ ya little games.
                                                           24.


             INES                              RUDY (CONT'D)
I should call the cops and      - AYE!
report a few faggots --

                    INES (CONT'D)
          - squatting on Delancey! We hustled
          together but now they acting
          shiesty!

Rudy retrieves a garbage bag from Chase, then letting it
plummet down to the sidewalk.

                    RUDY
          Go to a shelter.

Ines, momentarily stunned, watches him disappear for good.

                    INES
          All the times that I had your back?

Terry’s sweaty, sleepy head droops from the fist it leans on.
Relenting, Ines nudges him before heatstroke sets in.

                    INES (CONT'D)
              (unbothered, leaving)
          Whatever, let’s go.


EXT. COMMERCIAL STREET, LOWER EAST SIDE - LATER

Ines purchases a gang of papers from a STREET VENDOR.


INT. $1 PIZZA SHOP - LATER

                    INES
          Look how big this man’s head is.

Terry, seated across from her, peeps a front cover image of
Mayor Giuliani.

                    INES (CONT'D)
              (flipping)
          He wants to turn New York into the
          suburbs. Good luck with that.

He has no idea what the fuck she’s talking about. Pouted chin
over crossed arms, Terry watches Ines checks news stories
inside each paper, one by one. No mention of them. She sneaks
a quick glance across the restaurant.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          That couple over there’s on a first
          date. Won’t last for long though.
                                                          25.


                    TERRY
          How you know?

                    INES
          He doesn’t like her. I can tell
          from his eyes.

Terry observes THE SEEDY MAN’S fast talk and consistent
glances towards HIS LADY FRIEND’S purse.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          How’s the pizza?

                      TERRY
          Good.

She keeps flipping.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          Where’s my dad at?

She looks up from the page.

                    INES
          He’s gone. But you wouldn’t nuh
          liked him anyway. I have someone
          else in mind.

She flips another page.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          You miss your old friends?

                    TERRY
          They not my friends.

                    INES
          Yeah, I’m starting to feel like I
          don’t have any friends either.
          Except you.


EXT. PAYPHONE BOOTH, LES STREET CORNER - LATER

Ines towers over Terry, covering his little body from being
seen while he huddles into the booth. Leaning in to make a
call, she keeps an eye on their surroundings.

                    TERRY
          How much longer?

Ines keeps her head to the receiver.
                                                         26.


                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          How much longer?

Still no response from Ines.

                       TERRY (CONT'D)
          How much -

                    INES
          Give me a minute!

She slams the phone down, pulling out another quarter.

                    TERRY
              (after barely a minute)
          We gon’ sleep out here?

His mother’s eyes shift down, piercing into him.

                    INES
          You want to?

                       TERRY
          No -

                    INES
          - So shut the fuck up and let me
          finish!

Terry’s face crumples.

                    INES (CONT'D)
              (pulling him out)
          You wanna cry? Fine, go back to
          Brooklyn.

Terry drags his feet.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          I’ll call ya social workers right
          now! Since everyone else knows
          better -

                    TERRY
              (whimpering)
          I don’t want to!

                    INES
          So what do you want to do, cause
          I’m tired of this!

                    TERRY
          I wanna stay with you!
                                                        27.


Ines thinks for a moment to herself.

                    INES
          Listen, I’m sorry I cursed -
              (grabbing his jaw)
          Look at me! I’m sorry.

He nods forgivingly.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          You wanna find a new home?

                       TERRY
          Yes...

                    INES
          I’ll go to war for you, understand
          that? Against anybody, but I need
          to know we’re in this thing
          together. Tell me!

                    TERRY
              (mumbly)
          We’re in this together...

Ines rises, referencing her old beeper to find a new number.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          What’s “war”?

                    INES
              (dialing)
          Something you do to protect the
          ones you love.


EXT. LES STREET CORNER - LATER THAT NIGHT

Terry’s leaning on the bag as a DOUBLE HONK wakes him up.
KIMBERLY JONES (22, Black) rolls her car window down.

                    KIM
              (yelling)
          You better hop in, cause I’m not
          stopping!

Ines gets up, ushering a drowsy Terry to do the same. Kim
slows the vehicle down some, but it’s still in motion as they
chase from the curb.

                    INES
          Bitch, stop the car! You see me
          with this bag!
                                                        28.


                    KIM
              (yelling)
          Not around here, hell the fuck no!

Ines yanks the back passenger door open as her friend finally
rests the engine.

                    KIM (CONT'D)
          I’on understand why you couldn’t
          hop on the train... Oh, who’s
          this?!

                    INES
          My son, Terry.

                    KIM
          You have a son now? Wow, he’s big!

                    INES
          Terry, this is Kim.

Kim flirts with a finger wave.

                    KIM
           Cute lil’ thing.


EXT. JONES HOUSE, HARLEM - LATER

A predominantly black neighborhood, made apparent by the
SPRINKLES OF LITTER AND PEOPLE outside. Ines slams the car
door behind her, opening the back for Terry. Kim wastes no
time racing up the steps.


INT. KITCHEN, JONES HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Kim steps into the kitchen as her mother, MS. JONES (late
40s, Black), stirs a late night cup of tea. This is an
educated, poised woman.

                    MS. JONES
          Is that Ghetto Ines in my living
          room?

                    KIM
          She needs a place to stay.

                    MS. JONES
          When you start hangin’ with her
          again?
                                                          29.


                    KIM
              (low)
          Shh! She’s with her son. Please,
          don’t say anything.

                    MS. JONES
          For how long?

                    KIM
          I don’t know, a couple of weeks?

Ms. Jones laughs in disbelief.

                    KIM (CONT'D)
          Wanna come say hi?

                    MS. JONES
              (leaving)
          I’m tired. We’ll deal with this
          tomorrow.


INT. LIVING ROOM, JONES HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Ines and Terry are patiently seated as Kim returns with
pillows and sheets for the sofa.

                    KIM
          He can sleep in my room.


INT. KITCHEN, JONES HOUSE - MORNING

Sifting through mail, Ms. Jones watches NY1’s “NY MINUTE”
REPORT on her countertop TV. The REPORTER discusses economic
recovery and a failed follow up to the 1993 WTC BOMBING.

She peers over at Terry in the opposite room.


INT. LIVING ROOM, JONES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Terry sulks on the couch watching cartoons.

                    KIM (O.S.)
          You get your GED?


INT. KIM’S BEDROOM, JONES HOUSE - SAME TIME

Kim and Ines, still in sleepwear. She’s already found her way
through Kim’s hair products - finishing a new look.
                                                   30.


                          INES
                 (nods)
             Inside.

                       KIM
             Really, that’s fly!

                       INES
             You get hype over the weirdest
             things -

                       KIM
             - So what’s your plan, you up here
             for good?

                       INES
                 (shrugs)
             I’m over these catty ass shops.

                       KIM
             Start your own -

                       INES
             With who’s money? What am I suppose
             to do to right now? Me and my son
             need something to eat right now.

                       KIM
                 (silence, then)
             I’ve been meaning to ask you about
             Terry. You have him with...

Ines nods.

                       KIM (CONT'D)
             He still locked up?

                       INES
             ‘bout a year left, I think.

                       KIM
             Then who’s his...

Ines looks away.

                       INES
             The city had him. He’s not supposed
             be with me.

                       KIM
             Can’t you get locked up for
             something like that?
                                                        31.


                    INES
          Not if you keep it to yourself.

                    KIM
          ...It’s safe with me.


INT. KITCHEN, JONES HOUSE - LATER THAT MORNING

Ines, refreshed in street clothes after days of distress.
She’s sprawled her limbs along a chair closest to the fan.
Kim holds Terry on her knee, overlooking a coloring book.

                    KIM
          Look at the cute little elephants.

                    TERRY
          They look dumb.

                    KIM
          No they don’t, stop -

Ms. Jones, over the stove sizzling breakfast, watches Ines.

                    MS. JONES
          Are you working?

                    INES
          I’m going job huntin’ today.

                    MS. JONES
          What you plannin’ to wear to
          interviews? You can’t go into
          anybody’s business lookin’ and
          talkin’ like that.

                    INES
          Why’s that?

                    KIM
          She can borrow my stuff.

                    INES
          ...Not ‘white’ enough for you?

Ms. Jones rolls her eyes. Ines takes this in.

                    MS. JONES
              (not hearing)
          All that yakkin’ just makes me
          cringe.

Ines takes this in too.
                                                        32.


                    MS. JONES (CONT'D)
          I tell my girls the same thing.

                       KIM
                 (to Terry)
          Eat.

                    INES
          Never mind where you’re from, as
          long as you don’t remind anybody
          they left you there.

She storms off.

                       KIM
          Ines!

                    MS. JONES
          Now where is she going?


INT. BODEGA SERVICE WINDOW, HARLEM - LATER

Ines knocks the glass.

                    INES
          Let me get a Loosie and big burst.
          And nacho cheese sunflower seeds...

The BODEGA CLERK slides the cigarette through. Meanwhile,
Ines eyes the small TV stationed behind the counter.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          They still talking about the kid
          snatched in Brooklyn?

                    BODEGA CLERK
          I dunno that story.

                    INES
              (thinks, then)
          Can you add a newspaper?


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, HARLEM - MOMENTS LATER

Ines’ runs her fingers over the TOP NEW STORIES OF THE DAY.
Terry’s nowhere in the midst.

She scans the street of MOM-N-POP SHOPS from her post on the
fire hydrant, mind traveling elsewhere.
                                                        33.


INT. LIVING ROOM, JONES HOUSE - LATER

Kim surfs the dials of the TV.

                    KIM
          Okay, which show you like?

Terry’s eyes float across the room, picking up the comforts
of middle class furniture, artwork, family photographs...

                    MS. JONES
              (entering, over ringing
               phone)
          He still not talking?

                       KIM
          No.
              (picking up call)
          Jones’ residence.

                                                INTERCUT:

Ines flips to a flyer’s backside, propping it up on her knee.

                    INES
              (into the phone)
          Don’t let Terry out of your sight.

                       KIM
          What?

Ines doodles her face, along with the handwritten words “HAIR
BY INES BEEPER # (212) 455...”

                    INES
          Keep him in the house.

                    KIM
          Ines, where are you?

                    INES
          Just do it, please?

                    KIM
          ...Of course.

She bangs the phone.

                    MS. JONES
          She say where she was at?

                    KIM
          Uh uh. You like games, Terry?
                                                           34.


Ms. Jones exhales, but turning to Terry she calms again.

                    MS. JONES
          In this house we express ourselves.

He’s tucked his face into the neck of his shirt. She gently
pulls the collar down.

                    MS. JONES (CONT'D)
          Who’s hiding in there?


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, HARLEM - DAY

Ines moves into the road, rage channeled into astute focus. A
car filled with TWO 30-SOMETHING YEAR OLD WOMEN rolls up.

                       INES
          Excuse me!

She sticks a flyer into the window.

                     LADY IN CAR
          You do extensions? I wanna take
          this french roll out and put some
          length in.

                    INES
          I do everything. You come by my
          place or I’ll go to yours.

                       LADY IN CAR
          Okay -

                    INES
          How much the Africans charge you?

                       LADY IN CAR
          $150 -

                    INES
          I’ll do it for $75 -

                    LADY IN CAR
          Okay, okay!


INT. FRONT ENTRANCE, JONES HOUSE - LATER THAT EVENING

Kim opens the front door for Ines.

                    INES
          I bought him some clothes.
                                                        35.


Kim sighs, letting her pass.


INT. LIVING ROOM, JONES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Terry, on the ground surrounded by old board games, perks up
at the sight of Ines. She drops shopping bags at his feet.

Kim glances at her mother. Ms. Jones glances at the clock.

                    INES
              (to Terry)
          See if those fit you.

Terry opens the sneaker box.

                    KIM
          You like ‘em?

                    TERRY
          They too big.

                    INES
          You’ll grow into them.

                    MS. JONES
              (to Terry)
          Why don’t you take those upstairs.

He complies. Ines mouths “Thank You” to Kim. Kim blows an air
kiss as she leaves for the kitchen. Ines waits for Ms. Jones
to say something first. She doesn’t.

                    INES
          Your day going well, Jonesy?

No response.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          I said how’s your -

                    MS. JONES
              (flipping through mail)
          It’s fine, Ines. Kim, check the
          stove for me please?

                    KIM (O.S.)
          Okay.

After a fit of silence.

                    INES
          You can at least act like you see
          me here -
                                                          36.


INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING, JONES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Terry slumps against the wall, eavesdropping.


INT. LIVING ROOM, JONES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                    MS. JONES
          Exactly what kind of response do
          you want? Strolling in here after
          hours of being God-knows-where -

             INES                         MS. JONES (CONT'D)
I checked in earlier -          - like some kind of street
                                walker!

                    INES (CONT'D)
          The fuck did you just call me?

                    KIM
              (re-entering)
          Oh shit -

                    INES
          Run that to me one more time.
          Whatever you think of me just spit
          it out!

                    MS. JONES
              (locking eyes,
               condescending)
          I don’t think anything of you...

Just as Ms. Jones turns away, Ines shoves her, causing the
older woman to stumble, nearly tumbling to the floor.
Regaining composure, she looks to Ines in bewilderment.

                    KIM
          Ines, whassup with you?

                KIM (CONT'D)              MS. JONES
   (reaching)                   - Get off me, I’m good. You
Ma -                            call that being a mother?

Ines retreats to the couch, curling into herself like a
failure.

                    MS. JONES (CONT'D)
          The hell are you teaching that
          little boy up there?
                                                        37.


EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET, HARLEM - DAY

Ines and Kim are squared off outside of her car.

                    KIM
          So that’s it, you got nothing to
          say?

                    INES
          I said I was sorry -

                     KIM
          - To me!

                    INES
          Was I wrong? Yes, what else you
          want me to say?

Kim rolls her eyes to keep cool.

                    KIM
          Can’t keep fightin’ everyone you
          disagree with. We gotta grow up!

                    INES
          She’s never gonna like me
          regardless. That’s why all she’s
          ever done is attack my fucking
          spirit -

                    KIM
          - My mom’s gonna be who she’s gonna
          be. But like -

                    INES
          - But what?

                    KIM
          When are you going to realize that
          you’re enough? Who cares what she
          says, why even let any of that get
          to you?

                    INES
          She called me a bad mother...

                     KIM
              (embracing her)
          Come ‘ere.

Fragile in her friend’s arms, Ines is less eager to let go.

                    KIM (CONT'D)
          She forgets you don’t have one.
                                                           38.


Kim bends down, knocking on the backseat window. INES POV
through the glass, on Terry.

                    KIM (CONT'D)
          And you!
              (his face is stone)
          Get that chip off your shoulder. I
          know you hear me!

Kim opens the car door for him. Ines grabs their belongings
from the trunk, observing the change in Terry’s demeanor.


EXT. STOREFRONT & RESIDENTIAL BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

A RESIDENT steps out just in time for Ines to catch the door.
She waves bye to Kim, letting Terry step inside first.


INT. LOBBY, STOREFRONT & RESIDENTIAL BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Terry heads for the stairwell.

                    INES
          T, come back. We’re not going up.

Ines watches Kim drive off.

                    INES (CONT'D)
              (to Terry)
          Don’t look at me like that.

She tries to touch his head affectionately, but he pulls
away. A few tears have swollen into Terry’s eyes.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          Why you being mean to me?

                    TERRY
          Cause you keep fucking up!

She pops him right on the mouth.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          Ow!

                     INES
          Stop thinkin’ you can talk to me
          like that!

                    TERRY
          I liked them.
                                                        39.


                    INES
          Some stuff’s more important than
          coloring books.

Ines yanks a YELLOW BOOK out of the bag.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          Stay right here.


EXT. PAYPHONE, COMMERCIAL STREET - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE UP on her barely still functioning Beeper.

Ines keeps hawk eyes on the building, dialing up someone.


INT. LOBBY, STOREFRONT & RESIDENTIAL BUILDING - MEANWHILE

Through the glass, Terry spots two BEAT COPS exiting a shop.


EXT. STOREFRONT & RESIDENTIAL BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Terry creeps outside, leaning against the door front.

                    INES (O.S.)
          Pick up, pick up, pick up...


EXT. COMMERCIAL STREET - CONTINUOUS

Ines slams the phone down in defeat. She thinks hard. Opening
the Yellow Pages, Ines runs her index finger down a list of
traditional American last names. She stops at DIAZ, CYNTHIA.

                     INES
              (on the phone)
          Hi’s this Cynthia?
              (then)
          It’s your niece, Ines. My father
          never got a chance to reconnect but
          how are you, Mami?

She spots Terry, waving for him to go back inside.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          Good, listen I need a favor. The
          building I’m living in got
          asbestos. Yeah - they cleared
          everybody out, all the tenants.

Terry creeps down the sidewalk in the opposite direction.
                                                         40.


                    INES (CONT'D)
              (louder)
          You gonna be home for little while?
              (then, louder)
          Huh? I can’t hear you? Why don’t I
          just come by and we’ll talk in
          person. What’s your address?
              (muffling receiver)
          Terry!
              (back to the phone)
          I’ll be there in thirty minutes.

Ines snatches Terry up, just a few feet from the curb.

              TERRY                         INES (CONT'D)
Get off me!                     Where were you going?!

                    INES (CONT'D)
          All our STUFF was in there!

Terry doesn’t respond, doesn’t look at her at all. Then, Ines
peeps the unknowing officers for herself. They keep moving.


INT. CYNTHIA’S APARTMENT, 112TH STREET BROWNSTONE - LATER

CYNTHIA DIAZ (65, Dominican) lets them in. Telenovelas play
on the TV off-screen. Ines steps in with Terry sneaking a
look around.

                    INES
          Hey Tia. It’s just you?

                     CYNTHIA
              (heavy accent)
          You black?

                    INES
          Yeah, and so are you...

Cynthia takes a good, better, look at Ines. Retreating to her
little table, but doesn’t sit down.

                    CYNTHIA
          ...You don’t tell me you had a
          baby.

                     INES
          He’s six.
              (then)
          It’s nice to see you after all this
          time. My bad for the short notice.

She nudges Terry towards the couch.
                                                         41.


                    INES (CONT'D)
          We need a place to stay. Just a
          couple of nights.

                    CYNTHIA
          ...I understand...


INT. LIVING ROOM, CYNTHIA’S APARTMENT - DAY

Terry’s wrapped in his mother’s arms, both fast asleep on the
sofa. Cynthia appears from the hallway.

                    CYNTHIA
              (tapping Ines, waking her)
          Sweetheart, I need milk...

She rests a few dollar bills on the couch.


INT. HALLWAY, PARLOR LEVEL, 112TH STREET BROWNSTONE - DAY

Ines hits the bottom of the steps, opening the front door.
MISS ANNIE (60s), the landlord and resident living on the
building’s lower levels is a few feet away in the next room.

                      MISS ANNIE (O.S.)
          Ah, ah, -

                      INES
          What?


INT. LIVING ROOM, 112TH STREET BROWNSTONE - CONTINUOUS

                    MISS ANNIE
          Sit your ass down. Right there.

Ines creeps in.

                    MISS ANNIE (CONT'D)
          You mind telling me what the hell’s
          going on?

                    INES
          Nothing’s going on -

                    MISS ANNIE
          - Lady in 4R says you tryna run
          game.

                    INES
          I’m her niece -
                                                          42.


                        MISS ANNIE
             - She don’t know who the fuck you
             are! Poor thing too scared of
             gettin’ stabbed or beat up.
                 (then)
             If it wasn’t for the little boy
             first thing I’d done is call the
             cops. But I’m gonna let you explain
             yourself, so talk.

                       INES
             ...we had nowhere else to go.

                       MISS ANNIE
             How long you been on the street?

                       INES
             Not long. A situation didn’t
             work out.

                       MISS ANNIE
             And common sense said to swindle
             some stranger... Where your people?

                       INES
             Gone.

                       MISS ANNIE
             Gone where?...You from up here?

Ines nods.

          MISS ANNIE (CONT'D)                  INES
Go ‘head speak up -               - It got ‘em.

                       INES (CONT'D)
             Crack took my family, but I’ve
             happily moved on. Miss, I apologize
             for the trouble, but we’ll leave.

Miss Annie goes perceptively quiet.

                        MISS ANNIE
             ...You and the rest of us.
                  (rising)
             Pea!

Her grandson, PEA (6) scurries in. Ines remains frozen.

                       PEA
             Yes?
                                                         43.


                    MISS ANNIE
          Clear your things out of Sadie’s
          old room.
              (to Ines)
          I have a spare room in the back.
          Less awkward than staying upstairs.
          Rent goes to me. Try anything I
          keep a .44 ready -


INT. LIVING ROOM, HAIR CUSTOMER’S APARTMENT - DAY

CUSTOMER 1 models a fresh hairdo in the mirror.

                    CUSTOMER 1
              (opening her purse)
          You’re really talented.

                    INES
              (packing up)
          It’s nothing.

                    CUSTOMER 1
          Does that mean I don’t have to pay
          you then?

She hands Ines the cash anyway.

                    CUSTOMER 1 (CONT'D)
              (still in mirror)
          Well, I feel like something.

Ines places the cash, a small amount, into her pocket.


INT. MISS ANNIE’S SPARE ROOM - DAY

Ines blast tunes from the radio, playfully bopping as she
pulls a fresh Tee over his head.

                    INES
          What’s wrong?

                    TERRY
          Nothing. I like seeing you happy.

She smiles - he’s her friend again.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          Why Miss Annie always mad?

                    INES
          Too many hairs creeping up to her
          chin.
                                                           44.


INT. LIVING ROOM, 112TH STREET BROWNSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Annie fixes family photos along the wall. Pea babbles to
Terry, explaining how to play the video game. Ines drops the
envelope with rent on the table, but sticks around.

                       MISS ANNIE
             Leave it right there.

Annie wipes down an aged portrait of her DAUGHTER.

                       INES
             You ever see her?

                        MISS ANNIE
             Who, Keisha? She’s cleaned up a few
             times.
                 (glancing at Pea)
             That’s a battle I can’t fight.
             She’ll come home for good when
             she’s ready.
                 (then)
             No one call you yet?

                       INES
             I found a job.

                       MISS ANNIE
             Oh yeah, where at?

                       INES
             Jamaica Hospital. A lab clerk.

                          MISS ANNIE
             In Queens?

Ines nods.

                       MISS ANNIE (CONT'D)
             That’s what, two hours on the
             train? If you don’t care... do what
             you have to do. Can’t waste any
             time feeling sorry for yourself.

She hangs the frame with Keisha back up.


EXT. 111TH ST. APARTMENT BUILDING, HARLEM - DAY

CHYRON - EIGHT MONTHS LATER

Ines beams with glee as Kim moseys over to the entrance,
Terry hoisted on her back. Kim drops the boy down to the
sidewalk. Two moving boxes rest at his mother’s feet.
                                                        45.


                    KIM
          Aw, well look at you...

Ines opens the door, lavishing in the compliment.

                    KIM (CONT'D)
          Terry what books did we read today?


INT. TERRY’S BEDROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER

Terry hops around on his new bed.

                    KIM (O.S.)
          The dash is missing.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Kim points to the tattered apartment number, swiping up a
moving box that held the door open.

                       INES
                 (unpacking)
          Huh?

Instead of 10-01 the sign reads 10 01 Ines waves it away.

                    KIM
          How much they charging?

                    INES
          Four-fifty a month.

                    KIM
          You did good, babe.

She joins Ines on the floor.

                    INES
          Let your mother tell it, I can’t
          exist anywhere else, so.

Ines continues sorting.

                    KIM
          ...Harlem still means a lot to a
          lot of people. You know that,
          right?

                    INES
              (dismissive)
          Pass me that?
                                                        46.


Kim rolls her eyes, commencing an awkward silence.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          I stopped doing hair.

                    KIM
          Why?

                    INES
          I’m tired. And it’s too much time
          away from Terry.

                    KIM
          He back in school yet?

                    INES
              (looking away)
          Up the street.

                    KIM
          I started applying too... I’m going
          to Clark Atlanta in the Fall.

                    INES
          You’re leaving us?

                    KIM
              (taken aback)
          I wouldn’t say it like that.

                    INES
              (after a beat)
          I’m happy for you.

                    KIM
          You can go back, too. Even if its
          part time or something like that.

                    INES
          Yeah, someday.


INT. STOOP, INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

Ines exhales the smoke from her cigarette. INES POV on the
broken traffic light at the intersection. It’s completely off
at first, then ticking rhythmically back to yellow every time
it should switch.

INES POV PAN to KIDS ON THE BLOCK playing near the curb. A
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN supervises from a nearby stoop.
                                                        47.


                    NEIGHBORHOOD MAN
              (yelling from car)
          Make sure ya’ll stay out the
          street.

                       MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
          I got ‘em!


INT. INES’ BEDROOM - DAY

Terry watches Ines transform once more. She’s subduing her
hair and makeup, stripping away the “ghetto” blackness. Maybe
Ms. Jones was right after all.

                    TERRY
          How long you gon’ be gone?

                    INES
          I’ll be back this afternoon.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Terry quietly observes the effortless ticks flowing through
Ines’ movement while she prepares to leave, placing on
jacket, sneakers, grabbing her bag... The space is still
bare, aside from a tv and couch.

                    INES
          You got cereal and milk. For lunch
          and dinner there’s left overs in
          the fridge. Just don’t heat it more
          than sixty seconds or you’ll burn
          your mouth. And um... don’t answer
          the door for anyone. If the phone
          rings, wait for the answering
          machine to come on to see if it’s
          me. Okay?

                       TERRY
          Yes.

                     INES
          Don’t pick up for anyone else. My
          number’s on the paper right there
          if you need to reach me at work.
              (then)
          Okay? I said I’m leaving.

                    TERRY
          I heard you.
                                                          48.


                    INES
          I’ll be back around three.

As a last touch, she slides the drapes, leaving all but a
sliver of natural light into the room.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER

Terry creeps into the hallway.

                    TERRY
              (shouting)
          ANYBODY HOME?!

He pulls a toy gun out of his pocket, shooting at an unseen
enemy down the hall.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER - MONTAGE

- Terry pops a cassette into Ines’ boombox.

- Terry hops around on the couch, slightly spilling a plate
of leftovers and listening to music as he watches cartoons.

- No more music as he lies on the floor exhausted, half
watching, then falling asleep to the news.

                                                      LATER:

- Terry wakens. The news is still rolling, but outside we
hear CHILDREN-AT-PLAY. Moving to the window, he observes FOUR
KIDS running around below.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER

SOUND: Keys at the door. Ines emerges from the hallway.

                     INES
          Terry.
              (then)
          Everything good?

                    TERRY
          Why nobody looking for me?

                    INES
          Cause we made it too hard for them.
          That was whole point, remember?

Not sure if Terry buys this, Ines places her things down.
                                                        49.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - DAY

Ines drags a chair through Terry’s mess, across the floor to
the couch, settling face-to-face with Terry.

                    INES
              (gentle)
          I’m everybody else now?

Terry bounces ball, she takes it away.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          I hate when you get this way. Why
          you so scared to open up?

Terry keeps eyes out the window.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          There’s parts you don’t even show
          me.

He’s still despondent, she follows his eyes out the window.

                      INES (CONT'D)
          What you scared everybody’s gonna
          see?
               (then)
          See that tall one over there?
          That’s the Empire State Building.
          “Empire’s’ like our way of saying,
          ‘This is the greatest place in the
          world’. Why you think that is? Why
          you think so many people love it
          here? If they can be anywhere else.
               (no response)
          Aight, look down. You see those two
          tall buildings that look alike?

                    TERRY
          I think so.

                    INES
          That’s the Twin Towers. You see how
          one’s a little shorter. It’s a way
          of saying, we’re all the same, but
          still a little bit different, you
          know?

It’s hard to tell if Terry’s looking or just lost in a daze.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          I loved doing that when I was
          little.
                    (MORE)
                                                        50.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          No matter wherever, if I could make
          ‘em out, felt like I was home.
              (thinks, looks away)
          What happened to me, baby?

                    TERRY
          I don’t know.

Ines rises, going for her Newports.

                     INES
          I don’t know what the fuck I’m
          trying to tell you, T. You don’t
          wanna hear me out, that’s fine.
              (then)
          But there’s more to life than
          fucked up beginnings.


EXT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

A small baseball rests by the curb, near a few broken crack
pipes. Ines retrieves it. She fumbles the pitch. Terry drops
his bat in disgust.

                    TERRY
          You not holding it right!

                    INES
              (cigarette in mouth)
          - Be nice! This new for me, too.

Terry swings the bat, hitting it this time.


INT. INES’ LIVING ROOM - LATER

Terry and Ines on the floor, going head-to-head in a video
game. Sensing she’s losing, Ines snatches his remote, he
fights to get it back.


INT. INES’ BEDROOM - EVENING

Ines wraps an arm around Terry, falling asleep as he finishes
reading a DR.SEUSS BOOK to her. They’re blanketed by
NEIGHBORHOOD VOICES outside.

            TERRY                               INES
What -                              (helping)
                                 - happened.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          Happened then... Well, in Ho-Ville -
                                                        51.


                    INES
          - Who-ville.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - DAY

Terry plays video games. Ines sifts through bills he’s drawn
on. TERRY POV of scattered photos on the coffee table.

                    TERRY
          Who’s that?

Ines picks up the photo, drifting back in time.

                    INES
          ...That’s when I was pregnant.
              (jokingly, puts it down)
          Look at how cute I was back then.
          This body was a playground for a
          thousand niggas until you came
          along!

                    TERRY
          That’s nasty.

The room’s slightly more furnished now. When she opens the
front door, Rudy has his hand out, holding a Manila envelope.

                    INES
              (grabbing the envelope)
          What if we need to go to the
          doctor?

His skin is pale and less healthy. Ines reviews the documents
- a phony birth certificate and other records for Terry.

                    RUDY
              (entering)
          Just show up and say you’re sick.

                    INES
          T, look who it is!

TERRY’S POV as both adults turn his way.

                    TERRY
          ...Hey Rudy.

                    RUDY
          Sup, Little Man?
              (then, to Ines)
          How long’s it been now?
                                                        52.


                     INES
          About a year. They classified it as
          a runaway.

                    RUDY
          No way.

Rudy narrows eyes on Terry in disbelief.

                    RUDY (CONT'D)
          Ines, I ain’t mean no harm to you.
          Just had my own battle to fight.

                    INES
              (rising to walk him out)
          Who loves a lil’ drama more than
          me? Everything works out as it
          should. It was nice to see you.

                    RUDY
              (following)
          Got a lotta new things going -

                    INES
          Yeah?

                    RUDY
          Hot box, numbers, whatever. Hit me
          up.

Ines shuts the door, tossing the envelope down on the table.

                    INES
              (sighs)
          I went with Daryl. Last name,
          Raymond. Daryl Raymond and we moved
          here from Jersey, okay? Terry’s
          your middle name.

Terry’s eyes don’t leave the game. The house phone rings.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          T!

                    TERRY
          I don’t like it.

                     INES
              (picking up the phone)
          - Hey Kim.

Ines moves into the kitchen.
                                                        53.


                    TERRY
              (rumbling to himself)
          Daryl... Raymond...


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - DAY

Terry, in ELEMENTARY SCHOOL UNIFORM, enters the sounds of
ELEVATED VOICES - but things quiet down as he shuts the door.
Sitting at the kitchen table, MARCEL ‘LUCKY’ DIAZ (26) turns
to him - a handsome but scruffy-looking man. He’s the same
man from the photo Ines first showed Terry in the hospital.

                      LUCKY
          That him?

Ines briefly peeks into the hallway, dish and cloth in-hand.

                    INES
              (to Terry)
          Why standing there like you scared?


INT. KITCHEN, INES’ APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Terry makes his way down the hallway, pressing himself into
the kitchen wall opposite of Lucky when he enters.

                     INES
              (to Lucky)
          Lady across the hall walks him home
          for me.
              (then)
          Terry, I want you to meet Lucky.

Terry sizes up this weary-eyed man. It’s clear that a few
years in prison have given his spirit a beating, yet there’s
still a disarming way about him.

                    TERRY
              (faux-tough)
          What’s going on.

                    LUCKY
          What’s up, little man?

                    INES
          Lucky’s gonna be moving in with us.

                    TERRY
          For how long?
                                                        54.


                    LUCKY
              (chuckles)
          He kicking me out already.

Ines laughs too, but Terry’s much less amused.


INT. INES’ BEDROOM - DAY

A HORN sounds from elsewhere outside the window, just as
Lucky thrusts into INES... The release of this lovemaking is
slow, coinciding the cadence of street ambience...

Ines grips him even harder for the second horn, thrust and
release... Despite her enthusiasm, Lucky pulls away
prematurely, leaving her alone on the bed. There’s just not
enough life back in him yet.

                    LUCKY
          Where was he before?

                    INES
              (nonchalant)
          How many times you gon’ ask that?

                    LUCKY
          ‘Til I get an answer.

                    INES
          No one’s even looking for him -

                    LUCKY
          Yeah they not looking for him,
          they’re looking for me! You have
          any picture of what’s going on out
          there? I just got out -

                    INES
              (still composed)
          - How many times I been locked up
          for you?

                    LUCKY
          I’m not going back.

                     INES
          Remember what it was like growing
          up without a father?
              (then)
          I want us to be a family.
                                                           55.


                    LUCKY
              (leaving)
          I wanted you. But you’re fuckin’
          crazy.

                    INES
          Nuts for thinking you would
          understand.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER

Terry creeps into the room. Ines quietly listens to life
outside the window. She doesn’t acknowledge him.

                    TERRY
          You mad at me?

She nods, no.


EXT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING, ENTRANCE - DAY

Ines and Terry, buried in winter coats, carry grocery bags
with zombie-like energy. Just as they reach the steps, the
roar of a motorcycle hits the block.

Showman Lucky, more alive and refreshed, rounds his way
towards the building. He catches Ines’ blushing at the looks
of her NEIGHBORS.


INT. INES’ LIVING ROOM - LATER

Ines keeps an eye on Lucky as she prepares dinner. He’s doing
push-ups nearby.

                     INES
          ...Where’d you stay?
              (then)
          Marcel, where’d you -

                    LUCKY
          - Posted up with Mike.

                    INES
          That bike not hot is it?
              (he nods, no)
          ...I need another can of soup.

                    LUCKY
          After the game.
                                                        56.


                    INES
          I need you to go now. And why don’t
          you take Terry with you?

He shoots her a look.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, HARLEM - MOVING - LATER

Terry and Lucky are side-by-side. It feels more like
eggshells than concrete is paved under them.

                    NEIGHBORHOOD WOMAN
              (passing)
          How you doing, Lucky?

                    LUCKY
          I’m good, Mama. How’s your mother?

Quick glance at her back side.

                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          Do me a favor, walk on this side of
          me.

Lucky gently pushes Terry away from the street curb towards
the inner sidewalk. He can’t stop fidgeting, but in Terry POV
is just another part of naturally RHYTHMIC swagger.

                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          You always this quiet?

                       TERRY
          Sometimes.

                    LUCKY
          What you thinking about?

Terry shrugs.

                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          Sounds like a lot.

Terry musters up some courage...

                    TERRY
          How’d you get the name ‘Lucky’?

                     LUCKY
          Stories for another time.
              (then)
          Made a couple mistakes is all.
                                                        57.


                    TERRY
          ...And I’m a mistake too?

                    LUCKY
          Who told you that?

                    TERRY
          It’s why you don’t want me around.

                     LUCKY
          That’s not true. Yo shake that off.
              (then)
          You’re a blessing. For your mom
          especially. Everything’s just
          complicated.

This time he’s the one sneaking a look at Terry, who’s face
is still dispirited.

                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          Let’s pop in here real quick -


INT. BODEGA - CONTINUOUS

Orderly queues don’t exist here. LONZO (43), the shop owner,
finishes a transaction. HALF A DOZEN OTHER CUSTOMERS flash
purchased items, leaving exact change on the counter.

                    LUCKY
              (whistles)
          Lon-zo! Let me get a pack of
          Newports.

                    LONZO
          Aye Luck, hold on -

                    HERO
          - Look who it is! How long you been
          out?

OFFICER DANIEL “HERO” EVANS (32) and PARTNER are in the back
waiting on sandwiches. Lonzo places the item down but rushes
to the back of the store, leaving Terry and Lucky stuck
waiting for the change.

                    LUCKY
          ...Couple of months.

Hero hands Lonzo a bag of barbecue potato chips to layer on.
Terry moves closer to Lucky’s side, out of the cop’s sight.
                                                        58.


             HERO                            LUCKY (CONT'D)
Staying out of trouble?             (low)
                                 T, come stand by me.

                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          Minding my business.

He ushers Terry towards the door.

                    HERO
          You look good.

                    LUCKY
          Yeah.
              (stepping out)
          Lonzo keep the change!


EXT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

Terry and Lucky pass A GROUP OF MEN playing dice out front.
Hero’s car pulls up, trailing them.

                    HERO
          ...Who’s this?

                    LUCKY
          Say “hi” T.

                    TERRY
          Hi.

                    HERO
          Aye Luck, let me talk to you.

                    LUCKY
          There’s nothing we need to talk
          about.

                    HERO
          Nah I just wanna catch up -

                    LUCKY
          So there’s nothing we need to catch
          up about.

Hero steps out of the car with his partner, attempting to hit
Lucky’s arm jokingly, but gets swiftly knocked away.

                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          Yo, get your hands off -

                    HERO
          You tried to hit me?
                                                           59.


       MAN PLAYING DICE                 HERO’S PARTNER
Ayo - come on, what y’all       Stay out of it!
doin’?

                    LUCKY
              (yelling)
          T, go upstairs!

Terry complies. Hero and his partner pin Lucky’s arm behind
him as he’s shoved and searched against the side of the car.


INT. LIVING AREA, INES’ APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Terry plops down on the couch without a word.

                    INES
              (busy cooking)
          Where’s Luck?

                    TERRY
          Downstairs with the cops.

                    INES
          Oh.

She pauses... then it hits her. Ines jets to the window,
three seconds later, she’s out of apartment.


EXT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

Ines keeps her distance from the policemen.

                    INES
          Officer, what’s the problem?

                    HERO
              (frisking)
          No prob, we’ll be outta shortly -


EXT. INES’ ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER

Lucky’s returned, lying on the bed in the same solemn state.

                    INES
          Everything’s changing. Couple of
          years from now, we won’t even have
          to worry about these kind of
          things.

He doesn’t respond. She cuddles up beside him.
                                                           60.


                    LUCKY
          What do two crooks know about
          raising a family?

She playfully pops him in the shoulder.


EXT. BASKETBALL COURT, NEIGHBORHOOD PARK - DAY

Lucky’s pensive, taking his time warming up with the ball, in
cadence. Terry, Pea and HALF A DOZEN KIDS from the block
surround him, trying to get it back but he keeps teasing.

LUCKY POV on a DRUG DEAL just out of the kids’ eye sight.

                    LUCKY
              (to Ines)
          Gimme kiss.
              (to kids)
          Watch this.
              (ball goes in)
          Give me another one.

Ines pecks his lips, blushing as he makes it again. Terry’s
not going for this. He stops playing, backing away.


             PEA                              INES
That’s not fair!                 A’right, A’right, that’s
                                 enough.


INT. HALLWAY, INES’ APARTMENT - DAY

Before Terry steps a foot out of his room, Ines bursts of her
own, in just a t-shirt and panties. Lucky’s chasing behind.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Lucky corners Ines by the wall, submerging her in kisses.


INT. KITCHEN, INES’ APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Terry’s disgusted as he holds a gallon of milk above his
cereal. He lets it drop to the floor.

                       TERRY
          I’m sorry.

                    INES
              (rushing over)
          It’s alright.
                                                           61.


In one glance, Lucky sizes up the real mess to clean up.

                    LUCKY (O.S.)
          You too sensitive -


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - DAY

                    INES
          So be sensitive to my sensitivity!

Terry slides from the dinner table and crawls to the couch,
dodging his parent’s leaps on and around furniture. They’re
still kids themselves.

             INES (CONT'D)                  LUCKY
You make a joke of              Let go of my arm!
everything! Lucky, who was
she?!

Lucky tumbles over the couch, facing the TV when he lands.
Ines nearly climbs over at him but stops midway.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET BLOCK PARTY, HARLEM - LATER

RETURN TO WARM WEATHER brings vibrance back to block. Ines
grips Lucky’s hands with no plans to let go. They’re
surrounded by a small cluster of NEIGHBORS, still in “wedding
attire” as if fresh from the courthouse.

Terry takes in the collision of music, noise and people
interacting; even voices echoing from a car zooming by. Lucky
spots Terry off to the side. He steps away from Ines,
kneeling down beside the child.

                     LUCKY
          T, your mother’s my wife now, but I
          want you to know from the bottom of
          my heart that I’m here for the both
          of you. We’re blood now.
              (then)
          You scared I’m gonna take her away
          from you?

                    TERRY
              (turning away)
          No...

                    LUCKY
          Nobody’s going anywhere from this
          point on.
                    (MORE)
                                                        62.

                     LUCKY (CONT'D)
          I promise to protect you and you
          other, with everything I have. You
          understand? Give you the life we
          never had.

Lucky hugs him, kissing Terry on his head as he gets back up.
It’s the first hug Terry’s ever received from a man.

                    FEMALE NEIGHBOR
              (holding camera)
          Come now, all three!

Awkwardly at first, Terry, Ines and Lucky pose for the photo.

                    NEWSREPORTER (V.O.)
          A slower, safer, more civilized
          city on the horizon -

NY1 plays while Ines moisturizes her scalp.

                    NEWSREPORTER
          I’m Vivian Lee with the NY1 Minute.
          According to the Mayor, the crack

          quality of life issue.

A slide goes up, next to the NEWSREPORTER, listing changes:
No jaywalking, graffiti, dogs without a leash, Squeegee Men,
turnstyle jumping.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY - MONTAGE

Like a real New York minute, we jump time.

- Ines hustles to work in NEW LOOK #1. She’s a working woman
now, still reinventing herself for fun.

- MATCH CUT as Ines gracefully crosses ANOTHER STREET, in NEW
LOOK #2 - much less herself, more mainstream.

- CUT TO images depict THE CHANGING FACE OF TIMES SQUARE.

                    NEWSREPORTER (V.O.)
          And if federal court lets new
          zoning laws take effect, starting
          today 42nd street will have to take
          on a new look to meet the law.

The reel cuts to the street interview of an EXOTIC DANCER.

          go in and watch a movie, you go in.
          If you don’t like it, you keep
          walking -


INT. TERRY’S ROOM, INES’     APARTMENT - DAY

Lucky finishes locking a gold cross around the neck of OLDER
TERRY (10, baby-faced). He waves his hands in prayer motion
over the child.

                    RADIO DJ (O.S.)
          Brooklyn officers charged today
          with torture and sodomizing a 25

          by the street crimes unit...

He cracks the window open, letting in fresh air and sounds.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, HARLEM - MOVING - DAY

CHYRON CARD - 2001

A row of more windows - early 20th century facades tower over
TERRY (13, scruffy hair but still baby-faced) PEA (13), AND
TWO OTHER FRIENDS. They’re all on bikes - taking ownership
of their streets. A few VOICES echo from out the windows,
friends stuck at home.

Like Lucky’s chain on his neck, Terry gleams more than ever
before. They cruise first, then pick up speed like a subway
car, accelerating so fast that the HOMES AND STOREFRONTS
BEHIND THEM START TO VANISH INTO A BLEND OF COLORS.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, HARLEM - LATER

Terry and Pea speed with synchronized haste down A CLEANER
CITY SIDEWALK.

                    PEA
          So I’m kickin’ it to her like “ah-
          ah-ah, whatever whatever...”

                     TERRY
          Yeah -

On Terry’s response, they SWEEP passed a PEDESTRIAN.
                                                           64.


                    PEA
          - but she still not goin’!


EXT. SIDE OF A BUILDING, OPEN BODEGA - MOMENTS LATER

Pea and Terry patted down by TWO OFFICERS, brown bodega paper
bags in hand.

                    PEA

          without no pussy, B! I’m not -

Mind shutting ya mouth for      My fault, sir -

Pea, Terry and half a dozen FRIENDS, huddle by the benches.

          fault me for caring about my heart!


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MOMENTS LATER

With new drinks in hand, sweaty Terry and Pea tease the curb
in synchronized haste past a NEW RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.
Tall, anti-social, glass windows standout like a thorn.

                    PEA
          What’s goin wit’ ya look -

Terry leaps to the sidewalk, avoiding a car. Back to the
synchronized march.

             PEA (CONT'D)                   TERRY
Even niggas from 4-5 don’t      Stop tryna knock my style -
lea’ the house like that.

                    PEA (CONT'D)
          - Since when’s “bum nigga” a style -

They HALT AND PIVOT IN UNISON, resting hands on the wall.

                                           MOMENTS LATER:

Pea and Terry are almost done being patted down, again.

                    OFFICER #1
              (releasing Terry)
          Thought you looked older.

                    OFFICER #2

          Daryl can be a little aloof
          sometimes...


INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

A Parent-Teacher conference. Terry, aka DARYL, sit across
from his middle school TEACHER. He’s beside INES (29) has
evolved, still hip, but more subdued, like a mid-30s woman
who has lived and put most of those fun days behind them.

                    TEACHER
          He daydreams a lot, but overall
          he’s a bright kid.
              (condescending)
          Quite articulate actually.

                    INES
              (deep sigh, insulted)
          Is that so?

                    TEACHER
          To be honest Mrs. Raymond, I don’t
          think he belongs here. What are
          your plans for next year?

Aloof Terry’s eyes turn to her.

                    INES
          He wants to go to Manhattan Center.

                    TEACHER
          Have you thought about applying for
          the specialized high schools?

                       INES
          No.

                    TEACHER
          You should. Would you be open to
          that Daryl?
                                                            66.


                    TERRY/DARYL
              (shrugging)
          If they got girls.

                    TEACHER
              (to Terry/Daryl)
          A lot of those kids go on to MIT,
          Harvard... It might take some
          getting used to... It wouldn’t be
          as many minorities...

                    INES
          My son’s never been ‘minor’ -

                       TERRY/DARYL
              (low)
          Ma, stop.

                    INES
          We’ll think about it.

                       TEACHER
          Please do.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL STREET, HARLEM - LATER

Ines, still annoyed, strolls with Terry towards the subway -
shaking off the way one feels when it’s assumed that you’re
an idiot. He play-hits her.

            TERRY                                 INES
What’s wrong -                          (joking)
                                     The hell happen to ya head?

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          I told you I want braids.

                     INES
          Can you not insult my eyes in the
          mean time?

                    TERRY
          Ma, you knew the store was shut
          down?

                    INES
          They sold the building.

                    TERRY
          So where we supposed to go?
                                                        67.


                    INES
          Go down to Ramirez’. What’s a
          couple of blocks.

                    TERRY
          I don’t like going over there.

                    INES
              (dismissive)
          Well...

                    TERRY
          We got stopped by the cops again.

                    INES
          Were they lookin’ for someone?

                    TERRY
          I’ono.

                    INES
          They take your name?

                    TERRY
              (irate, swerving scooter)
          No. I’m just callin’ out so you
          know it ain’t me.

Ines relents, taking in the strip’s transformation. The
business majority has shifted from LOCALLY-OWNED SHOPS TO
NATIONWIDE CHAINS. It’s hard to tell if we’re in Harlem or
Anywhere-Where-Else, USA.


EXT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

The block’s changed too - cleaner, less local characters and
foot traffic. Ines halts at the door, squinting at a nearby
residence being repainted. A FEMALE NEIGHBOR’s stooped below.

                    INES
          What’s going on down there?

                    FEMALE NEIGHBOR
          Someone bought the building.


INT. INES’ KITCHEN - DAY

Ines huddles of a paper on the counter. Terry hops by to get
to the fridge.

                    INES
          Anything change?
                                                        68.


                    TERRY
          Ma, I’m hungry.

             INES                           TERRY (CONT'D)
So, go to store.                With what money?

                    INES (CONT'D)
          I gave you some earlier this week.

            TERRY                            INES (CONT'D)
Ugh, come on. Please?           Hand me my purse.

Terry complies and Ines, digging into her wallet, retrieves a
a few bills. Before Terry can snatch it from her hand...

                    INES (CONT'D)
          I’ve got ten dollars to my name.
          I’m giving you five.

                    TERRY
          Thanks Ma...

Terry settles in the window, finishing off the carton of
orange juice. Ines tapping her cigarette pack on the table.

                    INES
          You thought anymore about what she
          said?

                      TERRY
          Who said?

                    INES
          Your teacher!

                    TERRY
          Why everything good mean I gotta go
          somewhere else?

                    INES
          You know I’m not gonna be here
          forever, right? What kind of life
          you want for yourself?

                    TERRY
              (shrugs)
          Guess that means you gotta live
          forever.

                    INES
          Oh, if only.

                    TERRY
          What’s up with you and Luck?
                                                         69.


                       INES
          Excuse me?

                    TERRY
          Y’all not talking or something?

                    INES
          Try asking him that and see what he
          says... but stop tryna change the
          subject. You don’t have to go, but
          at least have the option.


EXT. BASKETBALL COURT, INES’ APARTMENT COMPLEX - LATER

When Terry pops out of the building, he’s shocked to spot
LUCKY (33), still in his work clothes, shooting free throws.

                    LUCKY
          Come shoot some hoops with me.

                    TERRY
          I’m about to go to the store...

                    LUCKY
          You need some money? Here.

            TERRY                           LUCKY (CONT'D)
Ma gave me some -               - Take it anyway. A man
                                should always have money in
                                his pocket.

Stepping onto the court, Terry retrieves a few folded bills.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          But where you been at?

                    LUCKY
          Needed a few days to clear my head.

                    TERRY
          Feels like it’s been longer than
          that this time. Y’all breaking up
          or something?

Lucky nods no, before making another shot.

                    LUCKY
              (gesturing to ball)
          Wanna shoot?

He settles on the bench next to his construction gear. Terry
lingers under the hoop tossing shots.
                                                        70.


                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          Your mother ever tell you how we
          met?

                      TERRY
                (approaching)
          No.

                     LUCKY
          She used to work at this coffee
          shop that closed down a few years
          ago. I get my hair cut right across
          the street, so one day, I see her
          and I’m like “Who’s this fly shorty
          in the window?”
              (then)
          I go in. Order a bagel or whatever.
          I’m sitting down but still not
          really sure how to kick it.

                    TERRY
          So what’d you say?

                    LUCKY
              (thinks)
          I told her the truth. That she was
          the most beautiful woman I ever
          seen.

                    TERRY
          Were you nervous?

                     LUCKY
              (nods)
          I walked out. Just felt like she
          should know. Leave it at that.
              (then)
          But something told me to go back a
          few weeks later. And this is when I
          had my other bike, so... I said
          “let me take you for a ride when
          you get off.” She said “yeah”. We
          been rocking ever since.

Terry settles down next to him on the bench. Lucky takes in
the courtyard around them.

                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          T, don’t get caught up in none of
          this shit you see around here.

                    TERRY
          Have I ever?
                                                        71.


                    LUCKY
          No, but I’m not stupid. A lot of
          times it’s not even you, it’s the
          company you keep. Took me too long
          to learn that. Nothing worse on a
          man than not being able to provide
          for his own family. Keep the power
          you have over your life.

Terry gives him a beat to recover.

                    TERRY
          My uh... my teacher wants me to
          apply for the specialized science
          high schools...

                    LUCKY
          Yeah? So what you gonna do?

                    TERRY
          I don’t know... What you think?

                    LUCKY
          It’s not up to me. You getting
          older, time to start thinking for
          yourself.

Lucky abandons him on the bench, heading back onto the court.
Terry remains momentarily, but then musters up the courage to
join him. His stride’s full of angst.

                    TERRY
          What?

                    LUCKY
              (withholding ball,
               studying him)
          You need a haircut.

As Terry sucks his teeth, Lucky pulls him into his chest.

                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          ...I love you... You hear me?

                    TERRY
              (muffled, still hugging)
          Yeah!

When they release, Terry does all he can to hide his joy. He
takes the ball.
                                                           72.


INT. HALLWAY, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER

Lucky’s light on his toes, easing towards the bedroom.


INT. KITCHEN, INES’ APARTMENT - SAME TIME

Ines remains mum, letting him pass without a word.


INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Terry surrounded by a room full of PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS. They
huddled over the exams being distributed.

                    ADMINISTRATOR
          Do not open up your workbooks until
          every person has received an exam.
          There’s about fifteen to twenty
          questions in each portion, you’ll
          have approximately ten minutes per
          section to respond on the sheet -

TWO TEACHERS are off to the side, monitoring the group. One
of them, ANITA TUCKER (38) winks and smiles Terry’s way.


EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE, MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY

Lucky sweeps, then tosses big pieces of waste into the
dumpster. Construction noise muffles a SUPERIOR verbally
chastising him. Lucky retorts back, but the man has the last
word before marching off.


INT. INES’ BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Ines hits the snooze button on her alarm clock.


INT. INES’ BATHROOM - LATER

The shower head stutters at first, then flowing freely enough
for Ines to cleanse her soapy hair strands.


INT. INES’ BATHROOM - LATER

Ines makes the last touches on thickly-braided cornrows.
                                                        73.


INT. LAB FRONT DESK - LATER

Ines is the only clerk working the front desk. She feels the
glare of her SUPERVISOR, but sits up even prouder.

Her cellphone vibrates. She freezes at the sight of a text.


INT. INES’ KITCHEN - LATER

Terry is slouched over by his window nook. She’s snatches the
paper, unable to compose herself.

                    INES
          Let me see it!
              (reading)
          You got into Stuyvesant? Ain’t that
          the top one? I’m so proud of you -

She goes to embrace Terry but he dodges her.

                    TERRY
          I don’t see the big deal. All I
          had to do was prove I could get in.

                    INES
          I changed my mind.

                    TERRY
          Well I haven’t. I’m not going!

                    INES
          You know how hard I’m bussing my
          ass to get you chances I never had?
          You make me feel like a fool!

                    TERRY
          Be a fool then -

She hurls a dish he barely knocks out of the way in time.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          That almost hit my face!

                    INES
          Get the hell out before I knock the
          shit out of you.


INT. TOP CHOICE CARIBBEAN RESTAURANT - LATER

Pea and ANOTHER FRIEND (14) join Terry in the booth.
                                                         74.


                    PEA
              (eating)
          Nigga T always on the verge of
          tears.

Terry escapes to the restaurant counter. TERRY’S POV on the
CASHIER’s figure as she bends down to grab a new stack of
paper bags. SIMONE (14, dark brown) rings up his soda.

                    CASHIER/SIMONE
          Anything else?

                    TERRY
          Yeah, where can I call you?

She rolls her eyes.

            TERRY (CONT'D)             TERRY’S FRIENDS
...Aight, gimme your Myspace    - Yeahhh.
then.                           - Get it, T!

                    CASHIER/SIMONE
          Unavailable222.

                    TERRY
          Woowww, so I can’t get to know you?

        CASHIER/SIMONE                       PEA
There’s nothing else I need     Stop frontin’ like he ain’t
to know about you or ya         doin you a favor.
little smelly ass, dirty ass
friends.

                    CASHIER/SIMONE (CONT'D)
              (looking over Terry)
          Next customer!

Terry settles back down at the table.

                    PEA
          Knew you wasn’t gettin’ that.

                    TERRY
              (sucks teeth)
          I ain’t trippin’ on her.

                    PEA
              (munching)
          Cause I already tried four times.
          Gotta be a dike. She bad though.

Terry keeps staring at her.
                                                           75.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER

Ines rides the edge of her chair, staring at Lucky. He’s
dazed on the couch.

                    INES
          I need you to talk some sense into
          him.

                    LUCKY
          Sayin’ what exactly?

                    INES
          That he should go to a better
          school?

                    LUCKY
              (thinks)
          ...He doesn’t wanna be controlled.

                    INES
          Who gives a fuck about what he
          wants... what does he need?

She waits for a response...

                    INES (CONT'D)
          I’m talking to myself now -

                    LUCKY
          - I don’t know.
              (thinks)
          Matta fact, I do... it’s you. Not
          with me... with T I’m talkin’...

                      INES
          Like how?

                    LUCKY
          You could be a bit nicer. Less
          tough.

                    INES
          ...Anything else?

                    LUCKY
          - You’re always on edge...

                    INES
              (catching herself)
          What else? I’m listening.
                                                         76.


                    LUCKY
          Always beefin’... Maybe if you
          quiet down some... he’ll actually
          hear what you have to say.

She processes.

                    INES
          ...You used to like that I was
          spicy.

                    LUCKY
          He’ll do good at any school.

Ines thinks some more...

                    INES
          I’m trying to be quiet, anymore
          quiet I won’t have no voice at all -

                    LUCKY
          - See there it go.

                    INES
          Quiet’s not ‘when you go missing
          for weeks and I say nothing’?

                    LUCKY
              (rising)
          - I’m not arguing.

                    INES
          While you go through your ‘woe is
          me’ bullshit? Figure whatever-the-
          fuck out and I’m left fightin’ wars
          all by myself?!

                    LUCKY
          See how loud you are?

                    INES
          I’m talkin’ loud so you can hear
          me! You don’t understand quiet.
          Wonder what happens if I leave too -

            LUCKY                              INES (CONT'D)
I don’t gotta hear this right     Just cause I feel like it!
now.

                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          Never tired of being angry -
                                                        77.


                     INES
          When I got something to be angry
          about! We from the same fuckin’
          place! I’m tough like you tough,
          tired like you tired. So why’s it
          so hard for you to have my back?
              (then)
          Show up for me, Lucky!

                    LUCKY
          Are you done?

She plops back down in the chair.

                    INES
          Go be nice and tell him whatever
          you want.

Lucky’s faces her while he puts on his jacket, pausing midway
through. She’s quiet but still fidgeting.

                    LUCKY
          You’re scared...

            LUCKY (CONT'D)                   INES
Of gettin’ caught?              - Something’s gonna happen. I
                                can feel it.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          He tell you he got stopped by the
          cops? A few times.

             LUCKY                           INES (CONT'D)
   (thinks, then relaxes)       - That’s not the point!
Let him use his other name.
He doesn’t have ID -

                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          I don’t know.
              (placing jacket on)
          Days bound to come anyway -

Ines gets up and shoves him - so hard that when his back hits
the stove, the handle breaks off.

                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          It was a fuckin’ joke!


EXT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

Terry heading in, crosses paths with Lucky who’s heading out.
                                                         78.


                    LUCKY
          Take care of your mother.


INT. INES’ HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

When Terry steps inside Ines is back on the couch, waiting.

                    TERRY
          Where Lucky go?

                     INES
          I don’t know and don’t care.
              (then)
          I’m only saying this once. You go
          to that school or you find
          somewhere else to live.

                                              SHARP CUT TO:


EXT. FOOT’S APARTMENT, HARLEM - DAY

Terry slouches against his book bag. He’s got a “first week
of school” clean cut and crisp pair of Air Jordans on. Pea,
next to him on the couch, peruses a collection of CDs.

Pea, followed by their friend FOOT (19) glances at Terry.
Observing his pissy mood, they say nothing. Foot, seedy-
looking but largely harmless, returns to blasting tunes.

                    PEA
          Foot, where’s Blueprint?

                    FOOT
          Tony’s pickin’ it up around 11.

                    TERRY
              (sighs)
          We should get outta here soon.

             FOOT                            PEA
Time y’all headin’ to class?    - Iono, you got Dipset’s
                                mixtape?


INT. BEDROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER

The alarm clock reads 9:33AM as Ines’ slams the snooze
button. The otherwise quiet room rumbles with light thuds and
voices from other parts of the building. Meanwhile, NYPD
sirens steadily sound off outside, growing louder, closer,
and heading her way.
                                                        79.


She pops up, knocking about, slipping and nearly tumbling to
the ground on her way to the living room window.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Ines sticks her head out of the window just in time to catch
the brigade of SOUTH-BOUND COP CARS pass the building. OTHER
HARLEMITES look on too, from windows and fire escapes.

                    INES
          What happen?

                    NEIGHBOR AT WINDOW
          You haven’t seen the news? World
          Trade Center got hit.

A brief relief washes over her.

                    INES
          Again?

                    NEIGHBOR AT WINDOW
          Go up on the roof, you can see the
          smoke from Central Park-

But when she looks down at her hands, they’re both trembling.


INT. FOOT’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

An emergency vehicle rips by. Terry turns his head from the
window to TV. Pea, Foot and Terry watch, dumbfounded as smoke
descend from both towers.

                    FOOT
              (low, jaded)
          Tha’s white people problems.

Foot rises and starts stuffing some things into his pockets.

                    PEA
          Where you going?

                    FOOT
          Down to 12th. Nigga, there’s no
          cops in Harlem right now! Shit’s a
          fuckin’ holiday.

Pea and Terry keep watching in a stupor...

                    TERRY
          Yo, my school is down there.
                                                        80.


                    PEA
          You not going to school today.


EXT. FOOT’S APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

Pea and Terry run up to an NYPD car’s window.

           OFFICER                           PEA
Get out of the way! Go home!    Officer what’s goin on’?

                    TERRY
          Y’all headed down there?

The car rips off. Red firetrucks, blue and white NYPD
vehicles fly down an otherwise empty road, but Pea and Terry
are surrounded by halted foot traffic. TWO HARLEMITES ramble
in a fit of hysteria, outside of a local SHOP.

         HARLEMITE #1                    HARLEMITE #2
Both towers came down back to      (pulling SHOP gate down)
back, just crashed -            They hit the Pentagon too,
                                that’s not no accident, this
                                ain’t no accident -

The gate CRASHES down -- Terry picks up on the shifting
ambience. It’s an uneasy quiet. He climbs on top of a
mailbox, getting a better view of the chaos. Pea’s just below
him hungry for more action.


INT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING, COURTYARD - LATER

No traffic, just eery silence. When Terry arrives, Ines is
already outside.

                    INES
          Had me scared half to death -

                    TERRY
          - They let us out early.

                    INES
          What happened to the phone I gave
          you?

                     TERRY
          It died.
              (then)
          Where’s Luck?

                    INES
          Haven’t heard from him yet. His
          site’s downtown.
                                                          81.


They shrink at the overwhelming sirens around them. She looks
at him again, more thoughtful.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          How’d you get up here?

                    TERRY
          I got a ride.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER

Radio silence between Ines and Terry. TERRY POV on Ines
beating her cigarette box against the sill, in a rhythmic
pace. Finally, he goes for the remote.

                    INES
          Don’t turn the TV on.

Terry slips back on the couch. Noticing, Ines’ softens.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          Or if you want turn on it, put it
          on mute. I’m stressed enough.

                       TERRY
          Forget it.

Ines gets back on the house phone, dialing a number, taking
another gander out the window... scanning... searching... She
jets passed Terry towards the front door.


EXT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING, SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER

Lucky’s surrounded by several NEIGHBORS. His face and uniform
is partially covered in gray debris.

                    LUCKY
          I had to walk all the way up from
          Chamber Street.

                    NEIGHBORHOOD MAN
          Here boss, drink some water.

Lucky leans on the side of a car, taking sips from the bottle
and pouring the rest over his face. Ines and Terry arrive.

                       TERRY
          Pop!

Ines’ watches them, left behind as they embrace.
                                                          82.


                    LUCKY
          I’m good, T. I’m good.

Lucky then reaches for Ines. They peck lips, in a way that’s
both loving, yet awkward...

                    INES
          You sure you’re alright? ...Can’t
          be good to inhale all that stuff.

                     LUCKY
              (nods)
          Shit is just wild.
              (to everyone)
          I saw both towers come down. I had
          to carry this one lady ten blocks -

Ines attempts to comfort Terry, but he pulls away. Lucky
keeps talking, Terry beside him. Ines meanders away again,
quietly casting attention on the hole in the skyline.


EXT. DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY

Terry stares at an American flag waving above him and Lucky.
They’re among a huddle of PREDOMINATELY ITALIAN, IRISH, LATIN
AND BLACK AMERICAN CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, PLUS THEIR LOVED
ONES. All heads bow in prayer. Behind them, a sidewalk
memorial and tall gate filled with missing people posters.

                    CONSTRUCTION WORKER
          We doing this for Pat, our brothers
          Angelo and Andre. Every day that we
          come out here, this for them and
          their families.

The crowd applauds. Terry sees how intently Lucky listens.

                     CONSTRUCTION WORKER (CONT'D)
          For New York. We’re not rebuilding
          our city, we’re rebuilding our
          spirit! Coming out of this stronger
          than ever!

                    LUCKY
              (inspired, applauding)
          Go New York.


EXT. WORK SITE, UPPER MANHATTAN - DAY

Hard hats cover WORKERS milling about the roof of a NEW
RESIDENTIAL HIGH RISE.
                                                           83.


CHYRON - FOUR YEARS LATER

A pile of dirt hits the ground below. LUCKY (38) proudly
directs street traffic below, now supervising others.

                                                     LATER:

Lucky relaxes on the curb. LUCKY POV on the building. It’s
made of steel and glass like the skyscrapers - cold,
anonymous, yet magnificent.


INT. CLASSROOM, STUYVESANT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

TERRY (17), centered amongst racially diverse peers, is in a
daydream until the bell rings. He may carry himself
differently than others in the classroom, but now he owns it.


EXT. SIDE ENTRANCE, STUYVESANT HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

Terry unlocks his bike. He pauses before climbing on,
listening to the surrounding traffic.


EXT. DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Terry snakes through traffic with the same kind of wanderlust
he first experienced as a child in the cab with Ines.


EXT. UPTOWN MANHATTAN STREET - LATER

Terry joy rides through Harlem foot and traffic, still
peppered with bombastic sounds distinct to the neighborhood.


EXT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

Terry hands Lucky supplies while he plays music and fixes his
Harley motorcycle. The rest of Harlem may not have changed
much, but this block’s on it’s way to beautiful.

                    LUCKY
          I don’t understand how you ride
          that thing everyday.

                    TERRY
          I just like it.

                    LUCKY
          Uh huh. So which college you
          decidin’ on?
                                                          84.


                    TERRY
          I don’t know yet.

                    LUCKY
          Go somewhere far. My era ain’t have
          those kind of shots.

                    TERRY
          Yeah, maybe.

                     LUCKY
          Show off that legacy of Harlem.
              (then)
          You should be more excited.

                    TERRY
          Nah, I am...


EXT. COMMERCIAL STREET, HARLEM - DAY

INES (34) steps out of the train station.

                    MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Psst, Psst! Ayo, ma!

She’s surprised to see Lucky there waiting in front of a “IF
YOU SEE SOMETHING SAY, SOMETHING” advert.

                    INES
              (smiles)
          What you doing here?

                    LUCKY
              (bashful)
          I can’t walk my lady?

She’s still readjusting herself.

                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          What’s the matta witcha bag?

             INES                           LUCKY (CONT'D)
Random searches downstairs.        Oh.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          Haven’t seen you this happy in
          awhile.

                    LUCKY
          Yeah?

They stroll down the avenue, unburdened by the previous
tensions other PEDESTRIANS could bring.
                                                        85.


                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          Remember what this place was like
          when were coming up?

                    INES
          I remember.

                    LUCKY
          You should be proud of yourself.
          Ines, we made it.

Ines smiles, barely looking up. She’s reserved now, as he
wanted.

                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          You don’t seem happy...

                    INES
          You think Terry resents me?

                     LUCKY
          Teenagers hate everybody.
              (then)
          I do sense a little void in him...
          First couple years of his life he
          had nobody. Kid’s walkin’ ‘round
          with a broken heart.
              (then)
          Maybe it’s time for y’all to have a
          real conversation. Give him some
          answers he’s been looking for...

This coming from Lucky makes her brows furrow.

                     INES
          ...I’ll know when it’s   time.
              (then)
          Um. Once T goes off to   school, I
          think wanna go back to   doing hair
          again. Maybe open up a   shop.

                    LUCKY
          Can’t wait.


INT. INES’ APARTMENT - DAY

Ines opens the door on JERRY (31, white). He wears glasses,
but otherwise has a easygoing nature about him.

                    JERRY
          Hi, I’m Jerry.
              (clarifying)
          Your new landlord -
                                                86.


                    INES
              (shaking hand)
          - Good morning.

                    JERRY
              (stepping in)
          I wanted to come by and introduce
          myself.

                    INES
              (closing door)
          That’s nice of you.

                    JERRY
          I’ll be outta your way in a few
          minutes.

                    INES
          No, it’s alright.

Jerry looks around, inspecting.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          You have the buildings across the
          street too?

                    JERRY
          Yeah. I see you been here almost
          ten years. Everything working fine?
          Heat coming up, hot water?

                    INES
          Yeah, just about.
              (following him)
          Actually I noticed a few loose
          tiles around the shower -

                    JERRY
          Uh oh, something happened here?

Jerry notices the old damage to the stove.

                    INES
          Yeah, that’s old.

He’s crouched down to get a better look.

                    JERRY
          I can fix it for you.

                    INES
          Really?
                                                           87.


                    JERRY
          Yeah it’s no problem. And some new
          cabinets, these gotta be at least
          twenty years old. You meet Javier?

                    INES
          Who’s that?

                    JERRY
          The new Super. Let me see when I
          can have my guys come in. Take care
          of that and the tiles.


EXT. COURTYARD PARK, HARLEM - DAY

A lone firetruck sounds down the street. LUCKY listens to a
somewhat calmer, somewhat safer, surrounding neighborhood.

                                                    LATER:

He coaches a TEAM OF YOUTH BASKETBALL PLAYERS. Following
after them, he moves slower than usual. Short of breath.


INT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL - LATER

Lucky fights his way up the steps as best he can, then
finally collapses.


INT. CANCER WARD, HOSPITAL - DAY

Terry sits at the edge of Lucky’s hospital bed sifting
through a box of CDs and vinyls.

                    TERRY
          Which one you wanna hear?

Lucky pulls a 70’s era soul record from the pile.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          That’s mad old.

                    LUCKY
          Old. Pass that one right there.

Terry hands him a Hip Hop album. Lucky points at the credits.

                     LUCKY (CONT'D)
          What does that say? What’s the
          sample?
              (then)
          You don’t even know your own taste.
                                                        88.


                    TERRY
          But some of these are so random.

He keeps sifting anyway.

                    LUCKY
          You can have ‘em. That way you can
          take your time and flip through
          everything.

Still in work clothes, Ines rushes in. She hangs her jacket.

                    INES
          Anyone else come by?


INT. CANCER WARD, HOSPITAL - DAY

Lucky, visibly more ill, admires Ines who’s fast asleep in
the chair opposite his bed. She wakes at his coughing.

                    INES
          Try to finish your food.

                    LUCKY
          I’m not hungry.

Recollecting himself, he fixes his eyes on her.

                    LUCKY (CONT'D)
          Why’d you love me?

                    INES
          Same reasons everybody else.

                    LUCKY
          That’s not an answer... I wanna
          know why.

                    INES
          Stop talking and get some rest.

Lucky complies, albeit briefly.

                    LUCKY
          I don’t think I ever really knew
          where it came from. Whether or not
          I deserved it. And maybe that’s why
          I never fully gave it back.

                    INES
              (stunned, then dismissive)
          Damaged people don’t know how to
          love each other, tha’s all.
                                                          89.


A NURSE interrupts to check his vitals.


INT. TERRY’S ROOM - DAY

Terry sifts and listens to Lucky’s eclectic collection.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL STREET - LATER

Terry cruises alone. However, this time his pace is slower,
jazzier, and influenced by his broadening musical palette.


INT. TOP CHOICE CARIBBEAN RESTAURANT - LATER

Terry’s alone, long-faced over the scraps of a meal.
Suddenly, a carton of fried plantains lands on his table.

                    SIMONE
              (walking away)
          Try not to look so pitiful.

TERRY’S POV on SIMONE (18), moving with her head held high,
resumes work behind the counter.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER

Ines enjoys a private moment of reflection, peering out the
window. Terry exits the kitchen, heading for his room.

                    INES
          T, sit down.
              (when he settles)
          Um. There’s a few things I want to
          talk to you about. Before Lucky
          passed -

                    TERRY
          Don’t talk to me about Lucky.

                    INES
          It’s not about him -

                    TERRY
          I don’t want to talk to you about
          anything.

Ines just stares back at him, baffled.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          Only thing I wanted more than a
          mother was a fucking father.
                    (MORE)
                                                         90.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          Maybe if you didn’t push so hard on
          him, walking around here so
          miserable all the time, he’d still
          be here.

Ines sits back, as if to imply, “Is that so?”:

                       INES.
          Huh.
              (then)
          You don’t mean that.

He doesn’t respond. Ines takes a moment to herself, briefly
peering out of the window again, then leaves the room.


EXT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING, ENTRANCE - DAY

Ines lands in the doorway, resting as NEIGHBORS blast tunes,
dance and eat. It’s their version of a sendoff for Lucky.
INES POV on a YOUNG KIDS saddled up on Lucky’s parked bike.

She eases down the stoop, joining the effort to share out
portions. Terry, a few feet away with FRIENDS, narrows eyes
down the street.

                    TERRY
          Ma...
              (waits)
          Ma!

                       INES
          - What?

                    TERRY
          That lady keeps looking over here.

Near the corner, a WOMAN and FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL, stand
waiting. Hesitating at first, Ines waves them over.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          Who’s that?

                    INES
          Lucky’s daughter and her mother.
          Fix them a plate. I need to run
          upstairs.

                       TERRY
          His what -

                    INES
          We’ll talk about it later...
                                                           91.


Before Terry can respond, Ines abandons him on the sidewalk.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - DAY

Ines allows the TWO WORKERS to enter the space.


INT. INES’ BEDROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Ines returns to her bed, flipping channels and slurping up a
Cup-of-Noodles.

THE SOUND of heavy bangs and drilling.

She chews....

THE SOUND of heavy bangs, louder drilling.

Ines keeps on nibbling...

THE SOUND of heavy bangs, louder drilling and a HUGE THUD.

Ines freezes, nearly spilling the soup.


INT. INES’ BATHROOM - DAY

Ines stands with Jerry, pointing her finger at the gaping
hole in the destroyed bathtub.

                    INES
          It wasn’t so big at first but more
          fell down this morning.

Jerry listens, inspecting the floor and dislocated sink.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          All we got right now is the kitchen
          sink.

                    JERRY
          I know, I know.

                    INES
          Come, let me show you the kitchen.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

                    JERRY
          I saw it already.

Terry’s sprawled out on the couch listening to his CD Player.
                                                92.


                    JERRY (CONT'D)
              (eyes shifting)
          Ines, uh -- look, this is my
          mistake. The guys thought it was a
          full flip. I’m happy to let them
          come back in here and finish, I
          won’t charge you anything.

                    INES
          Just let me know what day. I can
          stay home from work or Terry can be
          here if it’s after school -

                    JERRY
          We’ll need to clear you out of the
          apartment. It’s too much damage
          here, gotta lift everything.

                    INES
          Like how long?

                    JERRY
          ‘Til it’s done. Couple of months?

He tenses up and so does Ines.

                    INES
              (elevated tone)
          And what are we supposed to do in
          the meantime?

                    JERRY
          Calm down -

                    INES
          Don’t tell me to calm down -

                    JERRY
              (condescending)
          Like two adults. Okay?

Ines complies, burying her old instinct.

                    INES
          We have no shower... and no stove.

                    JERRY
          Maybe there’s friend of yours or
          family you can stay with? The
          building’s too old. I fix one
          thing and I’ll just have to come
          back a few months later. That way
          we can get in here and replace
          everything all at once.
                                                        93.


                    INES
          There’s gotta be another option...

                    JERRY
          Or you can leave.

She looks him dead in the eyes. It’s not as warm as before.

                    JERRY (CONT'D)
          My hands are tied. Give me a call
          when you know what you wanna do.

She closes the door behind him. Terry lifts his headphones.

                    TERRY
          Why you ain’t fight him on that?

Ines cuts eyes at him, then heading for her bedroom.


INT. INES’ KITCHEN - LATER

Terry’s in his spot by the window, accompanied by a telephone
book. He listens to drilling in the apartment above as he
dials a 212 number.


INT. TOP CHOICE CARIBBEAN RESTAURANT - SAME TIME

Simone’s tending to a short line of CUSTOMERS.

                    SIMONE
              (answering phone)
          Top Choice. Simone speaking.

                    TERRY (O.S.)
          Simone?

                    SIMONE
          Yes?

                    TERRY (O.S.)
          I just wanted to let you know, I
          think you’re the most beautiful
          girl -

                    SIMONE
          Would you stop fucking calling
          here, please? I’m at work -

                    TERRY
          Call me tonight then.

She thinks.
                                                           94.


                    SIMONE
          Fine. I gotta go.

She takes the number down and hangs up.

                    SIMONE (CONT'D)
          Miss, to stay or to go?


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL STREET - DAY - MOVING

Terry and Simone saunter quietly.

                    TERRY
          Walk on the other side of me.

He guides her to the inside of the sidewalk, seizing the
opportunity to touch her waist.

                     SIMONE
          Um?

                    TERRY
          It’s for protection.

                     SIMONE
          Right...

                    TERRY
          You always this quiet?

                    SIMONE
          No... I’m just so used to cursing
          you out.

                    TERRY
          Oh so that’s what it is?

                    SIMONE
          ...But I’m trying to be nice.


INT. CHINESE FOOD TAKE OUT RESTAURANT - LATER

Terry’s dumbfounded at the sight of Simone drenching a carton
of four fried chicken wings and fries with barbecue sauce,
hot sauce and ketchup.

                    TERRY
          Think you’ve put enough?

She gobbles another fry, watching him then poke around.
                                                        95.


                    SIMONE
          You know you want one.

Terry takes a drenched one.

                    TERRY
          Why you always actin’ all stank
          when we come around.

                    SIMONE
          It’s not an act, your friends are
          dumb as fuck. Especially Pea.
              (mocking)
          “What you gon’ do about that
          ‘kitchen’? Damn, when you gon’ eat
          some more meals? Wowww! Whaddup
          Midnight?” -

                     TERRY
          - Alright, alright...
              (then)
          I get it.

She keeps eating.

                    SIMONE
          I’m sorry. I probably shouldn’t
          talk about your friend like that.

                    TERRY
          Yeah.

                    SIMONE
          I’m just tired of the way they talk
          about me. I got teased all through
          149, all through junior high... I’m
          not fucking with anybody tryna make
          me hate myself.

Terry’s stopped eating. He’s just listening now, admiring.

                     SIMONE (CONT'D)
          How’d you miss a year of school and
          still end up in Stuyvesant?
              (then)
          You like it there?

                     TERRY
              (shrugs)
          It’s okay.

                    SIMONE
          Okay and... what else? What don’t
          you like about it?
                                                        96.


                    TERRY
          I don’t know. Just don’t.

                    SIMONE
          There’s nothing wrong with being
          smart you know. We could use a few
          more engineers around here.

                    TERRY
          I don’t care about none of that.

                    SIMONE
          Oh yeah, so what do you wanna do?

                    TERRY
          I make music.

                    SIMONE
              (brow raising)
          You wanna rap?

                    TERRY
          No... like...

Terry tries to play it cool but he shrinks into the chair.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          Like, you ever seen ‘The Wiz’?

                     SIMONE
          Yeah.

                    TERRY
          ...Stuff like that. This black guy
          Quincy Jones did the whole score.
          And some other movies.

                     SIMONE
          Like...   a composer?

                    TERRY
              (shrinking)
          Yeah...

                     SIMONE
          P.S. I know who Quincy Jones is.
              (then)
          That’s why you don’t like it. You
          should be in some kind of arts
          school.
              (then)
          Do you know how to write music?
                                                97.


                    TERRY
          Nah, not yet.

                    SIMONE
          You should learn. You could go to
          Juilliard... I could help you find
          out what it takes.

                    TERRY
          It’s too late for that.

                    SIMONE
          Where’d Quincy Jones go?

                    TERRY
          He didn’t go to school.

                    SIMONE
              (smiles)
          See... look at that!

She dips another fry.

                    TERRY
          I wanna see you again.

                    SIMONE
          ...I should be honest with you. I’m
          moving in a couple of weeks.

                      TERRY
          For real?

                    SIMONE
          To my uncle’s in Florida. We lost
          our house, some confusion with the
          deed.

                    TERRY
          Oh... Sorry to hear that.

                    SIMONE
          I think my mother’s tired of being
          here anyway. We can still keep in
          touch thought. On myspace...

                      TERRY
          Yeah.

                    SIMONE
          I wanna hear your songs. Maybe you
          can write one for me -
                                                          98.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER

Terry slumps down in front of the TV. Ines tends to the
makeshift kitchen.

                       INES
             Why you look so glum.

                         TERRY
             I’m fine.

Terry looks up from the TV.

                       INES
             What’s her name?

                       TERRY
             I’on know what you’re talking
             about.

                       INES
             So who’s the girl I saw you outside
             with?

He thinks.

                       TERRY
             Just a girl.

                       INES
             She ya girlfriend?

                       TERRY
             I like Spanish girls, Ma.

                        INES
             Pardon me?
                 (then)
             What, she look too much like you to
             take seriously?

Sensing he won’t respond, Ines shakes her head.

                       INES (CONT'D)
                 (thinks)
             You know little boy, I love you,
             but I don’t know if I really like
             you anymore.


INT. TERRY’S ROOM - NIGHT

Terry lies awake. Then, a noise in the next room causes him
to jump up.
                                                        99.


INT. INES APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ines, in the puddle of a flooded kitchen and living room.

                    TERRY
          Ma, what happened?

                    INES
          Can you bring me a cloth?

As Terry steps closer, he sees how the inches of water have
already ruined the couch bottom and stereo system. Ines opens
the console beneath the TV, releasing water trapped inside.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          I’m gonna call Miss Annie in the
          morning. See if you can stay over
          there for the rest of the week.


INT. CLASSROOM, STUYVESANT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Terry/Daryl leans over his desk, not at all engaged with the
social studies lesson. He pushes his chair out.

                    TEACHER
          Daryl, is there an issue?

                    TERRY/DARYL
              (leaving)
          I need to be excused.


INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELER’S OFFICE - LATER

Terry’s slumped in a chair as the counselor, Anita Tucker,
towers over him. This is the same teacher Terry encountered
while taking the entry exam. You can tell she’s the popular
type amongst students; relatable but still respected.

                    MS. TUCKER
          Now what was that all about?

Terry barely moves, as if he’s checked out.

                    MS. TUCKER (CONT'D)
          Showing up late, not handing in
          your work and now just... walking
          out? Something’s on your mind.

                    TERRY/DARYL
          I said I’m fine.
                                               100.


                    MS. TUCKER
          What’s going on with the college.
          You made your decision?

He’s drifted again.

                      MS. TUCKER (CONT'D)
          Daryl?

                      TERRY/DARYL
          Not yet.

                    MS. TUCKER
          And why’s that? You discuss this
          with your mother?

                    TERRY/DARYL
          Yeah a little.

                    MS. TUCKER
          You know this is a safe place.

Terry thinks.

                    MS. TUCKER (CONT'D)
          How have things been at home since
          your father passed?

                    TERRY/DARYL
          The landlord’s pushin’ us out.

                    MS. TUCKER
              (frowning)
          I’m sorry to hear that.

Ms. Tucker thinks to herself.

                    MS. TUCKER (CONT'D)
          When do you turn eighteen again?

                    TERRY/DARYL
          End of the month.

                    MS. TUCKER
          Would you want to come work with
          me? I run the after school program
          at CCA. A few hours part time.

                    TERRY/DARYL
          How much it pay?

                    MS. TUCKER
          It’s money. Enough to help you and
          your mom a little.
                    (MORE)
                                                         101.

                     MS. TUCKER (CONT'D)
          You do good, we’ll work on
          something better this summer.
              (then)
          I don’t need working papers since
          you’re turning eighteen soon.
          Ask your mother for your birth
          certificate and social.

                    TERRY/DARYL
          Thank you, Ms. Tucker.

                    MS. TUCKER
          Happy to help.

She’s still studying him as he turns to leave.


INT. MANAGEMENT OFFICE, INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Ines strides slowly, in sync with the broken traffic light on
the corner. It jolts from red to green.

                                                   LATER:

She snaps a photo of her rent check, using her flip phone.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER

Terry unlocks the front door.

                    TERRY
          Ma?


INT. INES’ BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Terry searches all of Ines’ drawers until he finds the manila
envelope with his birth certificate and social.


INT. PEA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Pea snores on his bed. Terry’s sprawled on a blow up mattress
wide awake. He sits up, pulling out a sheet of paper and
pencil. Using a textbook to guide him, he sketches out the
notes of a melody.


INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR OFFICE - DAY

Terry’s barely made his way through the door.
                                                     102.


                    MS. TUCKER
          Daryl, we need to talk. Your
          paperwork was denied.

                    TERRY/DARYL
          What?

                    MS. TUCKER
          That social security number you
          gave me isn’t valid. I’m glad I
          caught it before anyone else did.

                    TERRY/DARYL
          I forgot it expired.

                    MS. TUCKER
          ...That’s not how it works.

                    TERRY/DARYL
          So then, I don’t know. Does this
          mean I can’t get the job?

                    MS. TUCKER
          Before I can even look into any of
          that, we’ve gotta straighten out
          how you ended up with a phony
          papers. Did you really ask your
          mother?

                    TERRY/DARYL
          She doesn’t have ‘em.

                    MS. TUCKER
          You are from here right?

                    TERRY/DARYL
          What you mean?

                    MS. TUCKER
          Born in the States?

                    TERRY/DARYL
          Oh. Yeah, yeah.

                    MS. TUCKER
          This could mean a lot of hell for
          you. To get a job, to do anything -

                    TERRY/DARYL
          It’s probably still with the city.
          From when I was in foster care.

Ms. Tucker thinks, then picks up her office phone.
                                                103.


                    MS. TUCKER
              (dialing)
          I have a friend down in social
          services who can help -

                    TERRY
          Nah, it’s cool.

                    MS. TUCKER
              (into phone)
          Hey Janice, listen I need a favor.
          I have a student here -

                    TERRY
              (hanging up phone)
          Ms. Tucker, I said it’s alright!

Ms. Tucker jumps back, bewildered.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          They don’t know I’m with my mother.

                     MS. TUCKER
          ...And why’s that?
              (then)
          Who are you supposed to be with?

Terry thinks.

                    MS. TUCKER (CONT'D)
          Have you told anyone else about
          this?

                    TERRY
          No.

                    MS. TUCKER
              (thinking, then)
          Is Daryl your real name?

More stand off from Terry.

                    MS. TUCKER (CONT'D)
              (voice raising)
          If you lied on your college
          applications, that’s a felony -

                    TERRY
          - Its Terry. Terry Wallace.

                    MS. TUCKER
          How long ago did this happen?
                                                           104.


                     TERRY/DARYL
           When I was little.

                      MS. TUCKER
           I was a social worker for years.
           If the city didn’t want to give you
           back, it’s likely because something
           happened.
               (then)
           Regardless of what, you’re still a
           ward of the state. By law, I have
           to report this.

                     TERRY/DARYL
           I’ll be eighteen in a few more
           weeks. Why does it even matter?

                     MS. TUCKER
           I can’t keep this to myself, not as
           long as I know. And going under a
           different name - this is such a
           mess. I have to speak with your
           mother.


EXT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING, ENTRANCE - LATER

A BURST OF NEW YORK CITY CLAMOR as Ines leans against a
neighbors car, seething. A few remnants of her old personal
style has returned. She watches everyone who enters the
building. Her WHITE FEMALE NEIGHBOR hits the steps.

                     INES
           Sweetheart. You see Javier lately?

                        WHITE NEIGHBOR
           Who?

                        INES
           The Super.

                     WHITE NEIGHBOR
           Not since yesterday.

             INES                           WHITE NEIGHBOR (CONT'D)
Alright.                           Sorry.


INT. KITCHEN, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER

When Terry steps inside, Ines is busy nursing the leaks in
the ceiling with various pots and bins. He observes the
gaping hole and the panels that have fallen to the floor.
                                                      105.


                    INES
          What you doing home?

                    TERRY
          Can I talk to you?

                    INES
          It’d be nicer if you can help.

                    TERRY
          What happened?

                     INES
          What does it look like? I called
          the Super about ten times since
          yesterday.

                     TERRY
          It’s about the job with Ms. Tucker.
          She said I need my birth
          certificate.
              (then)
          The real one. And my social.

She pauses the work.

                    INES
          What do you mean ‘the real one’?

                    TERRY
          The papers I found in your room
          didn’t work -

                    INES
              (yelling)
          What do you mean the papers from my
          room? You gave her that?

             INES (CONT'D)                  TERRY
Why wouldn’t you ask me?!        I didn’t know I had to!

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          She said she wants to come by
          tomorrow evening and talk to you.

Ines takes a seat.

                       INES
          For what?

                    TERRY
          I don’t know, what was I supposed
          to say?
                                                          106.


                     INES
          I don’t know how the hell we gon’
          get ahold of that.
              (then)
          Come with me outside. I need to
          smoke.


EXT. ENTRANCE, INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

Terry joins Ines on the stoop.

                    INES
          T, you should see if you can stay
          with Pea for a bit longer. While
          Jerry’s fixing everything.

                    TERRY
          And where you gonna go?

                    INES
          I’ll figure out. Don’t worry about
          me.

In the silence between them, Ines smokes what’s left of her
cigarette. INES POV on the traffic light. Ticking between red
and green, it’s finally getting repaired by a CITY WORKER.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          What time your teacher coming by
          tomorrow?

                    TERRY
          ‘Round six, I think.

Ines smokes in pensive trance, then cuts eyes at Terry.

                    INES
          You wanted to leave me...

                      TERRY
          No?
              (then)
          Why would you say that?

She holds her gaze.

                    INES
          Forget it, come on. I should clean
          up from now and get it over with.
                                                       107.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Ines heads towards the kitchen. Terry trails behind.

                     INES
              (soft)
          I don’t need any help, T. All you
          gon’ do is slow me down.

                    TERRY
          Okay.

                    INES
          I’ll go to your school tomorrow,
          and straighten everything out with
          Miss Whats-Her-Face.

Terry watches her disappear into the kitchen. WE HEAR Ines
shuffling the water-filled pots as he heads to his room.


INT. TERRY’S ROOM - LATER

Terry lies down, listening to the ceiling fan whirl. Murmurs
of conversations bleed in from the street as his eyes shut.


INT. HALLWAY, INES’ APARTMENT - LATER

Terry moves through the quiet corridor. The sounds of
neighbors in the hallway spill in from the front door that’s
been left ajar. Terry shuts the door, locking it behind him.

                    TERRY
          Ma?

He peers into the half-cleaned kitchen, but she’s not there.
Terry moseys over towards the bedroom... She’s gone.


INT. KITCHEN, INES’ APARTMENT - MORNING

Terry’s like a hawk, eyes on the courtyard.

                    TERRY
              (to Kim, on the phone)
          Hey Titi... you heard from my
          mother yet?

We see Anita Tucker, alongside FEMALE ACS CASE WORKER and TWO
POLICE OFFICERS exiting a car out front. The teacher and
officials make their way to the entrance.
                                                       108.


                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          Well can you call me back when you
          do? I’ve been trying her all
          morning.

A knock at the front door.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          Aunt Kim, hold on. Lemme give you a
          call back....


INT. FRONT DOOR, INES’ APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Terry cracks the door open, revealing Ms. Tucker, the case
worker and officers.

                    MS. TUCKER
          Hi Terrance. Is your mother home?

                    TERRY
          No.

                    MS. TUCKER
          She left for work already?

                    TERRY
          I think so.

                    MS. TUCKER
          You mind if we came in and talk to
          you for a bit?

                    TERRY
          Um... um yeah. Okay.

The officials enter. Terry shakes everyone’s hand.

                    MS. TUCKER
          This is Anne. And this is Officer
          Phillips. Officer Picone. May we
          have a seat?

                    TERRY
          Yeah. Hold on, sorry -

Terry moves to clears his book bag and other personal
belongings from the couch. Ms. Tucker the case worker settle
across from Terry. Meanwhile, he peeps the officer’s
movements around the landlord-neglected space.

                    CASE WORKER
          How long ago did she leave?
                                                       109.


                    TERRY
          Yesterday evening.

                    OFFICER #1
          What was the last thing she said to
          you? Did she say anything out of
          the ordinary? Anything unusual?

                    TERRY
          Not that I remember. Everything
          seemed fine.
              (irritated)
          Could y’all not go through all our
          stuff?

                     MS. TUCKER
              (to officers)
          Guys, can you please.
              (then)
          Terrance, we really need your
          cooperation on this.

                    TERRY
          It’s Terry. Is she gonna get in
          trouble? Why does it even matter?
          I’m almost eighteen.

All adults exchange glances.

                    MS. TUCKER
          Well... about that. It’s difficult
          for me to say what I have to say
          right now but, Ines is not your
          biological mother.

Terry looks to the others for clarity.

                    TERRY
          This some kind of joke?

                    MS. TUCKER
          No. It’s not.

Anita retrieves two large Manila envelopes from her handbag.
The first reveals Terry’s foster care records, which she
plops down on the coffee table.

                    CASE WORKER
          Terry, this is who you are...

She hands several files and images over to Anita.
                                                       110.


                    ANITA
          Look, and this is the woman who
          abducted you.

They’re mug shots and criminal files for young Ines.

                    OFFICER #1
          Whatever she told you was just some
          lie she cooked up.

Terry eyes travel to the old criminal records.

                    MS. TUCKER
          I’m sorry you have to find out this
          way.

                    OFFICER #1
          Are you sure you don’t know where
          she is? No ideas at all?

                    TERRY
          No.

The officer retreats.

                    MS. TUCKER
          Give him some room. For now we
          should focus on what’s best for
          Terry going forward.

                    TERRY
          What’s best for me?

They don’t hear.

                    MS. TUCKER
              (to case worker)
          He doesn’t have any other known
          relatives we can trust.

                    CASE WORKER
          That’s fine, we can place him at
          Sheltering Arms for the time being.

         CASE WORKER (CONT'D)               ANITA
It’s a family services          I know what it is.
program.

                    CASE WORKER (CONT'D)
          Just for a couple of weeks until we
          can navigate next steps.
              (to Terry)
          If that’s alright with you?
                                                          111.


The adults turn back to Terry, awaiting his confirmation.
Finally, he nods.


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES APARTMENT - LATER

Terry, alone in the space, takes his home in for the last
time. The front door’s ajar, so he doesn’t hear Ms. Tucker
creep back in, knocking just below the tattered 10 01 sign.

                       MS. TUCKER
          You ready?


EXT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

Terry steps outside with the officials. His block’s the
quietest it’s ever been as he steps into the car.


INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS, SHELTERING ARMS - DAY

A room full of bunks. Terry joins OTHER BOYS waking up and
making their beds.


INT. COMMON ROOM, SHELTERING ARMS - LATER

Terry and Ms. Tucker sit across from each other in silence.

                    MS. TUCKER
          Were you aware that Ines and Lucky
          had a miscarriage?

Terry’s brows furrow.

                    MS. TUCKER (CONT'D)
          A little boy, while she was in
          jail.

He remains stoic.

                    MS. TUCKER (CONT'D)
          I know it’s a lot on your mind. And
          it will be for a long time... I
          just hate that she got away with
          this for so long...

                    TERRY
          I don’t know where she is...

                    MS. TUCKER
          That’s fine.
              (handing over files)
                    (MORE)
                                               112.

                    MS. TUCKER (CONT'D)
          To look over on your own time. ACS
          still hasn’t located your birth
          family, but we’re working on it.

Ms. Tucker grips her temples.

                     MS. TUCKER (CONT'D)
          Everything was such a mess back
          then, ‘93, ‘94. In my office, only
          records you had on some kids was
          just an index card.
              (then)
          I don’t know what else to say.
          Except that I am sorry this
          happened to you, Terrance.

                     TERRY
          And what about everybody else?
              (then)
          The lady who kidnapped me, but
          actually took care of me, is a
          criminal. I get that. But what
          about everyone else?

He pushes his chair out.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          I think we’re done.


INT. SHELTERING ARMS, RECEPTION - LATER

Terry heads for the front exit.

                    TERRY
          I left a couple books by my
          friend’s house.

She taps the clipboard on the desk.

                    COUNSELOR
          You gotta sign out.

                    TERRY
          Sign out for what?

                    COUNSELOR
          Every time you leave. You know the
          time for curfew?

                    TERRY
          Curfew.
                                                       113.


                    COUNSELOR
          Wait, wait - excuse me! Hello?!

He’s already out the door.


EXT. KITCHEN, MISS ANNIE’S HOUSE - DAY

Miss Annie gathers dinner ingredients scattered across the
countertop as Pea and Terry hang in the adjoined living room.

                    MISS ANNIE
          Pea, where’s your mother?

                    PEA
          She said she on her way.

She cast a heartwarming glance at Terry.

                    MISS ANNIE
          Still nothing after all this time?

Terry nods.

                    MISS ANNIE (CONT'D)
          Where you staying?

                    TERRY
          The youth home on 132nd.

                    PEA
          Why don’t you come stay with us?
          You know we got room here.

                    TERRY
          I’m not tryna burden anybody.

                    MISS ANNIE
          Baby, I don’t know there’s such
          thing as ‘home’ for anybody black,
          but you’re more than welcomed here
          if you need some place to live.

Terry lingers on Miss Annie’s words.

                    PEA
              (switching subjects)
          Peep what’s going on outside?

Terry leans over Pea to get a view. A WHITE FEMALE NEIGHBOR
running out of the house to flag the ice cream truck.
                                                       114.


                    TERRY
          She wants him to turn off the
          music.

The DRIVER continues blasting tunes, but the woman whips her
Blackberry phone out and puts the receiver to her ear.

                    PEA
          Ice Cream Iris.

Terry returns back to his spot on the couch. For the first
time, he contemplates the comforts of this home.

                    PEA (CONT'D)
              (mocking)
          “Hello, officer... yes I’m calling
          again to complain about how black
          my neighborhood is.”

                    MISS ANNIE
          Neighborhood’s getting better if
          you ask me.

                     PEA
          For who?

                    MISS ANNIE
          Me... and white people! Ha! You
          know people keep coming ‘round,
          trying to buy the house.

                    PEA
          What? You ain’t tell me that.

                    TERRY
          It’s gonna get worse?

                    MISS ANNIE
              (not hearing Terry)
          Mhm, guess how much.

                    PEA
          Three-Fifty?

                    MISS ANNIE
          Four. ‘magine how much it’s
          probably worth. I ain’t moving
          shit. As hard as me and your
          grandfather worked to get this. But
          that white couple downstairs paying
          FOUR TIMES what I used to get.

Terry frowns.
                                                       115.


                    PEA
          If anybody else comes around, you
          let me do the talking.

                    MISS ANNIE
          Oh, I bet you would.


EXT. PAYPHONE, NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - LATER

Terry cradles himself into the booth along a quiet strip.

                    KIM (O.S.)
          Hello?

                    TERRY
              (a whimper)
          ...Titi?

                    KIM
          Yeah, Terry is that you?

                    TERRY
              (whimpering)
          Yeah...

                    KIM (O.S.)
          Terry, what happened to you?

                    TERRY
              (whimpering)
          ...I don’t know...


EXT. SHELTERING ARMS - SAME TIME

                    KIM
          Listen, I’m in New York. I came to
          get you, but I stopped by the home
          and nobody knows where you are.

                                                INTERCUT:

                    TERRY
          I’m at a payphone.

                    KIM (O.S.)
          Want to meet me back here?

                    TERRY
          Okay.
                                                       116.


                    KIM (O.S.)
          Okay. I think you should stop by
          the house first... Pick up any last
          things you want to take with you...


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Terry gazes down the long avenue. Heading for the curb, he
waits for a car to pass. He drops his skateboard and kicks
away from the QUIET sidewalk...


INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

When Terry steps in, we see the figure of Ines packing a few
items into a garbage bag.

                       TERRY
          Ma?

Ines pauses momentarily, then continues on. She’s cut her
hair into a shorter pixie style, natural texture competing
with remnants of relaxer.

                       INES
          Hi, Terry.

                    TERRY
          What are you doing?

                    INES
          I left some things.

Terry tries his best to not side-eye. She continues packing.

                    INES (CONT'D)
          Don’t stand there looking over me.
          I know they already got to you
          so... feel free to run along.

He takes this in.

                    TERRY
          But can we talk?

                    INES
          Talk about what?

                    TERRY
          Are you serious right now?

                    INES
          Fine, you wanna talk? Let’s talk.
                                                        117.


Ines drops the bag, sauntering over towards the table. Terry
joins, but barely sits down before...

                    INES (CONT'D)
          - Fetch me my Newports.


            TERRY                             INES (CONT'D)
You were just over there -          (dismissive)
                                 Over on the stand.

Terry complies begrudgingly - some things don’t change. He
returns, slapping the cigs and lighter down on the table.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          Is all they’re saying really true?

                    INES
          What you want me to say? That I
          fucked up? Yeah I fucked up... but
          life goes on, so.

                    TERRY
          ...As long as it’s your call -

                    INES
          - Did I make the choice or did you?
          Standing there in that hospital.

                    TERRY
          Thinking you was my fucking mother!

                    INES
          Don’t you raise your voice at me.
          I’ll still knock your narrow ass
          down -

                    TERRY
              (resettling)
          - Did Lucky know?

                    INES
              (reluctantly)
          Yeah he knew. Didn’t agree with it,
          but he knew.

Ines puts the cigarette out on her ashtray.

                    TERRY
          So why’d you do it -

                    INES
          I don’t know why, T. I don’t know
          why I did what I did.
                    (MORE)
                                                          118.

                       INES (CONT'D)
             It was just a little thing that
             became something else...

Silence...

                       TERRY
             ...And that makes it right?

                        INES
             - Oh shut the hell up! Who made you
             the chief of right and wrong?
             You think I don’t have feelings
             too? Like I didn’t spend all those
             years taking care of you?
                 (then)
             - Who the fuck was there to ever
             take care of me?! You want hear
             “sorry,” but who’s gonna say sorry
             to me!
                 (then)
             God forbid I stand up for anyone
             else, let alone Ines, you the only
             we get to feel sorry for.

Ines finally pulls out a cigarette. Terry gives her the
chance to calm back down.

                       TERRY
             Did you lie about all of it?

She thinks, pulling out another cigarette.

                       INES
             Not the part about loving you, no.
             Not that you ever cared.

                       TERRY
             Don’t put words in my mouth -

                       INES
             Please, nobody gives a shit about
             black women ‘cept for other black
             women and even that shit is messy -

                       TERRY
             - That’s not true!

                       INES
             - You didn’t give a damn unless you
             needed me! Not just you, everybody!

The sound of a siren elsewhere spills in.
                                                       119.


                    TERRY
          - You were my mother! Now how am I
          supposed to feel?

Resettling by the window, Ines sees a few nosey neighbors
gathering across the street.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          They not gon’ let you get away.

                     INES
          I’m not going to jail...
              (then)
          I’ll miss this smelly little fucked
          up city. Was only a matter of time.

                    TERRY
          Before what?

                    INES
              (thinks, then)
          Before I figured out that New York
          lied. Letting us think it was
          anymore special or different than
          anywhere else.

Terry ponders this over.

                    TERRY
              (tearing)
          You never loved me... I was just
          supposed to replace somebody else.

                     INES
          That’s really what you think of me?
          Go through all this, cause of that?
              (a moment)
          I loved you! I tried to tell you,
          once... but I was too scared to
          lose you! ...I never left you on a
          street corner, Terry. I’m the one
          that found you.
              (then)
          You were too young to remember, but
          I sat with you outside my shelter
          for hours. In case anyone showed
          up. Then ACS came. I heard you got
          placed in some home nearby.
              (then)
          I got locked up again... But
          couldn’t get you off my mind...
              (then)
          I am sorry, T. I just wanted to
          look out for you.

                     INES (CONT'D)
          Make sure you didn’t chewed up by
          the system like I was. Cause
          lookin’ at you, I saw myself...
          Maybe you would’ve found a better
          home. I didn’t want to take the
          chance...
              (then)
          I was lonely. And I saw someone who
          needed me... But maybe I’m the one
          who needed you. Someone to love me.
              (then)
          But I don’t want it anymore, not if
          it’s based on a lie, not if being
          loved by you or anybody else means
          not lovin’ myself.

Ines resettles in the chair, soothing some angst.

                     INES (CONT'D)
          They can call me whatever they
          want. I already know half the shit
          they gonna say and guess what, I
          still won. I WON! ‘Cause I know
          you’re gonna be somebody!
              (then)
          Whether or not anyone else wants to
          see that or see ME, I know who the
          fuck I am!

                    TERRY
          And who am I now, huh?! When was I
          supposed to get the chance to
          decide that for myself?

                    INES
          Who are you Terry? What kind of man
          did I teach you be? Somewhere deep
          down I hope you know the answer to
          that.

                     TERRY
              (choking up)
          I don’t...

Terry wipes his tears, finally beginning to relieve all
that’s tensed up inside of him.

                     TERRY (CONT'D)
          I wish I didn’t know. I wish you
          did a better job keeping that whole
          lie to yourself.
              (then)
          I wish it could’ve continued, so we
          could’ve continued. I wish...

                     TERRY (CONT'D)
              (then)
          I wish I knew how to be better to
          you, so you never felt like you had
          to leave me alone.
              (then)
          I’m scared that one day I won’t be
          able to come home anymore. One day
          I’ll show up and it’ll be like we
          never happened. Like this wasn’t
          our home, our living room.
              (then)
          I miss laying in my own bed. The
          one you made for me. Where’s home
          for me now, Ma?

Ines remains quiet as Terry stands.


INT. TERRY’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Terry gathers his own belongings.


INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Making his way out, Terry beholds Ines at peace on the couch.

                    TERRY
          ...War?

                    INES
              (not processing)
          What’s that?

He plops down beside her, then reaching over to drag the
getaway bag to their feet.


EXT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

Terry steps out first, then Ines. INES POV on A GROUP OF NEW
YOUNG WHITE NEIGHBORS, all spirited as they unload a moving
truck. Scattered below on the stoop, A FEW BLACK TENANTS.

                    FEMALE TENANT
          Cops was lookin’ for you the other
          day.

                    INES
              (stepping down)
          Them and everybody else.
                                                       122.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET – LATER

Terry and Ines let a few cars rip by. Terry then hails a cab.
As one slows down, he embraces Ines for the last time.

                    TERRY
              (still holding)
          Now who’s gonna protect you?

                    INES
              (releasing)
          You should go.

The clamor of police car sirens echo from somewhere far, off
fighting some other crime. Terry gently kisses her forehead.
She dips inside the car.


INT. TAXI CAB - CONTINUOUS

The CAB DRIVER’s already got the meter going. Through the
back window, Ines sees the young child man she raised still
standing in the street as the car moves to the light.

Cabbie gets a good look at her from the rear view mirror.

                    CAB DRIVER
          Ok, Miss where to?

She turns around, contemplating.

                                            CUT TO BLACK.
