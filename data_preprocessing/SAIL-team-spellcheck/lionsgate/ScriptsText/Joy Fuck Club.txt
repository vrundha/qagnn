EXT./ESTAB. LAFAYETTE, INDIANA - 1998 - DAY                       *
A car drives down a pretty suburban road. CHYRON: 1998.           *

INT. CAR - SAME
JOE SULLIVAN drives with his wife MARY in the passenger seat.
They’re white, pleasant-looking, in their 40s.
                      JOE SULLIVAN
          Well, Mary, I think it’s about
          time, don’t you think?
                      MARY SULLIVAN
          I think so, Joe. What about you,
          Audrey?
Mary turns around and we see her from a BACKSEAT POV. We hear
their daughter, AUDREY (age 4).
                     AUDREY (AGE 4)   (O.S.)
          Yes!
                     MARY SULLIVAN
          Okay!
                      MARY/JOE/AUDREY
          A PLAYGROUND WE WILL GO / A
          PLAYGROUND WE WILL GO / WE’LL PET A
          DOG AND SIT ON A LOG AND THEN WE’LL
          GO BACK HOME
OFF the car driving as the little family sings merrily...

EXT. PLAYGROUND - LATER
Several kids play in the sandbox and on the jungle gym as
their parents look on. Everyone is Midwestern, wholesome, corn-
fed, and white, except for...
JENNY and WEY CHEN (early 30s) approach with their daughter
LOLO (age 4). Jenny looks nervously to her husband.
                      JENNY CHEN
               (subtitled, in Mandarin)
          Look at all these white people.
                      WEY CHEN
               (subtitled, in Mandarin)
          I’ve never seen so many of them in
          one place before. It’s like a bar
          that has board games.
                      JENNY CHEN
               (subtitled, in Mandarin)
          Or an episode of Friends.
                                                          2.

                      WEY CHEN
               (subtitled, in Mandarin)
          Indiana is like one giant episode
          of Friends.
Lolo tugs at her Mom’s pant leg.
                      LOLO (AGE 4)
               (subtitled, in Mandarin)
          I’m going to make a sandcastle!
Lolo runs to the sandbox and starts digging with her toy pail
and shovel. A little BOY comes up to her.
                      BOY
          Ching chong ching chong choo!
Lolo SLUGS him. The Boy yelps, rushing off to find his mother.
The Chens look down at Lolo.
                     JENNY CHEN
          Lolo...
                      LOLO (AGE 4)
          I know, I know. Sorry.
Jenny and Wey can’t help but smile at their feisty daughter,
then look up as Joe and Mary Sullivan approach.
                      JOE SULLIVAN
          Hey there. You must be new in town!
                      JENNY CHEN
          Sorry, are you the parents of that
          racist boy?
                      MARY SULLIVAN
          Oh no. Just curious: Are you
          Chinese?
                     WEY CHEN
               (warily, “here we go”)
          Yes...
                      JOE SULLIVAN
          Great! Do you mind if our daughter
          plays with your daughter?
                      JENNY CHEN
          Why our daughter?
                      MARY SULLIVAN
          Well... we thought Audrey might
          like to meet her.
The Sullivans coax their daughter out from hiding behind them.
It turns out Audrey, whose voice we heard earlier, is also
Asian! Audrey’s eyes go wide at the sight of Lolo.
                                                          3.

                      AUDREY (AGE 4)
                (shyly)
          Hi.
                      LOLO (AGE 4)
          Hi, I’m Lolo, I’m four. Wanna play
          sandcastle?
Audrey nods, yes. As the girls play...
BEGIN STYLIZED MUSIC MONTAGE OF THE GIRLS GROWING UP:
- The Chens and Sullivans send Audrey and Lolo to preschool,
where they stand out amid their white classmates. Audrey looks
a little scared until rambunctious Lolo grabs her hand and
they head in, smiling.
- Audrey and Lolo, now in grade school, stand among a group of   *
GIRL SCOUTS. Audrey’s uniform is perfect and her sash displays   *
DOZENS of badges; her TROOP LEADER hands her another one and     *
Audrey’s face lights up. Meanwhile, Lolo has no badges, eats     *
straight out of a box of Thin Mints, and wipes her chocolatey    *
fingertips on her uniform between bites.                         *
- A ROAST HAM HITS THE TABLE. WIDER to see the Sullivans
hosting the Chens for Christmas. Perfect table settings, super
civilized. Audrey wears a cute J Crew dress; Lolo wears an
oversize Champion t-shirt. The Sullivans say grace.
- A ROAST DUCK HITS THE TABLE. WIDER to see the Chens hosting
the Sullivans for Chinese New Year. The extended Chen clan is
there (including Lolo’s weird, unblinking cousin DEADEYE, 10),
diving into the food in a mad scramble. Lolo and her mother
are in matching qipaos. Audrey looks wistfully at how much
they look alike. Then she shakes it off and wraps an arm
around her mom, Mary. Mary beams.
- High school. On a sign: “AUDREY FOR PRESIDENT!”. Audrey, 17,
hands out stickers to classmates in the hall. Nearby, Lolo,
17, stands under a sign: “SENIOR ART SHOW”. She proudly
displays a weird photograph of a cat that’s been altered with    *
splotches of paint, feathers, yarn, etc. People walking by       *
avert their eyes, disturbed.                                     *
- FLASH! Audrey, 21, in college has her picture taken as she
receives a Top Scholar Award. More FLASHES as she receives
various accolades: Student Bar Association! Captain of the       *
Crew Team! President of Chinese Students Association (with her   *
co-president, KAREN. We’ll see more of her later).
- FLASH! Lolo, 21, nude and smeared with colorful paint, poses
for an aggressively artsy photo. WIDEN TO REVEAL it was taken
by a camera on a timer against a hastily-hung background.
After a moment, Lolo’s mom Jenny enters with a laundry basket
and tears down the background, revealing the washing machine
behind it. She and Lolo get into an argument.                    *
END SEQUENCE.
                                                          4.

CHYRON: “2021”

INT. WINSTON FREED & ASSOCIATES - NIGHT
Big giant law firm, dead of night. Silent and dark, except for
a crack of light under one closed office door. We hear a faint
PHONE ALARM...

INT. AUDREY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Multiple framed degrees and certificates hang on the walls of
this immaculately-kept office, and a long line of AWARDS are
neatly displayed on a shelf. On the desk, a name plate that
reads “AUDREY HAN SULLIVAN” and photos of Audrey and her         *
parents.                                                         *
UNDER THE DESK - curled up on the floor: AUDREY, now 27, is
asleep in her work clothes. That is, until she finally hears
her phone alarm. She grabs the phone and silences it. She        *
emerges from under the desk, shakes off the grogginess, and
sits back in her chair, all business. Back to work!
QUICK CUTS of Audrey working:
4AM: Audrey’s on a video call with a client in Berlin.
                      AUDREY (INTO PHONE)
          --Guten Tag, Fraulein Lingenfelter?
          I updated the Disclosure Schedules
          ahead of schedule. They’re good to
          go--
7AM: A chipper Audrey greets a groggy associate, BECKETT, who
has just come in.
                      AUDREY (CONT'D)
          Beckett! I went over your Blitz.com
          file-- some references were off, I
          went ahead and fixed them for you.
          Love the jacket, by the way, I’m
          gonna get another coffee, you want?
          You look like you want.
She hands bleary Beckett the file as she exits.
10AM: In a conference room, Audrey and a senior partner, FRANK
(white, 50s, Midwestern), meet with CLIENTS:                     *
                      AUDREY (CONT'D)
          ...We'll push back on some of these
          terms-- they're way off-market.
                                                          5.

                      CLIENT
               (worried)
          Yes, but the Japanese firms have
          considerable capital, we don’t want
          to lose out--
                      FRANK
          I agree with Audrey, it’s worth a                      *
          shot. She’s obviously an expert on                     *
          Asian markets.                                         *
Audrey looks panicked for a split second-- she’s not an          *
expert, actually-- but then recovers and smiles, too used to     *
microaggressions like this to be offended. She nods, happy for   *
Frank’s approval.                                                *

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY (LATER)
Glasses CLINK as Frank pours champagne for Audrey and a few
ASSOCIATES.
                      FRANK
          Congratulations, team, on closing
          Heartland Poultry! Big shout-out to
          Audrey for taking the lead!
Everyone cheers. Frank comes over to Audrey.
                      FRANK (CONT'D)
          Now that this is done you can roll
          onto the WestStar deal.
                      AUDREY
          Actually, I’m not going to be on
          that one. I’m leaving on vacation
          tonight--
               (off his disappointment;
                quickly)
          Only because HR said I had to since
          I'm 600 hours over.
                      FRANK
          Right. Just too bad it’s happening
          at crunch time for us. You know, I
          shouldn’t be telling you this, but--
               (confiding)
          --I’m planning on backing you for
          partner.
Audrey is stunned, delighted.
                      FRANK (CONT'D)
               (passive aggressive)
          But this vacation throws a wrench
          into things. Where are you going
          again?
                                                          6.

                     AUDREY
          Beijing.                                              *
                      FRANK
          Ah, China, isn’t that where you’re                    *
          from?                                                 *
                      AUDREY                                    *
          Well, I was born there, but I’m                       *
          from Indiana.                                         *
                      FRANK                                     *
          Right, right. Chinese food is tough                   *
          for me. Too many flavors.                             *
Audrey lets this comment roll right over her.                   *
                      AUDREY                                    *
          I’ll be back before you know it.                      *
          While I’m in China I can get even                     *
          more familiar with Asian markets.                     *
          And with regards to WestStar, I’m                     *
          back the day before the pitch.
               (wants to be team player)
          I can still lead the team, I’ll
          just prep while I’m in Beijing.
                      FRANK
          All right, you’re on. That’s future
          partner attitude. I love it.
Audrey beams.                                                   *
                      AUDREY
          You can always count on me to
          positively represent the firm--
                      LOLO (O.S.)
          Heeeeeyyyyy Bitch!!!
Audrey and Frank turn to see LOLO, 27, entering, in an outfit
somehow tight and raggedy at the same time, and slept-in eye
makeup. Audrey is surprised, a little embarrassed.
                      LOLO (CONT'D)
          Who’s ready to vacay?!
               (sees Frank)
          Hello lawyer.
               (sees everyone else)                             *
          Lawyers.                                              *
Audrey looks apologetically at Frank; good thing he’s merely
amused (and probably staring at Lolo’s booty shorts).
                                                             7.

INT. LOLO’S CAR - EVENING
In contrast to Audrey’s ultra-together vibe, Lolo is a hot
mess and doesn’t give a shit. Her car is filled with
photography equipment, paint cans, spools of yarn, wood           *
blocks, empty Cheetos bags and water bottles. She bounces         *
along to a track by Dumbfoundead as she drives.
                      AUDREY
          You should have given me a heads up
          you were coming.
                      LOLO
          I wanted to make sure your ass left
          work. You realize we haven’t taken
          a trip since you started this job?!                     *
          Pro tip for Beijing: try all the                        *
          wack fruits, they’re delicious. And                     *
          we gotta hit up a night market and                      *
          get jianbing, it’s basically like a                     *
          Chinese pancake-- what are you                          *
          doing?
Audrey doesn’t answer, immersed in a work file. Lolo grabs it
and chucks it in the back.
                     AUDREY
          Hey?!
                      LOLO
          That’s work. I could see it on your
          face, you had workface.
                      AUDREY
          I just have to read this one thing.
          It’s a crazy time for the firm-
                      LOLO
          Boo-boo, it’s always a crazy time.
          We’re on VACATION.                                      *
Audrey reaches back to get her work file, then sees amongst       *
the clutter in the backseat a large framed photo of a             *
cornfield splotched with paint, yarn strewn over it, etc. It’s    *
got a messy, cool vibe to it.                                     *
                      AUDREY                                      *
          Hey, is this the one Cafe Zola let                      *
          you hang? Nobody bought it?                             *
                      LOLO                                        *
          Yeah, they said the customers                           *
          thought it was too distracting.                         *
                      AUDREY                                      *
          Distracting is good, that’s what                        *
          art is! They’re idiots!                                 *
                                                             8.

                      LOLO                                        *
          Yeah I already fucked up their Yelp                     *
          page.                                                   *
Lolo notices that Audrey is looking back at her work file.        *
                      LOLO (CONT'D)
          Hey. HEY! Stop thinking about work!                     *
          Don’t make me ear flick you--
Lolo starts ear flicking Audrey. Audrey tries to fend her off,
laughing.

              LOLO (CONT'D)                  AUDREY
 Ya like that? Ya like that,     Stop! Fine, I’ll just work
 ya workaholic idiot!            tonight! Keep your hands on
                                 the wheel, Jesus! You psycho!

Audrey and Lolo sit with their parents, it’s an informal
dinner. Audrey’s mother dramatically unveils a beautiful,
homemade cake with “BON VOYAGE” written on top.
                      AUDREY
          Aw, you didn’t have to do that!                         *
                      MARY SULLIVAN                               *
          Of course we did, we want to                            *
          celebrate you! It’s a big deal,                         *
          going to your birth country.                            *
                      AUDREY                                      *
          It’s not, it’s just a vacation.                         *
          Plus Karen’s been hounding me to                        *
          come visit her ever since she got                       *
          engaged, so...                                          *
                      JOE SULLIVAN                                *
          Well, it’s a well-deserved                              *
          vacation. You work so hard.                             *
                      WEY CHEN                                    *
               (to Lolo)                                          *
          You hear that? She works hard. You                      *
          should try it sometime.                                 *
Lolo rolls her eyes: she’s heard this before. Jenny quickly       *
steps in to change the subject.                                   *
                      JENNY CHEN                                  *
          So Audrey, how do you like your new                     *
          place in Chicago?                                       *

                      AUDREY                            *
          It’s nice! It’s small, but it’s               *
          good to have my own space.                    *
                      LOLO                              *
          She’s being modest, bitch has an in-          *
          unit washer dryer!                            *
               (to Audrey)                              *
          Your rent must be stupid high, what           *
          is it?                                        *
                      AUDREY                            *
          It’s not that bad.                            *
                      WEY CHEN                          *
          Well, congratulations, Audrey.                *
          Maybe you can convince Lolo to move           *
          out too.                                      *
                      LOLO                              *
          Why would I move out, I have an in-           *
          unit washer dryer at home!                    *
Everyone laughs, but Lolo’s parents keep poking.        *
                      WEY CHEN                          *
          You know, my co-worker’s daughter             *
          just got into school to become a              *
          dental hygienist.                             *

          I’m an artist, Dad.                           *
                      JENNY CHEN                        *
          Then you should apply to art school           *
          somewhere.                                    *

          I don’t need to waste money on an             *

          Then you should make money. Doing             *

          If I want to make money, I’ll start           *
          an OnlyFans, how about that?                  *
                      JENNY CHEN                        *
          You’d never make it on OnlyFans.              *
          You’re no Asa Akira.                          *

Mary brings out a box.                                           *
                      MARY SULLIVAN
          So, I thought it would be fun to
          see some pictures of Audrey the                        *
          last time she was in China!                            *
                      AUDREY
          Oh, the Chens don’t want to--
But Mary is already passing out photos of baby Audrey in China
being carried by a young Joe and Mary.
                      MARY SULLIVAN
          Wasn’t she precious? This one’s the
          first time I ever held her-- oh my
          god, I’m going to cry...
                      JOE SULLIVAN
          Oh, honey. Me too!
                      LOLO
               (looking at pics)
          Heh, you had a big old head.
          Adorable Chinese pumpkin baby.
Audrey rifles absently through the box, which also holds old     *
keepsakes: folders, random paperwork, mostly in Chinese.
Then she sees the edge of something sticking out of the box
lining. It must have gotten stuck there. She pulls it
out...it’s a faded photo of a YOUNG ASIAN WOMAN in a hospital
gown, holding a newborn Audrey. The woman’s hair hides half
her face; the other half is obscured by shadows. Audrey feels
her breath catch... she turns the picture over to see her
birthdate and the words “Birth Mother.” Mary notices.
                      MARY SULLIVAN
          Oh! I thought we lost that picture--
                        LOLO
          Who’s that?
                      MARY SULLIVAN
          Audrey’s birth mother. It’s the
          only picture they had.
                        LOLO
          Wow.
                      AUDREY
          I’ve never seen this before. It was
          stuck to the side.
                      MARY SULLIVAN
          Look at her. So young. I wish we
          could see her face better, I’m sure
          she was beautiful, just like you.
                                                           11.

Audrey is overwhelmed from seeing the picture; she quickly       *
puts it aside.                                                   *
                      AUDREY                                     *
          Not as beautiful as you though!                        *
                      MARY SULLIVAN                              *
          Stop, honey, you’re such a                             *
          sweetheart, okay I’m crying                            *
          again...                                               *
Joe puts an arm around her; she dabs at her eyes; Audrey         *
smiles at them both. This trio fucking loves each other. Lolo    *
takes a picture of the birth mom photo.                          *
                      LOLO
          Remember we used to guess who your
          biological mom was? My money was on
          Lucy Liu, ‘cause she was the only
          Chinese person on TV.
Audrey is uncomfortable with the topic of her birth mother.
She puts the picture away:
                      AUDREY
          Ha. Yeah. That was stupid.
               (then)
          More cake, anyone?
It’s clear Audrey wants to move on, but Lolo studies the
picture of Audrey’s birth mom.                                   *
                      LOLO
          No offense, but...would bang.

EXT. LAX - DAY (ESTABLISHING)

INT. LAX - INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - DAY
Audrey sits in a bustling terminal. She messages her parents:
“Layover in LA! Boarding soon! (string of heart emojis)”. She    *
gets back to working on her laptop when Lolo collapses in the
seat next to her.
                      LOLO
          I tried sneaking into the lounge,                      *
          but that was a fail. Told them my
          name was Business McBusinessWoman,
          they were... not amused.
Lolo looks over Audrey’s shoulder
                      LOLO (CONT'D)
          Ugh, stop WORKING! You’re such a
          Lawyer McLawyerlaw--

          --whatever. Hey. Check this out.                      *
Lolo shows her phone to Audrey - it’s the photo of Audrey’s     *
birth mom, but painted over in an artsy way.                    *
                      AUDREY                                    *
          Oh. That’s... interesting.                            *

          It’s cool that you actually know                      *
          what she looks like now, right?                       *

          Hey, now that we’re going to China,                   *
          maybe we could look for her. Is                       *
          that crazy?                                           *

          What? We’re not doing that. There                     *
          are a billion people in China, the
          odds are basically zero.
                      LOLO
          The odds aren’t zero. You have a                      *
          picture now and the name of the                       *

Lolo taps on her phone, showing youtube videos of adult Asian   *
adoptees reuniting with relatives in their home countries.

          Greetings.                                             *
Audrey recoils to see DEADEYE, 28, who’s appeared next to her.
Wearing an “It’s an Honor Just to be Asian” shirt, a fanny
pack and lots of eye-liner, she’s specific AF. With her flat
voice and blank stare, Deadeye is an apt name.
                      LOLO
               (lights up)
          Deadeye, you made it! Audrey, you
          remember my cousin?
Audrey does, it’s not a good memory. Deadeye, who doesn’t
blink or smile, stares at Audrey, who looks uncomfortable.
                      AUDREY
          Yeah, you visited when we were
          twelve. I remember you used to                         *
          snort Fun Dip.                                         *
                      DEADEYE
          Still do. My favorite flavor is                        *
          green.                                                 *
She matter-of-factly takes out some Fun Dip and snorts it.       *

          Lolo said you guys were going to be                    *
          in Beijing and I was planning to                       *
          visit Nai Nai anyway, so I decided                     *
          to come with.                                          *

          Okaaay. Could you give us a second?                    *
Audrey pulls Lolo aside:
                      AUDREY (CONT'D)
          What the hell? You told Deadeye                        *
          about our trip?                                        *

          Yeah, her parents asked my parents                     *
          if she could come with. I wasn’t
          sure she was even gonna show! Look,
          she doesn’t have a lot of friends--
ANGLE ON Deadeye, talking to a random child.
                       DEADEYE
          Greetings.
The child’s parent grabs the kid away from Deadeye.

          C’mon, she’s family, it’s fine!                         *
Audrey sighs, doesn’t love it, but concedes. They head back to
Deadeye.
                      LOLO (CONT'D)
               (to Deadeye and Audrey)

          There’s a lotta dried squid in

Deadeye pulls something out of her fanny pack.
                      DEADEYE
          Would anyone like a glow stick for
          the flight.
                       AUDREY
          Why?
                      DEADEYE
          Just to hold and enjoy.
                      LOLO
               (makes sense to her)
          Yeah, sure!
Lolo and Deadeye cheerfully break their glow sticks which
light up. Audrey has no idea how to react. Lolo checks
Deadeye’s boarding pass.
                      LOLO (CONT'D)
          Cool, you guys are sitting next to
          each other! C’mon, we’re boarding!

          How do you know all this?
                      LOLO
          I dunno. It’s kinda like how you

          Don’t say anything about her

          Thanks again for having us and
          making extra accommodations.
                      KAREN
          No trouble, I have plenty of guest
          rooms.

She and Audrey are wide-eyed as Karen leads them through the     *
club, which has oversized chandeliers and MODEL WAITSTAFF        *
ferrying silver buckets of champagne to Beijing’s colorful

          Right?
               (then)
          Let’s get a picture!                                   *
Karen takes a group selfie, checks it. Sees Deadeye’s face.      *
                      KAREN (CONT'D)
          Not everyone is smiling, redo!
               (sees Deadeye’s look)
          Nevermind. Ooh, Clarence is here,                      *
          he just texted!                                        *

          There he is!                                           *
Karen waves at CLARENCE, 30, who is wending his way towards      *
them. The crowd looks like it’s almost magically...parting for   *
him? Because HOLY SHIT: this dude is the hottest piece of ass    *
in the Middle Kingdom (think Harry Shum, Jr.). He’s so good-     *
looking, it’s distracting.                                       *
                      LOLO                                       *
               (low, to Audrey)                                  *
          Why does she get to fuck this guy?                     *
          This is so unfair.                                     *
Clarence arrives at their booth and Karen slips her hand into    *
his. He raises it to his lips and kisses it, looking lovingly    *
at Karen the whole time. Lolo can’t believe this shit.           *
                      AUDREY                                     *
               (to Karen)
          So! Tell us about the TV show
          you’re on.                                             *

                      KAREN
          Oh, stop, you’re too kind. But yes,                   *
          it’s called Unit 8, I play Chunhwa,                   *
          the good girl. I was the good girl
          on my last two dramas, too. It’s
          kind of my brand.
                      CLARENCE
          It’s what drew me to her. She’s as
          pure and beautiful on the inside as
          she is on the outside.
Audrey reacts surprised, pure? Clarence and Karen nuzzle.
Lolo, still thirsting after Clarence, pours herself an entire   *
glass of vodka, then sees Karen looking at her, judgy.          *
                      LOLO
          Did you want some?
                      KAREN
          Oh, we don’t drink.
                      CLARENCE
          We just get high on Jesus.
                      LOLO
          HAHAHAHA!

          Oh, you’re not joking...
                      KAREN
               (hurriedly)
          Why would we joke about that?
          Audrey, that was one of the first
          things I told you when we met,
          remember? That I was a good,
          Christian girl saving myself for
          marriage?
                      AUDREY
               (confused)
          Did you...?
                      LOLO
          So you guys have never had sex--
                      KAREN
               (quickly)
          Our connection is based on
          spiritual, not physical intimacy.
                      LOLO
          Did you have a spiritual connection
          with Andy Roddick’s taint?

Karen glares at Lolo, but it all goes over Clarence’s head.
                      CLARENCE
          You girls are so funny. I love when
          old friends get together, they
          always have inside jokes no one
          else would get.
                      KAREN
          Darling, maybe you should get some
          air.
               (to girls, re: Lolo’s

          If he gets too close to alcohol his
          skin gets itchy.
                      CLARENCE
          My dewdrop. Always thinking of me.
          I am a little itchy, actually.
He gets up and takes off his sweater, his T-shirt riding up
to show a perfect six-pack. Lolo’s mouth falls open. Clarence
pecks Karen on the cheek and exits. Lolo turns to Karen:
                      LOLO
          How are you not fucking that?!
                      KAREN
          You’re being vulgar. Also it’s none
          of your business.
                      LOLO
          You’re right, I apologize.
               (beat)
          So has Clarence ever seen your
          pussy tat?
Audrey chokes on her drink. Deadeye calmly eats a dumpling.     *
                      KAREN
          It’s gone. Lasers can work
          miracles. Lasers and prayer. Gone.
                      LOLO
          Prove it.
                      KAREN

          Yolo Lolo. I used to be a bit of a                    *
          mess like you... but I grew out of                    *
          it.
This stings Lolo, but she quickly recovers.

          I like this song.                                      *
Deadeye stands up in her seat and begins a weird dance with      *
her arms in front of her like a cat. OFF Lolo, angrily looking   *
at Karen and Audrey having a great time on the dance floor.      *

INT./EXT. BEIJING - VARIOUS
We see a MINI-MONTAGE of the girls enjoying Beijing:
TEMPLE: Audrey and Karen, arm-in-arm, walk the peaceful          *
grounds as Lolo takes photos of the temple and garden.           *
Deadeye, lagging behind everyone, has earbuds in and is          *
listening to BTS.                                                *
MUSEUM: Audrey and Karen walk up to the ticket booth as Lolo     *
scrounges in her bag for cash. Deadeye, earbuds in, listening    *
to Girls’ Generation, ends up buying her ticket for her.         *
HIGH-END BOUTIQUE: Audrey and Karen happily shop for bags.
Lolo checks a price tag and recoils. She sullenly goes to sit    *
down next to Deadeye, who is listening to After School.          *
KAREN’S HOUSE: Lolo lies around, bored, as Audrey works on her   *
laptop. Karen enters and surprises Audrey with a gift-- she’s    *
bought her one of the bags! Deadeye has earbuds in and is
listening to Blackpink.
Off Lolo, feeling left out...

EXT. INDUSTRIAL PARK - DAY
Lolo leads the group as they walk through a painfully generic    *
industrial park. Audrey and Karen look around, unsure what
they’re doing there.
                      LOLO
          Just down this way!
Audrey looks at Deadeye, who’s still got her earbuds in.
                      AUDREY
          What are you listening to?
                      DEADEYE
          BTS. I’m proud ARMY. I would let RM                    *
          and Suga spitroast me while                            *
          Jungkook filmed it with one hand                       *
          and jerked off Jimin with the                          *
          other. No disrespect to the other                      *
          three.                                                 *
On Audrey, okay then. She calls to Lolo.                         *

                      LOLO
          Listen, we’ve been doing Karen’s
          itinerary this whole time. And it’s
          been great-- I stole two robes from
          the Mandarin hotel spa. But you
          should also see the real Beijing,

          We’re in a business park.

          Here it is!
Lolo turns the corner, gestures to a sign on one of the
offices: “Gladwell Adoption Services.”
                        AUDREY
          What?
Deadeye, seeing the sign, finally takes out her earbuds.
                      DEADEYE
          Interesting.
                      LOLO
          This is the agency that handled
          your adoption. So you can finally
          find your birth mom!

          Remember in fourth grade when we                       *
          had to draw family trees and you
          put Mary and Joe, but you also left
          a branch open for your birth mom? I
          know you think about her.
                      AUDREY
          Thinking about her doesn’t mean I
          was trying to find her...
                      LOLO
          Yeah, but we’re here! You’re back
          in China for the first time since
          you were a baby. Aren’t you
          curious? Like, where is she now?
          What does she do? What’s her name,
          even?                                                  *
Lolo holds up her phone, showing the picture of Audrey’s birth
mom. Audrey finally sighs, relenting to Lolo’s enthusiasm.       *
                      AUDREY                                     *
          Okay, I guess it can’t hurt.
          They’ll either know or they won’t,
          right? And then we can move on.
                     LOLO
          Right!
As they head in...

Lolo sighs, shakes her head; Karen is so lame.

it into her computer.

          adoption happened before everything                    *
          was digitized, so I don’t have much                    *

          file number and whether your birth                     *

          once I get to Chicago. But here...                     *
Karen ever so subtly tips her head towards a few people down     *
the street; they’re pretending to take a photo, but it’s         *
clearly to get Karen in the background.                          *

Karen puts an arm around Audrey and they begin to walk away as   *
Lolo looks on, scowling. As they pass the giggling fans who      *
were taking a stealth pic of Karen:                              *

The fans eyes’ widen, horrified that someone insulted their      *
idol, and raise their phones to film Lolo, who flips them off    *
as she walks away.                                               *

EXT. KAREN’S TOWNHOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY (NEXT MORNING)           *
Audrey, Lolo, and Deadeye are putting overnight bags into a      *
black Escalade with the help of the driver, ARTHUR (think        *
Jimmy O. Yang). Clarence and Karen emerge; Clarence is holding   *
a GIANT fucking Louis Vuitton suitcase.                          *

She glances over at Lolo; she’s playing it just the slightest    *
bit sultry, on purpose. Lolo rolls her eyes, Karen leans in to   *
give Clarence a kiss...and he beats her to it, pecking her       *
ever so lightly on the lips.                                     *

          Of course. I’ll have car service in                     *
          Chicago too, so get used to this                        *
          kind of luxury when we’re hanging                       *
          out ALL THE TIME!                                       *
Lolo’s eyes narrow. Deadeye puts in her headphones.               *

          Let me know if my music is too                          *
          loud.                                                   *
Deadeye closes her eyes. The music is pounding out of her         *
headphones.                                                       *

          Is that-- how does she sleep                            *
          through that?                                           *
Everyone shrugs. Arthur turns back to Karen.                      *
                      ARTHUR                                      *
          Miss Karen, I am a big fan of your                      *
          show. I never miss an episode.                          *

          about your favorites!!!                                 *
Lolo looks like she’s about to murder/suicide someone.            *

The car drives along. Karen is now sitting in the passenger       *
seat, next to Arthur.                                             *

          And then last season, when Rocky                        *
          betrayed you at your sister’s                           *
          wedding?! So good!                                      *

          Aww, thank you, Arthur! You’re too                      *
          sweet.                                                  *
As Karen continues chatting pleasantly with Arthur, Lolo          *
watches them, whispering to Audrey and Karen.                     *

          She’s gotta have set this whole                         *

          It’s just such a coincidence that                       *
          the driver is a huge fan of hers.                       *

          fans.                                                   *
In the front of the car, Arthur is still excitedly fanboying      *
to Karen about the show.                                          *

          ...Chunhwa should not be with Rocky                     *
          anyway. You went to medical school,                     *
          you could have been a doctor. Qiang                     *
          was a better choice!                                    *
                      KAREN                                       *
          Wow, Qiang was from Season 1! You                       *
          really know the show!                                   *

          It’s my favorite. In fact...                            *
Arthur lifts up a sleeve to reveal that he has a tattoo of her    *
character Chunhwa’s face on his wrist.                            *
                      ARTHUR (CONT'D)                             *
          I am such a big fan, I got a                            *
          “Chunhwa” tattoo.                                       *
In the backseat, the others register this: WTF? Karen pats        *
Arthur on the hand.                                               *

          I love it, Arthur.                                      *
Arthur beams, stares in awe at the hand Karen touched.            *

          Of course, Chunhwa.                                     *
Lolo and Deadeye clock this and exchange a glance. Weird.         *

An empty stretch of road. As Arthur drives, PAN over everyone   *
sleeping. In the back seat, Deadeye is snoring loudly even as   *
music blasts from her headphones. Audrey is finally taking a    *
break from her laptop and work files. Lolo is drooling, her     *
phone propped up, mid-text. In the passenger seat, Karen is     *
also asleep, but as the camera gets closer, she senses          *
something in front of her face.                                 *
She opens her eyes to see Arthur STARING OVER HER.              *

Karen lunges for the wheel. A scuffle ensues as everyone          *

handbag, one SWIFT, HARD HIT. He’s instantly out, falling         *

control. As everyone screams, Karen finally is able to            *

the brake, but she can only slow the car down a little before     *

Arthur stirs again, this time with a groan. The girls look to   *
each other and start rapidly walking away.                      *

Hours later. The girls, hot and cranky, looking bedraggled,     *
haul their stuff down the road. Audrey looks around at the      *
desolate scene as she listlessly holds up a hitchhiking hand.   *

          him. I’ll make it work.                                *
                      FRANK (ON ZOOM)                            *
          Audrey, I-- what’s going on in the                     *
          background there?                                      *
Behind Audrey, two of the shirtless basketball players are       *
horsing around, throwing a mini basketball.                      *
                      AUDREY                                     *
          Oh, uh, nothing--                                      *
Suddenly, we hear a loud noise coming from outside the bus.      *
                      FRANK                                      *
          What’s that? Are those sirens?                         *
Yes they are-- SIRENS BLARE as a police car appears behind the   *
bus, pulling it over.                                            *
                                                         50.

Just then, one of the shirtless basketball players behind        *
Audrey pantses the other, revealing his BUTT right in the Zoom   *
frame.                                                           *
                      FRANK (CONT'D)                             *
          Is that a butt?! What is going on--                    *
                      AUDREY                                     *
               (frantic)                                         *
          I think the wifi on this bus is                        *
          about to go out I’ll have to catch                     *
          you later Frank! Thanks!                               *
She shuts the zoom window. The police sirens continue as the     *
bus driver pulls over, opens his door, and begins talking in     *
Mandarin to a couple of POLICE OFFICERS who have approached      *
the door and are standing outside. Audrey turns to Karen and     *
Deadeye.                                                         *
                      AUDREY (CONT'D)                            *
          Is this about Arthur?                                  *
                      KAREN                                      *
          Yes, the cops found him.                               *
               (listening)                                       *
          Oh shit.                                               *
Karen and Deadeye share a look of concern as they listen in on   *
the conversation in Mandarin.                                    *
                      DEADEYE                                    *
          You never should’ve called the                         *
          police.                                                *
                      KAREN                                      *
          I didn’t want to, but--                                *
Karen doesn’t want to say it’s Audrey’s fault.                   *
                      AUDREY                                     *
          What’s happening??                                     *
                      DEADEYE                                    *
          Apparently Arthur is the son of a                      *
          government official. He told the                       *
          cops the actress who plays Chunhwa                     *
          and three of her friends attacked                      *
          him and left him for dead.                             *
                     AUDREY                                      *
          What?!                                                 *
                      KAREN                                      *
          They want to bring us in for                           *
          questioning.                                           *

ANGLE ON one of the police officers ascending the bus steps.     *
He’s a huge, scary-looking man with Khal Drogo vibes. The        *
girls all reflexively duck down.                                 *

Audrey, Deadeye, and Karen run for the bathroom in the back--    *

Lolo, propped up high against the wall, legs wrapped around      *
Stephon Marbury’s face.                                          *

Karen is left outside as the bathroom door slams shut. As the    *
Police Officer steps onto the bus, Karen is going to be caught   *
until Todd suddenly grabs her and covers her with a blanket.     *
Karen is left with her face in Todd’s lap. The Police Officer    *
steps up, addresses the bus.                                     *

She reaches below frame, making heavy eye contact with him,      *
and they start making out furiously again. Audrey and Deadeye    *
both squirm, trying to avert their eyes. Audrey uncomfortably    *
looks towards the ceiling, only to see Lolo’s camera mounted     *
on the wall and pointing down at them.                           *

The Police Officer is now having a conversation with Todd as     *
Karen tries hard not to move... which is difficult given that    *
she’s sweating under a blanket, in the lap of an ex-boyfriend.   *
                      POLICE OFFICER                             *

The Police Officer smiles thinly, then looks around.             *

The Officer turns to go. Under the blanket, Karen can’t hold     *
it in any longer. She SNEEZES. The Officer whips back around.    *

                      POLICE OFFICER                             *
          Is your lap cold, captain?                             *

          Yes, I like to balance being                            *
          shirtless with a warm lower body.                       *
It’s stifling under the blanket. Karen can’t help but fidget.     *
                      POLICE OFFICER                              *
          Captain, I think you’re hiding                          *
          someone under there.                                    *
The Police Officer reaches for the blanket...AND SUDDENLY,        *
FROM THE BATHROOM, Marbury steps out, in his tighty-whiteys,      *
his arms behind him.                                              *
                      STEPHON MARBURY                             *
               (uber-polite)                                      *
          Excuse me Officer, is there a                           *
          problem--                                               *
And suddenly he whips Lolo’s camera out from behind his back      *
and snaps a picture, unleashing a BRIGHT FLASH which              *
temporarily blinds the officer.                                   *
                       POLICE OFFICER                             *
          Aaaa!                                                   *
Marbury drops Lolo’s camera, then charges down the aisle,         *
grabbing the Officer’s cap as he rushes out the door.             *
                     POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)                      *
               (high-pitched)                                     *
          My hat!                                                 *
The Officer runs after Marbury, allowing the girls to burst       *
out of the bathroom (and Karen to emerge from Todd’s lap).        *
Lolo puts her camera around her neck, points at the skylight.     *
                       LOLO                                       *
          Let’s go!                                               *
Todd helps the girls as they start climbing out of the raised     *
skylight. As soon as they’re all up, Karen turns and kisses       *
Todd on the cheek.                                                *

EXT. CBA BUS / EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS                          *
The girls climb out of the skylight and onto the roof of the      *
bus. Freedom! In the background, Stephon Marbury runs down the    *
highway as the Officer chases. As the other Officer in the car    *
calls for backup, the girls climb down a ladder from the roof     *
of the bus and start running down a side road.                    *

Karen and Lolo start shouting at each other as Audrey tries to    *
get in the middle.                                                *

          Stop it! Stop fighting!                                 *
Finally, Deadeye whistles loudly, getting all their attention.    *
She holds up her phone.                                           *

          Grandma called. They sent our                           *
          cousin Deng to come get us. He’s                        *
          already at the bridge in town.                          *
Deadeye points into the village.                                  *
                      DEADEYE (CONT'D)                            *

          Are you coming.                                         *
Deadeye looks to Audrey and Karen. Karen looks uncertain.         *

EXT. RURAL VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER                               *
The girls walk through an idyllic water town. Ancient            *
buildings and shops line the streets.                            *

          It’s an historic Chinese water                         *
          town. It runs completely off                           *
          hydroelectric power.                                   *

          We went to a water town once with                      *
          the family years ago. There are a                      *
          lot of them near Nai Nai’s.                            *

          happening right now!                                   *
Several people carrying a red, ornate bridal sedan chair march   *
past as onlookers gather to catch a glimpse of the bride in      *
her traditional red gown.                                        *

          Xitang is also a water town. Your                      *
          mom probably grew up in a place                        *
          like this.                                             *
Audrey reacts at the mention of her “mom”... She looks around    *
at the charming and colorful town, at the Chinese families, at   *
a cute young mom and her daughter - she’s starting to warm to    *
the idea of connecting with her roots/mom... when a scary        *
SNORTING WATER BUFFALO snaps her out of it -- it’s one of many   *
being herded by a gruff man towards the river.                   *

          here, just dialect. But you sounded                    *
          good there, the accent was good!                       *

          The bridge is this way. I think                        *
          Deng’s just on the other side.                         *
They turn the corner, only to see...                             *

EXT. BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER                                      *
A flooded bridge. Muddy river water has completely wiped out     *
the road. Fuck. A faraway figure waves from the other side of    *
the river. It’s DENG. Deadeye looks up from her texts.           *
                      DEADEYE                                    *
          That’s Deng. He can’t get across.                      *
          He says we have to wait until the                      *
          water recedes.                                         *

          I don’t know. At least several                         *
          hours. Maybe a day or two.                             *

Audrey looks to the river, then back at the shore, where there   *
is a boathouse nearby. She points to several dragonboats         *
outside.                                                         *

          Alright...                                             *
The girls approach a boat. Audrey grabs the waterproof boat      *
bag and sticks her adoption file in it along with everyone’s     *
phones and her laptop; at the last second, Lolo manages to       *
cram her camera in there as well. Audrey starts barking          *
directions.                                                      *

          Okay. Hands on! That’s a crew term                     *
          for “grab it”. Now, let’s walk it                      *
          forward!                                               *
On the shore, they see a MAN emerge past the boathouse, waving   *
at them from afar.                                               *

          We’re just renting the boat!                           *
Karen waves some money and puts it into a collection box near    *
the boathouse. The girls push the boat onto the water as the     *
man continues yelling at them in local dialect, waving,          *
pointing at his watch, almost as if he’s warning them not to     *
get on the water right now...                                    *

EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS                                          *
The gang sets out across the river. Audrey is in the back,       *
shouting directions as they paddle.                              *

they get there, Audrey shouts out a command.                     *

Everyone stops paddling for a little break. Audrey looks out     *
onto the water.                                                  *

It really is. They all take a quiet beat to admire the           *
scenery, take it all in. And then...the boat starts moving.      *
Lolo looks around, confused.                                     *

The boat is now moving fast down the river as the water around   *
them churns.                                                     *

          Shit. We’re headed to a turbine,                       *
          but there’s a safe overflow to the                     *
          right! We just need to go right,                       *
          it’s gonna be okay-- AAA!                              *
Audrey’s oar suddenly catches the water, breaking the blade      *
off completely.                                                  *

          SHIT SHIT SHIT! I caught a crab.                       *
                      KAREN                                      *
          What the fuck does that mean?!                         *
                      AUDREY                                     *
          Just keep rowing right!                                *
The boat is fast approaching the fork in the river, marked by    *
a buoy: in front of them is the dam intake/turbine situation,    *
to the right is the safe zone of river overflow. Karen starts    *
sobbing.                                                         *
                      KAREN                                      *
          I never wanted to get on the boat!                     *
                      LOLO                                       *
          Oh FUCK when you said turbines,                        *
          it’s like...fuckin’ TURBINES!                          *
The turbines are now clearly in view as the water churns even    *
faster. Lolo and Deadeye frantically paddle on the left side,    *
trying to make the boat turn right, but they’re coming up on     *
the fork, fast.                                                  *

          We are, we’re just gonna need to                       *

          WHAT?!                                                 *
Audrey grabs Karen’s oar.                                        *
                      AUDREY                                     *
          On the count of three, I need you                      *
          all to take your oars to the right,                    *
          jump, and hold on, okay?! Do you                       *

                      LOLO / DEADEYE                             *
          Yes captain! / Yes.                                    *
Audrey wraps Karen’s arms around her as the boat barrels         *
towards the open dam turbines.                                   *
                                                         63.

          We’re so close!                                        *

          THREE!                                                 *
Audrey, Lolo and Deadeye stick their oars straight across        *
right as they get to the buoy, timing it just so that the oars   *
slingshot the girls into the safe overflow zone. The boat they   *
were on continues through, straight into the turbines,           *
splitting into thousands of pieces.                              *
                      LOLO                                       *

          Oh my god, my work computer, my                        *

          I got it.                                              *
Deadeye holds up the waterproof boat bag as Audrey and Lolo      *
sigh in relief. The girls have now been safely washed past the   *
fork, downriver, but they’re still on the open water. And now    *
with no boat. The girls, treading water, struggle to keep        *
Karen afloat. Audrey points to the faraway shore.                *
                      AUDREY                                     *
          Now we just need to swim. The                          *
          shore’s not far that far, it’s                         *
          maybe only like two hundred meters.                    *
                      KAREN                                      *
          I’m gonna drown!                                       *
                      AUDREY                                     *
          You’re not gonna drown, we’ve got                      *
          you!                                                   *
As the girls try to keep Karen from dipping underwater, she      *
begins hysterically sobbing.                                     *
                      KAREN                                      *

          Don’t freak out, we’re so close!                      *
But Karen is weighing down Lolo and Deadeye who’s now on the    *
other side of her.                                              *

          sure we can’t just leave her?                         *

          But will you just stop struggling?                    *
          You’re making it worse--                              *
                     DEADEYE                                    *
          Uh oh.                                                *
HOLY FUCK. A whole herd of water buffalo (like the one we saw   *
before in town) is now swimming towards them.                   *
                      LOLO                                      *
          Oh fuck! Water buffalo!                               *
                     AUDREY                                     *
          Come on!                                              *
The girls attempt to swim, but of course, the water buffalo     *
are quickly upon them.                                          *

          I don’t even eat meat!                                *
As the buffalo swarm around them, they’re really gonna die      *
now... Except not, because a passing water buffalo bumps into   *
Karen, accidentally scooping her onto its back, saving her!     *
                      AUDREY                                    *
          Holy shit! Grab a buffalo!                            *
The girls all grab a buffalo as they ride their way to shore!   *

EXT. SHORE - CONTINUOUS                                         *
As the girls reach the shore, they tumble off their buffalo     *
rides. They collapse onto the ground, clothes torn, relieved,   *
grateful to be alive. A beat, then Audrey starts laughing.      *
Then they all start laughing at the absurdity of what just      *
happened.                                                       *

          Fair enough!                                           *
All tension from before has dissipated as the girls laugh it     *
off. Lolo looks down, notices that her pants and underwear are   *
torn.                                                            *

Lolo starts twerking on the ground as everyone hoots. Karen,     *
laughing, flips over onto her back.                              *

REVERSE ANGLE ON what they’re staring at: Karen’s HUGE PUSSY     *
TATTOO: a SCARY DEVIL that covers not only her vagina but a      *
large part of her entire pelvic region. Karen quickly hunches    *
over to cover it, but it’s too late.                             *

Karen, seeing everyone’s positive reactions and just happy to   *

- there’s no need for modesty now that everyone’s seen it.      *

Clarence runs away, shocked. Karen goes to run after him but    *
given that she’s partially nude, she doesn’t get very far.      *
He’s gone.                                                      *

From afar, we see a FISHERMAN on the shore taking a photo of    *
Karen, but the girls don’t notice. Deadeye checks her phone,    *

          Audrey was born in China but                           *
          adopted by white parents. That is                      *

She presses a brimming shot glass into Audrey’s hand and         *
everyone toasts! Audrey throws back the shot, winces at the      *
baijiu, but as the relatives pat her back and cheer, we see      *
she enjoys being part of the family. DISSOLVE TO:                *

Everyone’s still partying, the dining table now piled with the   *
remnants of a late night dinner and of course, more liquor       *
bottles. ANGLE ON Lolo and Audrey, both slightly tipsy.          *

She takes a picture of Audrey; Audrey’s wide, genuine smile     *
and the scattered empty dishes with Lolo’s family in the b.g.   *
make it a warm, endearing portrait. Audrey scrolls through      *
Lolo’s photos on her camera.                                    *

worry. The food in front of her is barely touched.              *

          I shouldn’t be honest! The truth                       *
          would only hurt him.                                   *
Lolo stops trying to argue as Karen pours a generous amount of   *
whiskey into a glass and throws the whole thing back.            *

          it’s “prestigious” or whatever. And                      *
          it means my parents don’t have to                        *
          worry about me, which is the least                       *
          I can give them after all they’ve                        *
          done for me, so...                                       *
Deadeye nods, then:                                                *
                      DEADEYE                                      *
          Excited to meet your birth mom?                          *
Audrey’s surprised that Deadeye, of all people, asked, but...      *

          You know what? Yes. I mean, I know                       *
          we have to, to get my passport                           *
          back, but it actually...it would be                      *
          amazing to meet her. If we do. I’m                       *
          not trying to get my hopes up.                           *
Grandma Chen enters, sees Audrey.                                  *

Grandma Chen hands Audrey a beautiful traditional qipao dress.   *
A few of the young cousins chatter excitedly as an adorable      *
LITTLE GIRL scampers up to Audrey.                               *

EXT. XITANG - MORNING                                            *
The girls walk through a small village, Audrey now wearing the   *
qipao.                                                           *

          I kinda love it.                                       *
The attitude is cheerful. Lolo strides purposefully, singing a   *
made-up song to a marching cadence:                              *

          That’s it. We’re here.                                 *
The girls look at where Deadeye’s looking, a small, neatly-      *
kept house. Audrey takes a deep breath.                          *

          My life would’ve been so different                     *
          if I’d grown up here. I’d be just                      *
          like everyone else... People                           *
          wouldn’t stare at me in the grocery                    *
          store. Or ask my parents where they                    *
          got me from...                                         *
A beat as Audrey collects herself. Finally...                    *
                     AUDREY (CONT'D)                             *

Lolo, touched, hugs her. Audrey hugs back, then heads            *
purposefully for the front door of the house. Lolo snaps a       *
photo: Audrey’s face filled with emotion as she goes up to the   *
door and knocks. The door opens to reveal an elderly woman,      *
HELEN. Audrey reacts, surprised. Helen has to be in her 90s;     *
way too old to be her mom.                                       *

          for... my mother?                                      *
Helen shakes her head. Audrey holds out her adoption file.       *

She plunks a teapot and cups on the table and indicates for    *
the girls to sit down, then takes Audrey’s file into another   *
room. The girls sit and look around at Helen’s controlled      *
chaos of random stuff.                                         *

          I don’t understand--                                    *
But the other girls exchange glances...they get it. Helen         *
sighs, a little impatient.                                        *

          1978, I came here from Seoul. Took                      *
          over a business helping Korean                          *
          girls who got pregnant. Their                           *
          parents send them here, they have                       *
          the babies, I get the babies to                         *
          adoption agency, Korean moms go                         *
          home. Nobody knows, so no shame on                      *
          the family. I did this many, many                       *
          times. You are number...                                *

          I’m Korean?                                             *
                     HELEN                                        *

          She looks Korean, yes?                                  *
From their faces, we see that they kind of see it.                *

          Okay, well, we still need to find                      *
          her parents. Do you have any                           *

She pushes the logbook at them, points at Audrey’s page.         *
                      HELEN (CONT'D)                             *
          No father. Mom, teenager. I called                     *
          her “Freckles” because                                 *

          She has some spots. But I don’t                        *
          know her real name.                                    *

          And there’s no contact information                     *
          of any kind...                                         *

          No. All in secrecy. When parents                       *
          request, I get these girls here,                       *
          then I send them back and never see                    *
          them again. Never hear from their                      *
          families.                                              *
               (to Audrey, fondly)                               *
          You are the only one who has ever                      *
          come back.                                             *
Helen’s warmed up now, but Audrey’s too upset to appreciate      *
it; she looks like she’s about to cry.                           *
                      AUDREY                                     *
          You don’t even have a name? I                          *
          don’t...I don’t know what...                           *
               (blurting)                                        *
          I can’t be Korean! My whole life is                    *
          a mistake?!                                            *
She abruptly stands, shoving back her chair, which hits a        *
large display case of decorative plates. Most of them fall and   *
shatter.                                                         *

          Well, thank you so much! You’ve                        *
          been really helpful, and we’re so                      *
          sorry, we’ll just get out of your                      *

Karen drops a bunch of cash on Helen’s table and drags a         *
distraught Audrey out the door. Deadeye and Lolo quickly         *
follow.                                                          *

EXT. XITANG STREET - MOMENTS LATER                               *
The girls rapidly walk away from Helen’s house, Audrey looking   *
like she’s about to fucking lose her mind.                       *

Audrey ignores her; she’s beginning to have a panic attack.      *

Audrey, in full blown panic attack now, sinks onto a nearby     *
bench. A few long, labored beats as she struggles to breathe.   *
                      AUDREY (CONT'D)                           *
          This can’t be it. This can’t be the                   *

          need this signature. I need to find                   *

The other girls see it in her face: oh shit. For the first      *
time, it’s not just a matter of the passport. It’s emotional.   *
It’s her mom. Audrey’s panic attack ramps up again...           *
Lolo turns to Deadeye and Karen, worried.                       *

          we were kids, maybe I should call                     *

          No, the phone number from my file!                    *
          We thought it was a Chinese number,                   *
          what if it’s in Korea and that’s                      *
          why it didn’t go through before?                      *
She grabs her phone back and dials.                             *

EXT. XITANG STREET - LATER                                       *
Back at Audrey’s bench, where a XITANG VILLAGE GUY now holds     *
Audrey’s phone.                                                  *
                      XITANG VILLAGE GUY                         *
               (subtitled, in Mandarin)                          *
          I only speak a little Korean.                          *
                      KAREN                                      *
          It’s fine, thank you so much.                          *
They hear a muffled voice answer the phone. Xitang Village Guy   *
begins to speak in halting Korean. Every once in a while, he     *
turns to the girls and translates it to Mandarin, which Lolo     *
then translates for Audrey:                                      *
                      XITANG VILLAGE GUY                         *
          ...caretaker of a house in Seoul.                      *
                      LOLO                                       *
          Okay, the guy on the phone used to                     *
          be the caretaker of this house.                        *
          It’s in Seoul.                                         *
                      AUDREY                                     *
          She’s from Seoul?!                                     *
Audrey can barely contain her excitement at learning this new    *
bit of information about her mother.                             *
                      LOLO                                       *
          ...he owns it now, I guess the                         *
          family moved out a long time ago                       *
          and left it to him... Yes! The                         *
          owners had a teenage daughter...                       *
          that must be them!                                     *
                                                         82.

Audrey’s face is tense with both excitement and joy; Karen and   *
Lolo are excited too. They’re SO close! As the Xitang Village    *
Guy continues listening and translating...                       *
                      AUDREY                                     *
          Did he know my mother?! Does he                        *
          know her name?                                         *
                      LOLO                                       *
          Yes! It was the Lee family. Min                        *
          Lee. Your mother’s name is Min Lee.                    *
Just hearing her mother’s name makes Audrey tear up.             *
                      AUDREY                                     *
               (hopeful)                                         *
          Oh my god. Does he still have her                      *
          contact info? Can he get in touch?                     *
Another few moments as Xitang Village Guy talks on the phone     *
and translates to Mandarin for Lolo and Karen. If we’re paying   *
attention to them, we see their faces falter for a split         *
second-- but we’re paying attention to Audrey, whose face is     *
filled with hope and anticipation. Another few beats of          *
Mandarin and then:                                               *
                       LOLO                                      *
                 (long beat)                                     *
          Yes!                                                   *
Karen reacts in surprise. Lolo speaks to the guy in Mandarin     *
for another few moments, then:                                   *
                      LOLO (CONT'D)                              *
          He’s gonna figure it out and set up                    *
          a meeting!                                             *

          Oh my god! Okay! Oh my god this is                     *
          amazing...                                             *

          Karen? Are you okay?                                   *
Karen’s face is a little shocked.                                *
                      KAREN                                      *
          Yes, I’m fine, just so surprised!                      *
                                                         83.

Audrey’s freaking the fuck out with joy as Lolo and Karen have   *
a rapid-fire convo with Xitang Village Guy off to the side.      *
They finish and thank him; he exits as Lolo turns to Audrey,     *
aglow with excitement.                                           *
[NOTE: what the audience and Audrey don’t know at this point     *
is that Lolo and Karen have heard via translation to Mandarin    *
that Audrey’s birth mom is dead; before they got a chance to     *
decide whether or not to tell Audrey, Lolo jumped the gun and    *
said the mom wanted to meet her]                                 *

          Okay, so we’ll have to sneak out of                    *
          the country.                                           *

INT. SHANGHAI AIRPORT - DAY                                      *
We see a SLOW MOTION POWER SHOT of Audrey, Lolo, Karen, and      *
Deadeye walking into the airport, looking FUCKING HOT AS HELL:   *
they are now dressed as a KPOP GIRL GROUP. Short skirts.         *
                                                           84.

High heels. Makeup and hair on fucking POINT. WIDEN TO REVEAL    *
they have a few other PEOPLE DRESSED IN SUITS scurrying around   *
them, chattering away on headsets.                               *
As they stride through the airport, we see that Lolo’s having    *
a ball, Deadeye is unfazed as ever, Audrey’s nervous, but        *
determined, and Karen, treating this like an acting job, is      *
matter-of-factly killing it. All around them, people in the      *
airport stop to gawk, take photos...who ARE these girls?         *

          you pulled this together.                              *

          having the best time and will                          *

          Of course. The BTS Army is the most                    *
          powerful fandom in the universe. We                    *
          always help those in need,                             *
          including ourselves. They even                         *
          brought their own suits.                               *
ANGLE ON one of the PEOPLE IN SUITS walking with them, who       *
drops his stern facade for a moment and does a cute, whispered   *
aside to the girls:                                              *

INT. AIRPORT SECURITY GATE - MOMENTS LATER                       *
Yeah, they might not have this. CLOSE ON the stern, skeptical    *
face of an AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICER. The girls and their         *
“entourage” all try not to look worried as he studies their      *
documents, then gestures for another officer to come over.       *
They look at the girls, look back at the documents...            *
                      AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICER                   *
          How long were you in China?                            *

          A week.                                                *
                      AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICER                   *
          You’re singers?                                        *

          I am actually the rapper.                              *
The Security Officer studies a visibly nervous Audrey.           *
                      AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICER                   *
          You don’t look like singers.                           *
Audrey’s sweating bullets, about to crack-- and then Deadeye     *
shoots Jaebock a look. He hoists the Pomeranian menacingly and   *
steps forward.                                                   *
                      JAEBOCK                                    *
          That is an insult. While they have                     *
          just debuted and therefore may not                     *
          yet have the seasoned charisma of a                    *
          veteran group like BTS or even                         *
          Blackpink, I assure you these are                      *
          professional idols who, like every                     *
          other idol, have been training                         *
          since they were 14, 15 years old.                      *
          They are dedicated and they are                        *
          talented. Show them, girls.                            *
ANGLE ON the girls: Karen, Audrey, and Lolo go wide-eyed in      *
panic: “what?!” What are they supposed to do now? But then       *
Deadeye produces a microphone, opens her mouth and SINGS.        *
                                                           87.

Holy SHIT, Deadeye’s voice is AMAZING! The other three girls     *
are shocked and struggle not to show it. All around them,        *
people stop to listen, not even just the fake fans, now there    *
are real ones that Deadeye’s literally acquiring in real time.   *
It is a MOMENT! And the security agent lets them through!        *
And with that, we’re into a STYLIZED MUSICAL SEQUENCE: the       *
song Deadeye was singing continues as the girls strut through    *
security, towards their gate, stopping for photos, stopping to   *
wave at fans, generally behaving like kpop stars. They get on    *
the plane with no problem at all, settle into seats, toast       *
with champagne glasses...                                        *

          zai...
               (then, realizing)
          I don’t know any Korean.
                      LOLO
          It’s okay, you’ll learn it.
          Everyone says it’s mad easy to pick
          up new languages as an adult.
                      AUDREY
          It’s not just the language, it’s
          everything...
She looks around; at all the people, the ads with Korean         *
products, Korean words... It’s overwhelming.                     *

Karen gestures out at the airport doors. Audrey nervously         *
walks through, and suddenly... there she is. Even though there    *
are hundreds of people waiting in the welcome area, Audrey        *
zeroes in on her. A woman, MIN, early 40s, her face open and      *
kind, clutching a sign: “AUDREY”. Holy shit. Her mom. The two     *
women lock eyes, as Min smiles, gives a litte wave. Audrey        *
approaches.                                                       *

          Can you ever forgive me?

can’t quite put her finger on it. She studies Min’s face...    *

          It’s probably nothing, but she said
          she majored in English in college.                     *
          But she only started learning after                    *

          Wasn’t that her nickname?                              *

          She probably got them lasered. Or                      *
          covered them up with makeup, Asian                     *

          but...                                                 *
She starts to sob, flings the phone away. Audrey reaches to      *
grab it off the ground, and sees the text from Clarence: “Stop   *
texting me. We’re done” followed by a screencap from a trashy-   *
looking website: it’s a picture of her PUSSY TATT that the       *
fisherman took on shore, accompanied by text in both Chinese     *
and English: “GOOD GIRL GONE BAD!”                               *

the Clarence thread so that the tatt photo isn’t on the screen   *

the phone. Looks at the screen more closely.                     *

Audrey is stunned. Lolo finally musters the courage to look
her in the eye.
                      LOLO
               (quietly)
          It’s true. The caretaker said Min                    *
          passed away... Cancer.                               *

          Oh my god.                                           *
Audrey reacts, it’s a gut punch. A tear runs down her cheek.
                      LOLO
          We’re so sorry, Audrey.
Lolo reaches for her, but Audrey shrinks back.                 *
                      AUDREY
               (as it sinks in)
          So. Instead of telling me my mother
          was gone, you thought this was the
          way to go?
                      LOLO
          You had that panic attack! And I                     *
          didn’t want you to go through this                   *
          whole journey and have this be the                   *
          end, so I just... I... I fucked up.                  *
          I’m so sorry.                                        *
Audrey shakes her head.                                        *

          This is not “fucking up”. Fucking                    *
          up is that time you ended up in the                  *
          hospital because you tried to do                     *
          the cinnamon challenge. Or when you                  *
          missed our high school graduation                    *
          because you “just forgot”. Fucking                   *
          up is what you’ve done your whole                    *
          life.                                                *

Audrey’s no longer crying.

          Fucking up is being so talented but                  *

          So instead, you go through life                       *
          being wild and reckless, saying                       *
          it’s because you’re an “artist” who                   *

                      AUDREY
          The grownup thing to do would’ve
          been to tell me the truth. Because
          I can handle it. I’m not a child
          like you.
Lolo’s in such fucking SHOCK that Audrey would actually say
all this out loud, she can’t even defend herself. Karen steps
forward.
                      KAREN
          Audrey, I’m sorry, I should’ve
          talked her out of it.
Audrey stares at her, suddenly quiet.
                      AUDREY
          I’m not surprised you didn’t. You
          lie to everyone you say you love.
          Clarence, me?
               (then)
          Lolo was right, you are a fake.
Karen reacts, stricken. Audrey gathers her things, fuming,
then turns back to Lolo.
                      AUDREY (CONT'D)
          If we didn’t grow up as the only
          two Asian girls in town, we never
          would have been friends.
               (then)
          I don’t ever want to see you again.
Death blow. There’s nothing left to say. A devastated,
completely broken Audrey walks away.                            *

INT. SEOUL HOTEL ROOM - DAY                                      *
Audrey blankly stares at her adoption form, at the empty line    *
for her birth mom’s signature. She checks a box underneath       *
marked “Deceased”, then places the form into a hotel fax         *
envelope. Audrey then looks to her laptop, where work emails     *
are piling up. She closes it, then curls up in bed and cries.    *

INT. DIFFERENT SEOUL HOTEL ROOM - DAY                            *
Karen, dressed down with no makeup, sits alone on a rumpled      *
bed. On her laptop, several different tabs are open to various   *
gossip websites: a headline reads “WHERE IS CHUNHWA? HAS         *
SECRET WHORE GONE INTO HIDING?!”. She winces as she sees a       *
video clip of Clarence, head down, surrounded by paparazzi.      *
She goes to close the tab, but gets a popup ad for a plastic     *
surgery clinic -- with tattoo removal! Hmmm. She looks back to   *
her phone, dials, gets Clarence’s voicemail...                   *

Lolo, depressed, posts a story to her Instagram: “does anyone    *
want to buy a camera? DM me for deets [string of crying          *

perks up; she’s found something interesting. Beckons Lolo        *
over.                                                            *

A cab pulls up to a graveyard. Audrey gets out, Deadeye’s note   *
in hand. The cab driver helps direct her to her birth mother’s   *
grave. Audrey puts down a small bouquet of flowers.              *

INT. DAE’S HOUSE - DAY
It’s a warm, cozy space. Dae pours tea as Audrey looks at a
few framed pictures of her birth mother. It’s the first time
Audrey has seen her face clearly.
                      DAE
          --We were only married a few years
          before she fell sick.
                      AUDREY
          I’m so sorry.
                      DAE
          Thank you...they were good years.
          We never had children of our own--
          sorry I could not show you a little
          brother or sister today.
                     AUDREY
               (smiling)
          It’s okay.
                      DAE
          But she always talked about you.
          She was a teenager when she got
          pregnant, but her boyfriend didn’t
          want to get in trouble and denied
          it. Her parents sent her to China
          until you were born. But she never
          stopped thinking about you, never
          stopped trying to find you.                           *

          Two years.                                            *

               (suddenly stricken)
          If I’d taken a vacation sooner...
Audrey struggles to hold it together and not think of all the
“what if”s, but it’s a losing battle.
                      AUDREY (CONT'D)
          If I weren’t so obsessed with work
          all the time I might have looked
          for her earlier... and maybe she
          and I could have... But it’s too
          late...
Dae looks at her; gets an idea.
                      DAE
          There’s something you should see.

files, gestures for Audrey to look:
                      DAE (CONT'D)
          When she got sick, she made goodbye                    *

          close to her parents after they                        *
          made her give you up. Anyway. She                      *
          made you one too.                                      *

introduces herself in Korean, then:

                      MIN (CONT'D)
           Sorry, my English is not good--
Dae’s voice chimes in from offscreen.
                      DAE (ON VIDEO, O.S.)
          It’s very good!
Min gestures for him to hush. It’s charming.
                      MIN (INTO CAMERA)
          I am sorry I could not be part of
          your life. I wanted to very much...
On Audrey, fighting back tears.
                      MIN (INTO CAMERA) (CONT'D)
          When you were a baby you smiled so
          big and cried so big! I wonder what
          you are like now. Are you a doctor,
          lawyer, teacher? But it doesn’t
          matter, I’m proud to be your                           *
          mother.
                      DAE (O.S., FROM VIDEO)
          It doesn’t matter? Have some
          standards for your daughter--
Min smilingly chides Dae in Korean. A tear rolls down Audrey’s
face, but she can’t help but smile; it’s not just her mother
she’s finally seeing, but a slice of her life.
                      MIN (INTO CAMERA)
          I hope this message finds you. And--
Min says a heartfelt line in Korean. Audrey leans forward,
what is she saying?

Audrey is crying, and so is Dae.                           *

Audrey rides in the passenger seat as Dae drives.
                      DAE

          ride. It’s so lucky you happened to              *
          be visiting her today.                           *

          Oh, it wasn’t luck. Your friends                 *
          messaged me. Lolo, Karen and... I                *
          must be getting this wrong, but,                 *
          Deadeye?                                         *

          They found me through the caretaker              *
          at Min’s family house. They told me              *
          you were in Korea, said I might                  *
          find you at the graveyard. Did they              *
          not tell you?                                    *
                      AUDREY
          Oh, no, we... It’s just, we got                  *
          into a little bit of a fight.                    *
          They... they lied to me. They lied               *
          and said Min was still ali--                     *

          It’s okay. I’m sure they did it                  *
          from a place of love, to protect                 *
          you from hurt.                                   *

          Min would do the same thing. She                 *
          never told me when she thought I                 *
          was getting fat, and sometimes I                 *
          have been very fat.                              *

          What is most important is you have                      *
          people in your life who love you.                       *
          What Min’s passing taught me is                         *
          that we all have limited time on                        *

Lolo and Deadeye sit in the waiting area, tickets in hand for   *
the next ferry back to China. Lolo morosely sings another made- *
up song.                                                        *

          You okay.                                               *
                      LOLO                                        *
          Yeah, I’m great. I sold my camera,                      *
          I’m gonna go to dental hygiene                          *
          school like my dad wants.                               *
          Everything’s fine.                                      *
Lolo’s obviously not fine. Deadeye pats her on the head.          *

INT. PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC - LATER                               *
Karen sits in front of a DOCTOR, who’s explaining the             *
procedure for the laser tat removal.                              *

          ...With the coloring and the size                       *
          of the tattoo, it will take at                          *
          least twenty sessions. Do you want                      *
          to proceed?                                             *

Just then her phone dings with a text. Karen looks to it,        *
confused. Then concern.                                          *
                      KAREN (CONT'D)                             *
          Actually, I’m sorry. I have to go.                     *
Karen rushes out.                                                *

INT. FERRY TERMINAL - LATER                                      *
The ferry is boarding. Lolo’s phone dings: it’s a text from      *
Audrey: the bat emoji.                                           *
                      LOLO                                       *
          Wait! Audrey just texted.                              *
               (then)                                            *
          Why is she sending the bat signal?                     *
Deadeye holds up her phone. She got it too.                      *
                      DEADEYE                                    *
          She dropped a pin to share her                         *
          location too. It’s weird, she’s in                     *
          the middle of a street. And she’s                      *
          not moving.                                            *

          Do you think she got into a car                        *
          accident?                                              *
                      DEADEYE                                    *
          What if she just, like, walked into                    *
          the middle of traffic.                                 *

one of Lolo’s photos from their trip: it’s a gorgeous           *

          artist. An amazing one.                               *
Lolo realizes that her photos are on display all around them:   *
on billboards, bus stops, etc. Landscapes, street scenes, a     *
few of the girls smiling and laughing. They’re all simple,      *
undoctored, and striking. People nearby look up and admire      *
them. Lolo’s floored.                                           *

          I know we left things kind of ugly,                   *
          but I figured hey, families fight                     *
          and make up all the time. I love                      *

Everyone reacts, especially Deadeye, who is happy to be         *
included. Audrey reaches out and pulls them all into a group    *
hug. A long beat, then Lolo ear-flicks Audrey, gesturing        *
around to all the photos.                                       *
