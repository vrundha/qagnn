                                           SYNOPSIS
•   Under the light of the waning moon we meet our protagonist Luz, who, being a successful bartender
    in a bar in L.A., confronts her last boyfriend who was married. Luz quits his job.
•   Gaspar calls Luz to ask me to go to San Diego and take care of La Cantina for a while.
•   Francisco visits Gaspar and asks him again to sell him “La Cantina”. Gaspar refuses,
•   Manu, Luz's daughter rebels with her and asks her not to take root anywhere.
•   Catalina assures Francisco that she can take care of getting Gaspar to sell “La Cantina” to complete
    the purchase of the lot where the company of Francisco plans an expensive construction.
•   We know the tenants who inhabit “La Casa de la Luna” Benign, an attractive writer with TOC.
•   Luz and Manu travel from L.A. to San Diego, to go to help Gaspar, when he unleashes a tremor.
•   Oriana, she lives a torment with her husband Carlos, an extremely jealous and possessive San Diego
    cop.
•   The tremor shakes all the tenants of “La Casa de la Luna” Beto, gets caught in the elevator with a
    student. Daniel discovers Susy, Francis' daughter with her foot bleeding and carrying her in her arms.
•   Francisco arrives at the Casa de la Luna and a frenon causes light to collide with his “Rambo” and the
    Fco SUV .
•   There's a replica of the earthquake with all the neighbors out there. Benign takes Luz in his arms, who
    was arguing with Francis, but seeing that his book has dropped on the floor, he releases Luz, dropping
    it.

AT HIM YET, HE SERVES THE TEQUILA, AND NOW HE TURNS TO HIM AND
SMILING HE PUTS IT IN FRONT OF HIM.

                     I knew it recently, but I sang it all to him, and on the
                     way out of the bar, I passed him next to him with the
                     Rambo and we left him soaked!

                     MANUELA
                     And did your boss let you take the night or what?

                     LIGHT
                     I don't have a pattern in my life. I don't work there
                     anymore, I quit.

                     MANUELA (TERRIFIED)
                     No ma... if you were doing great!

                     LIGHT
                     The chamba is not everything Manu, what is the point
                     of earning money and being good at something, if you
                     are not happy?

                     I didn't come here to talk about my wife, but about the
                     sale of the place. Gaspar, I don't take no. You have to
                     sell me this place.

                     GASPAR
                     Francisco, we've known each other for many years,
                     since my father opened “La Cantina” and you know
                     how much love I have for my changarro. Besides,
                     here we eat my wife, my son and, uh, that 's the
                     inheritance I'm going to leave to Martin. Raquel knew
                     what this meant to me, and The Moon House was to
                     her part of her life, I...

                     I said I didn't come here to talk about Raquel. This
                     area of San Diego is growing, modernizing. I need

                        GASPAR
                        Yeah, it's just tiredness. (RECOMES) Martín is young,
                        and if he gets a lot of wool at once, and he turns me
                        crazy, he spends it quickly and runs out of nothing.
                        Instead , if I leave him the restaurant, that's where
                        things change.

                        FRANCISCO
                        At least look at the offer I'm making you.

FRANCIS TAKES OUT A ROLE HE WANTS TO SHOW GASPAR, BUT
GASPAR DENIES BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE HIM.

                        GASPAR
                        No, no. I don't want to see anything.

                        Are you afraid of falling into temptation?

THE PAPER STAYS ON THE BAR. GASPAR DOESN'T EVEN SEE IT.

                        GASPAR (DECIDED)
                        I'm not going to sell. I already gave you my reasons.

                        Gaspar, I'm offering you the chance to fulfill your
                        dream of going back to Mexico, retiring with your wife
                        and live peacefully, without pressure.

                   GASPAR
                    I'll be able to do that when my son is ready to run the
                   business himself. But for now, I don't sell.

                          Hi, Francisco. The shareholders of the new project are
                          already in the meeting room.

                          FRANCISCO (WITHOUT STOPPING TO SEE THE
                          MODEL)
                          I'm going now.

SHE GETS CLOSER TO HIM AND ALSO SEES THE MODEL. SHE SEES THAT
THERE IS NO LONGER “THE HOUSE OF THE MOON” BUT THE “HOTEL”

                          CATHERINE
                          Did you make it? Gaspar agreed to sell?

FRANCIS LOOKS AT HER AND DENIES.

                          You refused the new offer?

                    It doesn't taste the same.

GASPAR COMES UP AND KEEPS COOKING. MARTIN DOESN'T DO
ANYTHING WHILE THEY TALK, BUT HE TRIES TO HELP, ALWAYS IN A
CLUMSY WAY. GASPAR DISGUISES THE DISCOMFORT.

                        I don't see why. By rejecting such an offer, it shows

                       an unusual activity on California tectonic plates. They
                       are very small earthquakes, they are not felt, but they
                       are more than double compared to last year.

                    Is it necessary for the owner of “La Cantina” to sell it to
                    you?

                    FRANCISCO
                    Yeah, yeah. And then the whole building will be mine.

                   I've known the owner of La Cantina for many years. I
                   know he 's going to sell sooner or later. I suspect he's

                        same, but not. White tequila does not spend time in
                        barrel; the reposado remains in barrel for about two to
                        ten months and the aged ripens in barrel for between

                     Yeah, he's taking advantage of a lot of people
                     hanging on money. But when they spend it, they're
                     going to stay in the same... nothing but the
                     neighborhood and its history will no longer be able to
                     recover.

                     far as I know, you too.

                     Mmmm... we 'll have to go get mom 's stuff to the
                     department she used as a studio. We haven't been
                     there since he died and his paintings, his books, his
                     painting materials must be there; what do I know, all his
                     work stuff.

                     FRANCISCO
                     The truth is , I haven 't had the courage to go. I pay a
                     person to go clean it, but I don't dare come in.

                     SUSANA
                     Why didn't you ask the cleaning person to bring you
                     Mom's things?

                     FRANCISCO
                     The truth? I'm afraid that when I empty the place,
                     Rachel's memory will disappear.

LOOK AT EACH OTHER FOR A FEW SECONDS.

                     SUSANA
                     And breaking down the building isn't going to
                     disappear?

                     FRANCISCO
                     But it will be final, no one else will be able to use the
                     place. Maybe take down the building, it'll be the only
                     way to turn the page.

                     SUSANA
                     I don't want you to miss your stuff. As she said, “art
                     lives forever.”

FRANCISCO SMILES SAD TO HEAR HER SAY THAT.

CARLOS WALKS AWAY. BETO BREATHES DEEP, CLOSE EYES AND
STARTS TO PRODUCT THE SOUND OF A VERY SHORT MANTRA “OM”.
From the opposite end we see that Claudia Castillo (30) is arriving sold out,
dressed as a nurse and is watching Beto while he passes close to the van. HE
LOOKS AT HIM FOR A MOMENT, AND HE GOES TO THE ENTRANCE OF
THE BUILDING, WHEN BETO, IN SOME KIND OF TELEPATHIC VISION.

                     I gave myself a good shot when the tremor started. I
                     fell on my knees.

                     TEO (APPROACHING)
                     I have pills for pain. I send my grandson for one.

                     JORGITA
                     Don't be barbarian, first you have to see that the
                     building is okay. No one can get in.

                     TEO
                     I just wanted to help.
TEO MOVES
AWAY.                JORGITA (TO CLAUDIA)
                     That gentleman what or what? I saw him out there,
                     watching what's going on in the building.

                     CLAUDIA
                     He's Angelica's dad. Don't you see Beto around?
                     JORGITA
                     Don't...

IN A CORNER ON THE STREET, HIDING, IS ORIANA, IN UNDERWEAR AND
COVERED ONLY BY A SHORT BAT. IN FRONT OF IT PASSES THE SUV DE
FRANCISCO, AT LOW SPEED.
INTERCUTE: INSIDE THE CAR, FRANCISCO IS SEEING INSIDE PEOPLE

                       Francisco and his bad luck black van

INTERCUTE:DANIEL LEAVES OUT OF THE BUILDING, LOADING SUSANA,
THAT COMES YOU HEAR A MURMUR OF ASTONISHMENT.

                       DOÑA ALBA (A BENIGN, SOTTO VOCE)
                       And that's his daughter.

                       BENIGN (SURPRISED)
                       Is he with Daniel?

INTERCUT AUTO FRANCISCO
POV FRANCISCO: SUSI WITH HER FOOT BLEEDING IN THE ARMS OF
DANIEL.

                       FRANCISCO
                       Susana!

FRANCISCO CARE BATCH STOP AND A CAR SHOWS HIM FROM BACK.
               SFX: CRINKING TIRE AND THEN CAR SHOCK
FAST ZOOM TO BENIGN, THEN LIGHT AND LAST TO FRANCISCO.

                            BENIGN (FROM YOUR SPACE)
                            I told you... bad luck!
Let's go to the int auto light
                            LIGHT
                            Until we collide!

INT AUTO FRANCISCO: FRANCISCO WILL GET DOWN WHEN HE HEARS
SCREAMING AND OUT THE SIDE MIRROR SEE A FURIOUS LIGHT LOW
DOWN
Intercut to the outside, light watching the fall rambo defense.

                   LIGHT (MAKING STROKES)
                   Unhappy, he unravelled me the Rambo!
FRANCISCO GETS DOWN UPSET.

                       FRANCISCO
                       Look, damn it!

SHE'S ANGRY GOING TO HIM. BENIGN HAS APPROACHED CURIOUS AND
ATTRACTED BY LIGHT
                   LIGHT

                                                              68

                       Why do you slow down, animal?

FRANCISCO LOOKS AT HER ASTONISHED FOR A SECOND, BUT REACTS
THINKING OF SUSANA.
                    FRANCISCO
                    Animal?     ( REACTS)      Now     we fix     that.
                    I need to see my daughter. With permission...

FRANCISCO SETS ASIDE THE LIGHT WITHOUT HURTING HER, BUT FIRM,
AND GOES TO SUSANA. FURIOUS LIGHT GOES AFTER HIM PULLING HIM
OUT OF THE SACK.
                    LIGHT (AS DESCRIBED)
                    Wait, don't even think you're going to leave without
                    paying me! You hurt my Rambo!

    SUDDENLY, THERE IS A SMALL REPLICA OF THE
                                EARTHQUAKE.

                         BENIGN (NEXT TO LIGHT)
                       He's shaking again!

LIGHT IS FRIGHTENED IN THE MIDDLE OF BENIGN AND FRANCIS, IN ONE
MOVEMENT STUMBLES UPON SOMETHING AND SEEMS TO FALL INTO
THE ARMS OF FRANCIS. BUT BENIGN MOVES FORWARD, RELEASES HER
BOOK THAT FALLS TO THE FLOOR AND SHE ENDS UP IN HER ARMS.

                       LIGHT (SEEING BENIGN IN THE EYES)
                       Thank you...

                       BENIGN (HYPNOTIZED. INCONSISTENT)
                       Thanks to you...

FRANCIS SEES THE UNBELIEVING SCENE. SUDDENLY BENIGN
DISCOVERS HIMSELF AS WAKING FROM THE SPELL AND FEELS TERROR
TO HAVE BIRTH IN HIS ARMS.

                       BENIGN (DEPERTING. SEE YOUR BOOK IN THE
                       FLOOR) what am I doing?

BENIGN RELEASE HER TO COLLECT HER BOOK AND LIGHT FALLS TO THE
FLOOR.

                  LIGHT (ON THE FLOOR WATCHING THEM BOTH)
                  Really? Did the men in San Diego all become idiots?
WITH FRANCISCO AND BENIGN LOOKING AT LIGHT SITTING ON THE
FLOOR
FADE OUT:
