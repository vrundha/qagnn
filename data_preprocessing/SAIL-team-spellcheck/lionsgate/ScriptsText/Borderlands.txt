1   EXT. DEEP SPACE                                                 1

    Even for a place as vast and unpopulated as deep space, this
    particular area seems like East Bumblefuck. No ships fly by,
    no fancy planets with those ooh-ahh CGI rings...

    Nope. Nothing. Nothing but the same zillion boring stars you
    always see in the opening of one of these-- hold on... wait.

    Some of the stars SHIFT, and we realize that in the center of
    the screen, in a long vertical strip, those blinky lights
    weren't stars but ACTUAL BLINKY LIGHTS...

    TITLE: GERAKI SYSTEM, OUTER REACH

    The STRUCTURE is slowly TURNING, revealing that we were
    looking sideways at something quite massive. A SPACE STATION,
    brutish and foreboding.

    TITLE: PRISON COLONY "HEPHAESTUS"

    And as it rotates further, we see now that the entire station
    is in the shape of an enormous A.

    TITLE: PROUDLY OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE ATLAS CORPORATION


2   INT. PRISON CELL - DAY? NIGHT? WHO CARES.                       2

    HAIR. Greasy, unkempt hair hanging down in front of a face we
    can barely make out. Just an eye. Man? Woman? A water drop
    hits the prisoner's face, not sure if it's water torture or
    bad plumbing.

    REVEAL: the PRISONER SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR by ANTI-GRAV CUFFS
    around the wrists. Jesus pose. Wearing a particularly
    unflattering ATLAS INMATE GARMENT.

    This is LILITH, 40. It's clear from her hair, her skin... but
    mostly the way she just hangs there without panic or anger...
    that she's been here for a LONG TIME.

    On her RIGHT FOREARM, a TATTOO. A simple shape of an ARCH,
    like an upside-down U. Or V. She stares at it. Remembering to
    remember something. Or perhaps someone. And then, before we
    hear or see anything, her EYES SHIFT quickly, full alert.

    We hear the metallic clanking of robot GUARDS approaching,
    followed by an electronic keypad, then a loud BUZZ.

                             ROBOT GUARD (O.S.)
                 50621. Come with us.
                                                                    2.



    The cuffs release, and Lilith drops, landing on the ground.
    She looks up through blurry eyes and sees two sad looking
    Atlas-branded robots. One looks like a garbage can with an
    eyeball on a wiry, metal stick.

    The robots help her stand. It's clear she has been dangling
    there for a while.


3   INT. PRISON COLONY CORRIDOR - ENDLESS                           3

    Lilith walks, hands in Atlas-branded HANDCUFFS.

    A large digital sign reads "No Rest for the Wicked."

    They pass prisoners in their cells. Lilith makes eye contact
    with ATHENA, 30s, who holds her arm in a high-tech torture
    device in the wall, gritting her teeth in pain. Athena wears
    a headband that collects sweat and drains it into tubes which
    feed into the floor. A digital display ticks days off her
    9,374 day sentence. Athena, unable to take any more, pulls
    her arm out and drops to the floor.

                             TORTURE BOX VOICE
                 Congratulations criminal, you're
                 thirty six days closer to freedom!
                 Your precious bodily fluids nourish
                 our community with Atlas 'fluid-fuel'
                 technology...

    We follow the tubes down below, where the sweat drains into
    an Atlas-branded 'Fluid Fuel' box, which pumps fluid below
    into a


4   INT. PRISON COLONY SHOWER                                       4

    Shower underneath where a gross looking prisoner washes. The
    shower water drains into a cell below.


5   INT. PRISON COLONY KITCHEN                                      5

    where a chef cooks a disgusting stew in a crockpot with skag
    by-products. An endless "ecosystem" of recycled fluids.


6   INT. WHITE ROOM - LATER                                         6

    A door SLIDES OPEN with a hiss. Lilith is nudged into the
    room by the Mantis robot with a little BZZT. Before she can
    turn around the door closes behind her. Her cuffs pop off.
                                                                 3.



She SQUINTS because it's absurdly bright in here. Yes, from
the lights over head, but also... almost everything is white.
White floors, white desk, white walls. There's a chair for
her at the table. Large windows show the star field outside.
And on the other side of the desk... A MAN. Dressed to match
the room. Perfectly dapper.

He "flips" through the pages of a HOLOGRAPHIC INMATE FILE. His
right hand is cybernetic. Designed to be appreciated. And yes,
the file says ATLAS on it. So does the wall behind his head.
And another one. "ATLAS... At last."

                           THE MAN
             Sit.
                   (when she does)
             Lilith... "The Phantom of Promethea."
             "The Menoetian Night Cat." The "Eden-
             5 She-Ghost." I rather like that one.
             Still, a bit grandiose for a thief.

He goes back to her file. In the images, holographic footage
of Lilith breaking into various places, taken from
surveillance cameras. We see images of items now. Statues,
gems, metallic bricks, computer chips...

                         THE MAN
             Fifteen bounties on your head, forty
             different law enforcement entities
             after you... seems you can find and
             steal anything-- no matter how
             protected. For a price, of course.
             But that isn't why you do it. Is it.

Something menacing in his voice there. Lilith tenses ever so
slightly. The Man notices. Almost delighted by it.

                         THE MAN
             Lilith-- I'm not here to judge you,
             we're long past that. I'm here to
             hire you.

And now he leans back, self-satisfied. And waits. Waits right
there in his seat, right under the word ATLAS. Lilith looks
at him. At the word. At him. Oh. Holy shit. He's--

                           LILITH
             Are you...?

                         THE MAN
             Deukalian Atlas. Pleased to meet you.
             So glad you guessed my name.
                                                               4.



                         LILITH
             ... You came to your own prison. To
             hire an inmate.
                   (off his smug look)
             To... what, steal something?

                         ATLAS
             Not steal. Find. And not something.

He removes a PHOTO from his jacket, and hands it to Lilith.

Lilith looks at the photo. It's of a YOUNG GIRL, maybe 12.
Sweet and innocent-looking. But a hint of sadness too. She
plays around in the picture, seemingly from a happier time.

                         ATLAS
             Someone. My daughter, Allara. Taken
             hostage by a group of anarchists. I
             paid their absurd ransom and then--
             no contact. That was one year ago.

                         LILITH
             If you know so much about me then you
             know I don't rob graves.

                            ATLAS
             She's alive.

                         LILITH
             Which ear did they send?

                            ATLAS
             She's alive.

Atlas says this with a 'Don't fuck with me' tone. Lilith
drops the badass prisoner posture. A little.

                         LILITH
             Why me? You're Deukalian Atlas, you
             have a private army.

                         ATLAS
             Six private armies. I sent my elite
             militia, the Crimson Lance, to find
             her. Even they've come up empty. Then
             it occurred to me that I was using a
             rather large hammer to solve a
             vicious rat problem, when what I
             needed was a vicious rat of my own.

Atlas pulls out an apple. Lilith looks at it like she hasn't
seen one in a long time. Maybe ever.
                                                                   5.



                             ATLAS
                 From an original seed.    You ever try
                 one? Didn't think so.

    CHOMP. He flips through her file again. We see images of
    Lilith's exploits. Demolished walls, bullet holes....

                             ATLAS
                 Never got caught-- until you broke
                 into my allegedly impossible-to-find
                 secret research facility on Phaeton.

                             LILITH
                 You'd think that would hurt my
                 employment chances. And yet...

                             ATLAS
                 You got further than anyone was ever
                 supposed to. Much, much further,
                 which, in turn, exposed security
                 flaws not even my best engineers were
                 aware of. Thus, earning you this
                 proposal: retrieve my daughter, and I
                 grant you your freedom.

                             LILITH
                 And if I say no?

    Atlas tosses the one-bite apple into a little blue buzzing
    light. The apple disintegrates with a BZZT. Get the message?

                             LILITH
                 Good thing I love kids.


7   INT. DOCKING BAY - LATER                                       7

    We're in a DOCKING CHAMBER, a suspended BRIDGE leads to the
    hull of a JUMPSHIP. Atlas waits for Lilith outside a door.

                             ATLAS
                 I'd be happy to outfit you with the
                 latest in Atlas weapons technology...

    The door opens and Lilith steps out in her classic
    Borderlands Lilith outfit. She spins and holsters her old
    looking (but hi-tech to us) VLADOFF INFINITY PISTOL..

                             LILITH
                 Thanks, but I'm more of a Vladoff
                 girl.
                                                                6.



                         ATLAS
             Had a feeling you'd say that. But
             take this.

Atlas hands her a small black Atlas-branded communicator with
one button on it.

                          ATLAS
             When you locate Allara, use this to
             signal me. Penetrates any disruption
             fields, goes directly to me. It's a
             one-of-a-kind prototype, so try not
             to break it.

                         LILITH
             Yeah, cool, but-- why not just chip
             me and--

                         ATLAS
             Chips can be removed. Your concern is
             simple. Find girl, get girl, push
             button.

They arrive at the ship. He turns to her. Quite serious.

                         ATLAS
             No one steals from a man with six
             armies. But you broke into my
             facility on Phaeton anyway. In fact,
             I don't think you even knew what was
             in there.
                   (off Lilith)
             That's why you did it... You just
             heard there was something incredible
             in there, and you had to know what it
             was. You're not a thief at heart,
             Lilith. You're an explorer. A seeker
             of the hidden, compelled to find that
             which no one else has. And that is why
             I believe you will find my daughter.
             Now, your chariot awaits...

He gestures to the ship. She steps on, then turns back.
Remembering to ask the most obvious question of all.

                         LILITH
             Where exactly am I going?

                           ATLAS
                     (a little smile)
             Home.

PANIC in Lilith's eyes. She makes a motion to the door...
                                                                     7.



                                 LILITH
                     WAIT WAIT NO NO N--

     WOOSH--WHAMMM. The doors SLIDE SHUT, trapping her inside. The
     ship is RELEASED from its moorings, and we're--


8    INT. JUMPSHIP - CONTINUOUS                                      8

     A small vessel with an autopilot, designed to carry just a
     few people. In this case, one very, very, very angry--

                                 LILITH
                     YOU MOTHERFUUU--

     The ship accelerates, and she falls backwards. Really should
     have gotten into a seat before--


9    EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                         9

     --the ship ACCELERATES into space, hurtling away from us
     until the glow of its engines disappears among the stars.


10   EXT. THE ARID BADLANDS - PANDORA - HOURS LATER                 10

     The sun-- wait, that's a diamond-ish covered moon?--
     whatever... the BRIGHT THING IN THE SKY is shining down on
     the BAKED, PARCHED GROUND. Not a sound, other than the
     whistle of a HOT WIND, and the rusty whine of--

     THE DERELICT SPACEPORT - maybe it was nice back in its day,
     but on this day, it's a piece of shit. And then... THE ATLAS
     JUMPSHIP roars into view, circles around, hovering over what
     was once a landing pad, but is now metal poles with scraps of
     wood.


11   INT. JUMPSHIP                                                  11

     The DOOR OPENS, revealing a VERY PISSED OFF Lilith. She
     shields her eyes from the glare.

                                 PLEASANT AUTOPILOT VOICE
                     Please exit the ship.

                                 LILITH
                     Nope. Not happening.

                                 PLEASANT AUTOPILOT VOICE
                     You need to exit the ship.
                                                                       8.



                                LILITH
                  Suck my di-

     With that, the ship begins TILTING--

                              LILITH
                  Okay! Okay! I'm going!

                              PLEASANT AUTOPILOT VOICE
                  Have a pleasant trip.

     An AIR BLAST SHOOTS from the ship, sending Lilith to the
     ground.



12   EXT. THE ARID BADLANDS - PANDORA - DAY                           12

     She lands on the rocky dirt with a THUD, a beat later an
     Atlas PACK drops next to her, nearly hitting her head.

     She breathes a sigh of   annoyance, and then an ATLAS
     INFLATABLE SAFETY RAFT   LANDS ON HER. Lilith looks up and
     fires off a torrent of   NSFW words, none of which we can hear
     as the jump ship takes   off.

     Lilith looks out toward the horizon. In the far distance, a
     MURKY HAZE... some massive area blanketed in an evil vapor.

     Then... a CREAKING NOISE. Lilith turns and sees...

     A LARGE BILLBOARD, meant to welcome visitors in some long
     ago, far happier time. A painting of a MOTHER holding her
     LITTLE DAUGHTER as they both look off into the distance,
     smiling, as if welcoming some bright, beautiful tomorrow.

     It reads: Welcome to Pandora! The NEXT paradise planet! Well,
     it mostly says that. A bunch of the rusting panels have
     fallen off. It's decaying and riddled with BULLET HOLES.

     Lilith stares at the little girl's face. So happy, so hopeful.
     With her shot-out eyes and sniper-rifled teeth. Across her
     face, someone has SPRAY-PAINTED: WHAT'S IN THE VAULT?

     Lilith stares at the mother and girl, remember something...


13   EXT. THE ARID BADLANDS FB - DAY                                  13

     FLASH: The same spot, years earlier. A ship taking off - a
     little girl crying - screaming for her mother -
                                                                     9.



14   EXT. THE ARID BADLANDS - DAY                                   14

     BACK TO THE PRESENT:

     A GROWL. Unseen by Lilith, a LONE SKAG creeps up behind her.
     An ugly hyena-sized creature, it opens back its face, all
     teeth, preparing to charge its unsuspecting prey...

     Lilith stares at the sign, lost in a memory, the girl
     screaming for her mother...the sound of the ship leaving -

     Suddenly - CRASH! The sign is OBLITERATED by a RAIDER TRUCK
     SMASHING THROUGH, coming right at Lilith, snapping her out of
     her memory... Lilith DUCKS out of the way... The truck hits
     the ground and slams into the Skag.

     Lilith leaps through the hole in the sign, taking cover.

     The truck roars and spins back, PSYCHO RAIDERS all over it...
     They whoop and holler with animalistic cries. The raiders
     floor it - charging right back towards Lilith.

     Lilith readies her Vladof, when the COMMUNICATOR CHIRPS.

                              ATLAS (COMMUNICATOR)
                  I see you've arrived. Pandora's
                  exosphere is highly ionostatic-

                              LILITH
                  Yeah, hey, I'm a little busy with the
                  welcoming committee -

     Atlas continues talking as if nothing she said matters. The
     Raider truck speeds closer... Lilith scans the landscape, and
     sees an old corroded chemical barrel labeled FLAMMABLE.

     The Psychos shoot at Lilith, tearing up the picture of the
     little girl in the sign. Lilith spins around and FIRES,
     hitting the barrel as the Psychos drive past it!

     BOOM! The barrel blows, flipping the Raider Truck ON ITS
     SIDE, SKIDDING FULL SPEED ACROSS THE DIRT. The Psychos
     scream, only now it's not out of fun... The driver steers
     helplessly as they skid towards a giant hole in the ground...

     The Truck tumbles into the deep hole...a SKAG DEN. It's like
     falling into an alligator pit, only less friendly.

     Lilith walks up to the hole, as we hear the chomping and
     growling of skags eating what's left of the Psychos.

                              ATLAS (COMMUNICATOR)
                  Did you get all that?
                                                                     10.



                              LILITH
                  Of course. But... just to be sure, do
                  you mind repeating?

                              ATLAS (COMMUNICATOR)
                  I said do not use the communicator
                  until you find and secure Allara.

     The Skag that truck hit is still alive, dragging itself
     towards Lilith with its front paws. Lilith sees one last
     Psycho crawling up the wall of the pit. She raises her gun.

                              LILITH
                  And if I can't find her?

     Suddenly, the Skag leaps - past Lilith - onto the psycho with
     a chomp to the face! They both fall to the bottom of the pit.

                              ATLAS (COMMUNICATOR)
                  Then welcome home. For good.

     BZZZT. End of communication. Lilith throws her pack over her
     shoulder and takes a step into the horizon when - BOOM BOOM
     BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM... The title "BORDERLANDS" drops out
     out of the sky, settling in the dust like the Hollywood sign.

     Lilith shakes her head, walking on.

                              LILITH
                  God I hate this place.


15   EXT. WASTELANDS OF PANDORDA - DAY                              15

     We hear THE SOUND OF AN APPROACHING VEHICLE. Oh god, more?
     Nope... this is just a kitbashed old TRANSPORT BUS. It pulls
     to a stop, and the DOOR opens with a HISS. The driver is
     MARCUS. Stocky, 50, circle beard on his face, and a twinkle
     in his eye. He speaks with an odd accent.

                                 MARCUS
                  Need a ride?

     Lilith looks around. Spot fires, monster guts, and debris
     scattered around her. Yeah. She needs a ride.

                              MARCUS
                  Great! Welcome aboard - people
                  inside, bags up top. Rules are rules.
                  Hey, nice Vladof, love the Infinity!
                                                                     11.



16   INT. MARCUS BUS - MOMENTS LATER                              16

     Marcus drives along, cheery. Checks his mirror to see LILITH,
     his only passenger. Grabs a microphone. Feedback! SQUEEWEEW!

                              MARCUS
                  Hello passenger! My name is Marcus--

                              LILITH
                  I can hear you without--

                              MARCUS
                  Welcome to Pandora! Look around, at our
                  endless lush rain forests and magical
                  glowing fauna. Kidding! We're not that
                  Pandora, we're the original Pandora,
                  not that anyone believes we took the
                  name first. Next stop: Fyrestone,
                  where all Vault Hunters begin.

                              LILITH
                  I'm not a Vault Hunter.

                              MARCUS
                  If you say so! But this bus is for
                  transporting Vault Hunters, sooooo...

     Marcus pushes a button. A small video screen protected by a
     cage on the back of the seat in front of her starts up. ON
     VIDEO SCREEN - a corny fanfare, and a strangely retro WELCOME
     video begins to play over ANIMATED IMAGES.

     "A Magic Marcus production..."

                              NARRATOR
                  Well hel-LO, brave Vault Hunter!

                              LILITH
                  I said, I'm not a--

                              NARRATOR
                  So you've come in search of THE LOST
                  VAULT OF THE ERIDEANS!!!

                              LILITH
                  Oh my god-- THERE IS NO VAULT. TURN
                  THIS OFF PLEASE.

                              MARCUS
                  No can do. Price of Admission!

     Marcus mouths along with the words, excitedly watching her
     reaction in the rear view mirror.
                                                                 12.



                              NARRATOR
                  Right here on the placid, pristine,
                  perfectly-preened paradise planet
                  PAAAAANDDOOOORRRRAAAA!!!


17   EXT. WASTELANDS - PANDORA - DAY                             17

     OUTSIDE - a skag takes a shit in the middle of the road
     before getting its shit pushed in by the bus’ all-terrain
     tires. Paradise, indeed.


18   INT. MARCUS BUS - DAY                                       18

     BACK ON THE SCREEN - footage of ERIDEAN RELIEFS depicting
     angelic humanoid beings.

                              NARRATOR
                  The Erideans left little behind, but
                  the technology within each rare
                  Eridean relic that has been found?
                  Why, it's the science behind many of
                  the advanced products sold by all
                  your favorite vertically-integrated
                  multisystem conglomerates! Like Dahl,
                  Atlas, aaaaaand Hyperion!

                              MARCUS
                  Hyperion is the WORST, right?

                              LILITH
                  Turn this shit off. NOW.

                              NARRATOR
                  Legend tells that the Erideans hid
                  their greatest power in a SECRET VAULT
                  somewhere right here on Pandora!

     Lilith pulls out her Vladof. Aims for the screen.

                              MARCUS
                  Don't shoot - that Infinity will go
                  right through the monitor and into
                  me, which would be bad for both our
                  health at these speeds, ha ha!
                                                                     13.



                              NARRATOR
                  And when our corporate overlords
                  heard about all that juicy treasure,
                  they cranked capitalism up to 11,
                  muscled in, set up shop, and
                  displaced all those peaceful folks
                  who already called Pandora home!


19   EXT. PANDORA FB - DAY                                          19

     Footage of a HYPERION SHIP landing dead on top of an idyllic
     FARMING HOMESTEAD. Killing all inside.


20   INT. MARCUS BUS - DAY                                          20

     Lilith KICKS at the SECURITY CAGE. It doesn't budge.

                              NARRATOR
                  But they didn’t just come alone, they
                  brought friends!

     Lilith KICKS AND KICKS at the monitor. Marcus looks in the
     mirror, getting a little concerned.

                              MARCUS
                  Hey, um, those are expensive - your
                  leg fall asleep or something?

                              NARRATOR
                  ...Hordes of prisoners to use as
                  slave labor in the excavation pits!
                  But radiation affected their brains
                  and turned them into psychopaths who
                  roam the land maiming and killing to
                  this day. But still - no vault!

                              LILITH
                  Because THERE IS NO DAMN VAULT.

     Her angry boot finally breaks through the cage, cracking the
     monitor. BZZT. The buzz sends the whole system on the fritz.
     The video glitches and garbles on all the monitors.

     Marcus, panicked, hits a control panel. A string of old video
     tape spills out of a slot like spaghetti. Marcus stops the
     bus, aghast.
                                                                     14.



21   EXT. WASTELANDS - PANDORA - DAY                                21

     Lilith stands outside the bus, tail between her legs. Marcus
     screams at her from the driver's seat.

                              MARCUS
                  Forty bloody miles to Fyrestone,
                  enjoy starving to death if the
                  Threshers don't eat you first! Oh,
                  and I'll take that fancy pack of
                  yours as payment for breaking my boss
                  entertainment system!

     Marcus drives off. She knows he's not wrong, she doesn't even
     put up a fight. The bus hits a POTHOLE in the road, bumping,
     sending her pack off the roof and to the ground.

     Lilith picks it up, dusts it off, and throws it over her
     shoulder and starts walking into the desolate landscape.

     But she's not alone... A POV from far, far away watches her
     through binoculars as she navigates the hostile terrain.


22   EXT. PANDORA - WASTELANDS - DAY                                22

     Lilith walks past broken down, shot-up faded signs from DAHL
     and HYPERION. Vandalized on them by different hands: "VAULT
     OR DIE" "IT AIN'T HERE" and "NOT MY VAULT!"

     A few wanted posters for scary looking criminals hang on
     posts, blowing in the wind. One poster stands out: a serious
     looking soldier in a Crimson Lance uniform. ROLAND. Wanted:
     $100,000 alive. $10,000 Head only. $17,500 Head with
     shoulders attached.

     Sitting on the post above the poster she sees a doll: a
     headless bunny. Odd... She pulls the doll off the sign,
     examines the string on its back, then slips it in her bag.


23   EXT. SHANTY - OUTSKIRTS - DAY                                  23

     Lilith talks with a few poor civilians, who live in the
     remains of old Dahl and Hyperion ships. She shows the photo,
     they shake their heads and go back inside, unable to help.


24   EXT. STATUE - DUSK                                             24

     A scrap metal and garbage pile in the middle of nowhere, and
     the foot of a giant, towering statue of some evil warlord.
                                                                       15.



     Lilith approaches the statue with trepidation: a Psycho
     warrior in a spiked steel battle suit, with a horned mask, a
     giant machete in hand. A terrifying vision, meant to warn
     anyone who enters these lands. Below it written ALL HAIL
     KROM. Suddenly, the statue bellows in a loud, crackled, pre-
     recorded voice:

                              STATUE
                  ALL HAIL KROM!

     Lilith remembers something terrible. A voice comes into her
     head. The same voice, blending with the recorded one.

                              KROM (V.O.)
                  ALL HAIL KROM.


25   EXT. PANDORA FB - DAY                                          25

     FLASH: Continuation of what we saw earlier. A LITTLE GIRL -
     REACHING FOR HER MOTHER - SCREAMING. DUST, WIND, CHAOS. A
     SHIP TAKING OFF... And then KROM- POINTING A CANNON FROM A
     TURRET AT HER MOTHER.


26   EXT. STATUE - DUSK                                             26

     BACK TO THE PRESENT:

     Lilith realizes she's activating a speaker by standing on a
     small piece of metal. She takes her foot off. It stops.

     She hears some rustling noise and turns to the scrap pile.
     Someone, or something, is under there. She pulls her gun,
     ready, when a child, about 10, pops up with up a rusty
     weapon. A few other kids scramble out, admiring the find.

                              CHILD
                  Betcha it still works!

     The child is about to fire the gun, when Lilith grabs the
     kid's hand. The kid looks surprised.

                              LILITH
                  Don't wanna fire an old Tediore if
                  you like having fingers.

     Lilith tosses the old gun up and SHOOTS it like a skeet.    The
     gun EXPLODES, much to the kids delight.

                              LILITH
                  Chiquita Amigos are about the
                  cheapest guns ever made.
                              (MORE)
                                                                      16.


                              LILITH (cont'd)
                  If you ever see someone missing a
                  hand, chances are they owned one.
                  Hey, can you guys tell me-

     She turns, and sees the kids are GONE. Hiding in the scrap.

                              LILITH
                  ...tell me how I'm gonna finish all
                  this chocolate by myself?

     Lilith takes out a large Atlas CHOCOLATE BAR from her pack.
     Just hearing the unwrapping noise and the kids jump out.

                                KIDS
                  I'll help -    give it, give it -

                              LILITH
                  There's plenty for everyone - if I
                  share. But, you have to share
                  something with me. A little info. I
                  want to know if you've seen her.

     Lilith shows them the photo of Allara.   The kids look at each
     other, a knowing look between them.

                              CHILD
                  You with the red hats? Your bag says
                  Atlas, like their trucks.

                              LILITH
                  I need to find her before they do. So
                  I can help her. She's in danger.


27   EXT. ROCKS - DUSK                                              27

     The kids lead Lilith up a rocky path, over a boulder field.
     They all climb with fairly natural instincts for the rocks.

     They reach an opening in the rocks, small enough for a child
     to fit through.

                              CHILD
                  She hides in there where it's safe
                  from Krom and his psychos. If they
                  catch you, they own you...unless you
                  die or lose an arm or something.
                  They're too big to fit in there.

                              LILITH
                  Good thing you helped me with that
                  chocolate.
                                                                     17.



     Lilith squeezes her pack in, and then slips into the hole
     feet first. We see she has total control over her body. She
     twists, turns, and fits in. Now we get a sense of how she got
     in and out of places as a thief.


28   INT. CAVE - DUSK                                              28

     Lilith stands in the cramped corridor in the rock. A small
     light at the end of the corridor. She takes a step, but her
     bag wedges in the rock. She leaves it in the wedge.

                              LILITH
                  Hello?

     Lilith's voice echoes through the cave.

     At the very end, she sees a large (large for a child) room,
     with a small girl standing by a fire. The fire illuminates a
     huge drawing the girl's scratched in the rock with a tool.

     In the illustration, a winged half-bird/half-human hovers
     over the ground, in a protective bubble, shooting fire from
     its hands at psychos below. The girl senses Lilith's
     presence, but keeps drawing, never turning around.

                              LILITH
                  That's a pretty drawing. What is it?

                              DRAWING GIRL
                  Firehawk. She can phase walk. Every
                  kid on Pandora knows it.

                              LILITH
                  I was a kid on Pandora, I don't know
                  it.

                              DRAWING GIRL
                  You probably just forgot it.
                  Firehawk's gonna save us. She's in
                  hiding, but when they find the vault
                  keys, she's gonna come out and burn
                  all the bad people.

                              LILITH
                  Let's hope so. Can I ask you
                  something?

                              DRAWING GIRL
                  You just did.

                              LILITH
                  I haven't asked it yet.
                                                                18.



                              DRAWING GIRL
                  You asked if you could ask me
                  something. That's a question.

                              LILITH
                  Fair enough. Is this you?

     Lilith holds up the picture. The girl stops drawing.

                                 DRAWING GIRL
                  You tell me.

                              LILITH
                  I can't if you don't turn around.

                              DRAWING GIRL
                  Then ask me to turn around.

                              LILITH
                  Would you mind turn -

                              DRAWING GIRL
                  I haven't seen her.

                              LILITH
                  How can you be sure?

     The girl turns around. She's BLIND. Her EYES HAVE BEEN
     SCRATCHED. Covered with bandages, crudely taped.

                              DRAWING GIRL
                  Because I haven't seen anything. You
                  want to hear another story? About the
                  little girl Krom kidnapped and put in
                  a cage for the Raks to scratch her
                  eyes out? And the red hat soldiers
                  who watched and did nothing?

     Lilith stumbles back. It's definitely not Allara.

                              LILITH
                  ...I'm sorry.

                              DRAWING GIRL
                  You're not sorry. But you will be.


29   EXT. ROCK FACE - NIGHT                                     29

     Lilith exits cave to find the kids, and her pack - gone.

                              LILITH
                  Hey. HEEEEYYY!!!!! Dammit.
                                                                     19.



                              DRAWING GIRL
                        (from the cave)
                  Now you're sorry.

                              LILITH
                  Now I'm PISSED.


30   EXT. CAMPFIRE - WASTELANDS - NIGHT                             30

     Lilith sits by a campfire near some rocks. A small rodent-
     like CREATURE scurries by. Lilith PINS it with a knife.


31   EXT. CAMPFIRE - LATER                                          31

     Lilith roasts the rodent creature on the stick. It looks
     about as tasty as rodent on a stick sounds.

     Off in the distance, we hear Krom's Psychos attack. We don't
     know who they're attacking, we just hear the victim's screams
     and the roar of their vehicles. "ALL HAIL KROM" echoes.

     A large SHADOW GROWS behind Lilith. A CREATURE APPROACHING
     BEHIND HER... Lilith instinctively turns and FIRES -

     We hear a METALLIC-VOICED SCREAM, and then a loud CLATTER as
     something hits the ground.

                              VOICE (SHADOWS)
                  My eye! You shot me in my eye!

     It RISES UP from the rock pile it landed in, and now we see
     it. Looks like a trashcan balancing on one wheel with two
     spindly arms waving about and--

                              SHITTY ROBOT
                  You've blinded me for life! How will
                  I manage to surviii'm just kidding!

     The robot has TURNED around to face forward, revealing its
     shot-at but perfectly fine ROUND, LIT-UP EYE.

                              SHITTY ROBOT
                  I was designed to withstand all kinds
                  of violent acts, even completely
                  unjustified ones like yours!

                              LILITH
                  You're the voice on that godawful
                  video.
                                                             20.



                         SHITTY ROBOT
             I very well could be! Hyperion used
             one voice module across an entire
             line of now-discontinued products,
             because it's SO PLEASING TO THE EAR!

Lilith cringes. It really is grating.

                         LILITH
             How do I shut you up?

                         SHITTY ROBOT
             I'm programmed for humor, so I will
             process that as witty banter! Now I
             bet you're wondering, "what's the
             deal with this thing?"!!!

                         LILITH
             I'm not. Beat it.

                         SHITTY ROBOT
             I'm a Hyperion brand CL4P-TP,
             possibly the last of my kind still in
             service! But you can call me--

She SHOOTS the robot in the eye AGAIN. He goes flying, and
lands in a heap.

                         SHITTY ROBOT
             Whoopsy! You accidentally shot me in
             the face again! As I was saying, you
             can call me CLAPTRAP!

                         LILITH
             I can do this all night. So piss off.

                         SHITTY ROBOT
             Sorry! No can do! Believe me, I wish
             I could based on what little I've
             experienced of your horrendous
             personality! Buuuut I have no choice.

                         LILITH
             What do you mean? Did Atlas send you?

                         CLAPTRAP
             Atlas? YUCK! I don't work for the
             competition! No, I've been lying dormant
             under a garbage heap for-- calculating--
             26 years! But the moment you landed on
             Pandora, I was re-activated -- because
             I've been programmed to help you.

                         CLAPTRAP (cont'd)
             So thank you for waking me from my
             blissful slumber into this living hell!

                         LILITH
             No one knew I was coming here, not
             even me. Who programmed you?

Gun at his eye.

                         CLAPTRAP
             I don't know! Which is a shame,
             because you're an awful person and
             I'd love to know who to blame for
             this. Since I don't, I have no choice
             but to serve you UNTIL YOU'RE DEAD...
             Did that sound like a threat? Sorry!
             Anyway, it's true. As long as you're
             NOT DEAD!-- I'm here to help! And I
             have many skills!
                   (demonstrates)
             Balancing! Turning in circles.
             Holding objects with only a 38%
             chance of crushing them!

                         LILITH
             I don't need a partner.

                         CLAPTRAP
             Oh, and I can find pretty much anyone
             currently alive on Pandora!

This gets Lilith's attention. She lowers the gun.

                         LILITH
             Anyone?

                         CLAPTRAP
             A-ha, so you're looking for someone!
             Just show me a picture, I'll hack into
             the abandoned ECHONET communications
             system, search its slowly-dying visual
             banks for matches, and find your
             target's last known location!

                         LILITH
             Can't other robots do this?

                         CLAPTRAP
             Not likely! In robot years I'm a
             dinosaur, probably the last of an
             obsolete model capable of
             communicating with Echonet, built by
             the same manufacturer.

                              CLAPTRAP (cont'd)
                  Your arrival reactivated me, so no
                  one has achieved this because they
                  were attempting with modern
                  technology. Do I need to keep
                  explaining? Is everyone at home
                  following?

                              LILITH
                  Okay okay, I get it! Find her.

     Lilith holds the photo of Allara in front of Claptrap. A
     SCANNING BEAM emits from his eye, moving over it.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  Aaaaaaaccessing network!

     He rocks back and forth rhythmically as he sings a song.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  Scanning, scanning, scanning,
                  scanning, scanning--

                              LILITH
                  Without the singing.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  No can do, blame the programming
                  Gods. Scanning, scanning, scanning--
                  done! Your target was last recorded
                  near an abandoned railroad crossing,
                  up north in the Tundra Express! Too
                  bad for you it's suuuuuuper
                  dangerous. Gee, I hope you DON'T DIE.

                              LILITH
                  What's the fastest way there?


32   EXT. OPEN TERRITORY CLIFFS - DAY                            32

     From high atop a cliff, Lilith and Claptrap peek over the
     rocks, looking down on a Canyon. Psychos race around in
     Outrunners near the entrance. The place is crawling with
     them. Then her skin goes cold as she reads KROM'S CANYON,
     written in bones. She pops down, hiding out of sight.

                              LILITH
                  Find another way.
                                                                     23.



                                 CLAPTRAP
                     Absolutely. Around the canyon, it's
                     only 132 two days on foot, with a 98%
                     percent chance of being attacked by a
                     Crawmaggot!

     Lilith thinks about it, strategizing how to do this.

                                 LILITH
                     Gimme a hand.

                                 CLAPTRAP
                     I prefer the term "claw-like gripper
                     thingy," but yes, happy to assist.

     Claptrap puts out his gripper, taking her foot. He's strong.

                                 LILITH
                     Don't crush it, that foot's real.

                                 CLAPTRAP
                     The crush function on this model's
                     armpit-activated. You're perfectly
                     safe. I'm sure at no point will you
                     need to use it.

     Claptrap's arm raises her up to a more perilous perch with a
     better view. She takes out a small pair of binoculars.

     Then the screen BLINKS - and we're magnified. BLINKS AGAIN -
     more magnified - someone's watching Lilith...


33   EXT. KROM'S CANYON - DAY                                       33

     LILITH'S POV:

     Down below, she sees... a psycho, holding her Atlas pack.
     Others waving around the various items in her pack.

     High above, hanging in a cage - Lilith sees THE CHILDREN WHO
     ROBBED HER. They look terrified. In the sky - RAKS. Giant
     winged beasts. One at a time, they DIVEBOMB THE CAGE,
     knocking into the bars, sending it swinging like a pendulum.

     The kids scream. Down below - other children - working,
     building, breaking rocks - Krom's slaves.

     Lilith then notices a terrifying looking man wearing a metal
     suit with horns, standing on a boulder. Lilith's eyes narrow.
     She hears the voice in her head.
                                                                     24.



                              KROM (V.O.)
                  ALL HAIL KROM.

     She aims the rifle at Krom's head, then follows him in her
     sights as he walks over to... two soldiers wearing Red Hats,
     near an ATLAS MILITARY VEHICLE. The Crimson Lance... The
     soldiers glance at the kids in the cage, looking at them with
     binoculars. They shake their heads no to Krom, then get back
     in their Atlas vehicle...doing absolutely nothing to help.


34   EXT. OPEN TERRITORY - CLIFF - DAY                               34

     Lilith's finger twitches, itching to shoot. Teeth gritting.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  I'm sure they'll let us through if
                  you ask politely. That would never
                  get you killed!

     Lilith takes her eye off the sight and looks around. Just
     outside the entrance, by the Outrunners, she spots a Psycho,
     farther out, refueling at an old pump.

                              LILITH
                  Got a better plan.


35   EXT. KROM'S CANYON - DAY                                        35

     The Rak hits the cage, its claws wildly swinging inside at
     the kids. The kids SCREAM. The cage swings.

     Suddenly.... BOOM!   The Rak DROPS DEAD, SHOT OUT OF THE SKY.

     BOOM! Another shot! The cage's chain EXPLODES as it swings -
     The cage breaks open on the rocks, and the kids ESCAPE! They
     scramble into the cracks of the rocks like roaches.

     Krom looks around, no idea what just happened. The slave
     children duck in terror. The Psychos scream and charge
     towards the gunfire, bloodthirsty.

     Suddenly, BANG! BANG! BANG!   MORE GUNFIRE, this time from a
     totally different direction, confusing everyone.


36   EXT. OPEN TERRITORY - CLIFF - DAY                               36

     Lilith looks up, mid-run, and sees a GLINT from a rifle, NOW
     AIMED AT HER, from across the canyon. But it doesn't fire.

     Lilith keeps running. The POV watches her, then leaves.
                                                                    25.



37   EXT. REFUELING PUMP - DAY                                      37

     The Psycho refueling his car steps away from the pump to see
     what the commotion is. He quickly runs back to put the hose
     away, when Lilith LEAPS on him from the hood of the
     Outrunner, strangling him from behind with the hose!

     Claptrap wheels over to help but just gets KICKED away.
     Lilith WRAPS THE GAS HOSE around the man's neck and jams the
     pump into his PSYCHO MASK EYE HOLE.

                              LILITH
                  Claptrap! ...Fill 'er up!

     Claptrap hits the lever at the pump, sending fuel into the
     psycho's mask. Within seconds, he's on the ground, dead.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  That was so out of character to save
                  those children!

                              LILITH
                  It was a distraction. Get on.

     Claptrap notices there's only one seat, but a cage on the
     back of the vehicle, used for transporting anyone unlucky.
     The headless bunny is in the back. This must have been the
     guy who picked up the kids.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  Oh look, someone left their bunny!
                  So where do I sit?


38   EXT. WASTELANDS - PANDORA - DAY                                38

     VRRRROOOOOOMMMMM.   Claptrap banging around in the cage.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  THIS WAS NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND!

     Lilith barrels across the landscape, wearing the dead
     Psycho's face mask. A truck full of Psychos PULLS OUT IN
     FRONT OF HER. Psychos on the back ready to leap on her.

     She looks to the side - another with psychos pulling up.

     Lilith looks at the psycho about to leap and HOLDS UP THE
     DEAD PSYCHO'S MACHETE LIKE MIDDLE FINGER AT HIM. The psychos
     laugh...and peel off. They join the other vehicle, which
     breaks away, leaving her. The decoy worked.
                                                                     26.



39   EXT. TUNDRA EXPRESS - LATER                                    39

     The Outrunner rolls slowly through a narrow CHANNEL and
     emerges into AN ABANDONED QUARRY. Cliff walls extend up all
     around, pockmarked by abandoned mining equipment. She stops.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  Please, kill my power. I won't tell.

                              LILITH
                  You said you wanted to help.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  I said I'm programmed to help. What I
                  want to do is wipe my memory, you
                  horrendous she-devil. Please.

     Against the far wall of the quarry, a gargantuan pile of DEAD
     VEHICLES - trucks, buses, bulldozers, you name it.

                              LILITH
                  You sure this was it?

                              CLAPTRAP
                  I never make mistakes! We are in the
                  last known location of your quarry.
                  HAHAHAHA - get it?

     Lilith looks around. No signs of life.

                              LILITH
                  Ask Echonet if she's still here.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  Accessing... the girl was here... but
                  it looks like she's long gone by now.

                              LILITH
                        (sees something)
                  Does it.

     CLOSE ON: a smoothed area of ground. Like 90˚ of a circle.
     Lilith crouches down, examining the ground. Runs her finger
     over it. Something scraped here. Something like--

     A RUSTY DOOR - part of an old TANKER TRUCK on the bottom of
     the vehicle stack. Lilith PULLS the door OPEN. It SCRAPES the
     ground. Claptrap peers into the truck's cab from the cage.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  I can search for clues if-- ...or I
                  can watch from here.
                              (MORE)
                                                                     27.


                              CLAPTRAP (cont'd)
                  I have very little depth perception
                  anyway. I can just magnify. Safer for
                  us both.

     Lilith sprinkles a little dust from the ground, illuminating
     a MICRO-WIRE stretched taut across the entrance. Lilith
     smiles, in her element. Runs her hands over the seat,
     feeling... then looks down... then up at the roof of the
     cab... Yup. Got it.

     She PULLS a lever we didn't see under the seat, and FLINGS
     the seat BACK, revealing a SPRING-LOADED METAL LADDER, which
     SHOOTS STRAIGHT UP, PUNCHING right through a HINGED DOOR in
     the ceiling of the cab. It leads right up into the fortress
     of piled vehicles.

     She carefully clambers over the wire and HEADS UP.


40   INT. ABANDONED LAIR - MOMENTS LATER                            40

     A TRAPDOOR at the bottom of a stacked RV of some sort is
     PUSHED UP... and Lilith pokes her head up. Head on a swivel.
     She pulls her gun. Hits the light on it. Her eyes go wide.
     Holy shit. She climbs all the way in... and now we see it.

     THE LAIR - someone was living here. Filthy mattress, shabby
     clothes, empty skag meat tins, old bits of stuffed animals,
     including a bunny head that matches the doll. And then-- A
     WALL OF MADNESS.

     One wall of the lair is covered in hand drawn MAPS, NOTES,
     lines drawn between them all, and the writing... TREASURE
     BEYOND TREASURE - FIND THE KEY - THREE PARTS - DAUGHTER OF
     ERIDEA - OPEN THE VAULT - SALVATION!!!!!

     And spray-painted over the whole shebang: THE SAME SHAPE
     that's on Lilith's arm. Lilith moves in closer... to a page
     with some kind of ancient writing... she doesn't know what it
     says, but she's seen these glyphs before...

                              ECHOING VOICE
                  Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmmmmm hmmmm....

     Lilith WHIRLS. Gun up. An unseen GIRL'S VOICE is ECHOING from
     somewhere within the massive mountain of vehicles. And it's
     humming the tune to... Pop Goes The Weasel?

     The voice seems to be moving. Above. To the right. To the
     left. This is a trap. Lilith is already on the move.
                                                                     28.



41   EXT. TUNDRA EXPRESS QUARRY - SECONDS LATER                     41

     Lilith HURTLES out of the truck, guns ready.

                              ECHOING VOICE
                  All around the stactus plant...
                  The stalker chased the girly...

     Lilith finally pinpoints the voice. High atop the pile of
     dead vehicles... IS A 13-YEAR OLD GIRL. Ratty dress, leather
     duster, band-aid across the nose, headband, streaks of pink
     in her dirty hair. Is this-- ?

                              LILITH
                  Allara?

     Yeah, sure looks like it! But around here, she goes by:

                              TINY TINA
                  The stalker thought t'was all in fun...

     Tina gets a CRAZED LOOK of JOY in her eyes as she runs toward
     an old-school DETONATOR. She LEAPS INTO THE AIR--

                              TINY TINA
                  POP-- !

     She comes down HANDS-FIRST onto the detonator... Lilith RUNS
     and-- KABOOOOOM! A dozen LANDMINES EXPLODE around our hero!

                              TINY TINA
                  --GOES THE STALKER!

     Lilith hits the ground hard. Face full of dust. She gets back
     up just in time to see Tina KICKING A CRATE open.

                              LILITH
                  Allara! I'm here to save you!

                              TINY TINA
                  Allara? Nah, baby girl, my name's
                  Tina. I'm a little teapot, bloody and
                  cut... here is my CANNON--

     She pulls the tarp off some kind of HOWITZER.

                              TINY TINA
                  --and here is my BUTT.

     Tina then hits the BUTTON...   BOOM! Lilith SLIDES under the
     Outrunner.
                                                               29.



                         TINY TINA
             Where'd you go? I looooooove it when
             assassins drop by. Now I get to make
             it raaaiiiiin! With ya body parts.

                         CLAPTRAP
                   (still caged)
             Bleeding out yet?

Lilith, PISSED, rolls out from under the Outrunner.

                         LILITH
             ALLARA! I'm a friend -

                           TINY TINA
             Tinaaaaa...

                         LILITH
             Whatever. Listen, I'm not an
             assassin. I'm here to HELP you.

                         TINY TINA
             Uhhhhh, do I look like I need help?
             Cuz I'm up here and you're all
             "hidin' under a car" like a B-Y-ITCH.

That does it. Tiny Tina might be deadly, but she's also just a
child. And Lilith has had enough. She aims her gun at Tina.

                         LILITH
             You get down here right now or--

                          TINY TINA
                   (yelling to no one)
             OH KRIIIIIEEEEGGGGGG? This fancy-ass
             wimminz is pointin' guns at your best
             freh-end...!

CLANG. CLANG. CLANG. Deep ECHOES from within the pile of
vehicles. Lilith turns to the noise. Oh god. What now?

                         TINY TINA
             Oh this is gonna be good... for me.
             For you it's gonna be--

Tina makes FLESH RIPPING and EXPLOSION sounds. CLANG! A door
FLINGS OPEN, and we meet: KRIEG, a shirtless, thick-muscled
PSYCHO, face covered in a gasmask, only ONE EYE exposed.

                         CLAPTRAP
             Welp, it's been fun, but I can see
             where this ends, better to be leaving
             now...
                                                               30.



Claptrap starts to rattle the cage, trying to open it. Krieg
lifts his CLUB - a massive PIPE fitted with some hideous
SPIKED SAW BLADE at the end.

                         LILITH
             You're holed up with psychos?!

                         TINY TINA
             He only USED to be a psycho! Now he's
             my big BRUDDAAAAH! Cuz I'm SPECIAL!
             Now tell her what she's won, Krieg!

                         KRIEG
             I HAVE THE SHINIEST MEAT BICYCLE!

Lilith lowers her gun. What? Even Tina hangs her head.

                         TINY TINA
             Ugh. I told you Krieg, you gotta
             think this stuff through.

Krieg CHARGES AT LILITH, club RAISED... he LEAPS IN THE AIR,
she FIRES... he BLOCKS THE BULLETS with the SAW BLADE...
shit, this guy's good... Lilith dives aside, barely evading
the blade as Krieg SLAMS it down into the ground.

                         TINY TINA
             OH YEAH! It's BADONKADONK TIME!

WHAT? Well, that's what Lilith would have said, but Tina is
now firing GRENADES from a LAUNCHER. Lilith and Krieg
continue to SWING and SHOOT at each other, all while BOTH OF
THEM are EVADING the bombs raining down.

                         TINY TINA
                   (singing)
             Throw a few grenades at the fancy-ass
             stalker, blow stuff up and make
             people die...!

                         KRIEG
             MY STOMACH IS CLEAR AND MY MIND IS
             FULL OF BACON!

KABOOM! Grenades exploding everywhere. Only one way out of
this... and that's summoning Atlas. Lilith pulls out the
COMMUNICATOR, but gets BODY SLAMMED by Krieg...

The communicator goes flying... and lands on the ground. As
Krieg and Tina continue their assault...

                         LILITH
             CLAPTRAP!
                                                                31.



Claptrap tickles his own armpit with one hand, giggling,
snapping the cage open. He hops down, wheeling away, bunny
in claw-like gripper thingy.

                         CLAPTRAP
             Oh, I'm not part of this.

                         LILITH
             Yes you are!!!!

                         KRIEG
             I'LL LICK YOUR SPINE CLEAN!

                         TINY TINA
                   (holds an RPG)
             Oooh, look at this bad bitch!

Tina fires off a ROCKET. KABOOM!

                         LILITH
             CLAPTRAP!!! GET THE COMMUNICATOR!

                         CLAPTRAP
             "Claptrap get this. Claptrap get
             that." Just for once, I'd like to
             know you actually appreciated me.

                         LILITH
             WE MET YESTERDAY!

                         CLAPTRAP
             Oh fine.

Claptrap wheels off toward the communicator as Lilith DUCKS
another swing from Krieg. Then Lilith eyes the vehicle pile.
Gets an idea. She RUNS from Krieg, heading toward the pile...

                         TINY TINA
             Here's a rhyme, now it's time
             To blow ya mind up your behind...

Tina takes AIM at Lilith, but Lilith is now SCAMPERING up the
wall of vehicles. She realizes she can't hit Lilith, because
she'll bring the whole wall down, and her with it.

                         TINY TINA
             What? No fair! THERE ARE RULES IN THE
             MURDER BIDNISS!

Lilith grabs a chain, shoots out a counterweight, and she's
HOISTED all the way to:
                                                                      32.



42   EXT. THE TOP OF THE VEHICLE PILE - CONTINUOUS                    42

     Krieg can't do anything except yell from the ground.

                                KRIEG
                    I WILL EAT YOUR NEPHEWS!

     Lilith trains her gun on Tina. Tina trains her RPG on Lilith.

                                TINY TINA
                    Mine's is bigger.

     Lilith makes a bold choice. Slowly lowers her gun.

                                LILITH
                    Listen. Your father sent me.

                                TINY TINA
                    My parents are dead, lady.

                                LILITH
                    Your father: Deukalian Atlas.

                                TINY TINA
                    Uhhhhhh, my daddy's name was Alfredo
                    Frittata, he was killed by a psycho
                    named Flesh Stick, and his favorite
                    color was vanilla.

     Lilith pulls out the picture. It's her.

                                LILITH
                    Atlas is your father. This is you. Now
                    whatever's happened to your... mind--

                                TINY TINA
                    My mind is awesoooooome wut wut!

                                LILITH
                    Oh---kay. But we can make it even
                    better, if you come with--

     A bass RUMBLE. Lilith and Tina are immediately on HIGH ALERT.
     The rumble turns LOUDER... and now it's the sound of dozens
     of MOTORS... and on the CLIFF RIDGE, we see:


43   EXT. TUNDRA EXPRESS QUARRY - CLIFF RIDGE - DAY                   43

     OUTRUNNERS   AND DAHL STINGRAYS - badass dune buggies and
     hovercraft   with mounted turrets. Each driven by a SOLDIER IN
     RED ARMOR,   a mix of men and women. And every one of those
     turrets is   TRAINED ON LILITH.
                                                                   33.



                              TINY TINA
                  Daaamn, stretch. You are unnpopulaaah.

     A SOLDIER emerges from the lead outrunner. Helmeted, but we
     can see her face. This is COMMANDANT STEELE, 40, eats shit
     like you for breakfast, and in a terrible fucking mood.

                              STEELE
                  When I saw the Atlas dropship, I
                  figured he'd sent someone new to find
                  the girl... but I never thought it
                  would be a scumbag bounty hunter.


44   EXT. TUNDRA EXPRESS QUARRY - DAY                              44

     Claptrap WHEELS INTO VIEW, far below Steele.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  Actually, she's not a scumbag bounty
                  hunter. She's a scumbag thief!


45   EXT. THE TOP OF THE VEHICLE PILE - DAY                        45

     Tina registers surprise at that. A thief? She's looking at
     Lilith with a strange new curiosity...

                              CLAPTRAP
                  Also, you should know that if I
                  could, I would definitely switch
                  sides right now.

     Lilith FIRES A SHOT down at Claptrap. PING!

                                 CLAPTRAP
                  See why?

                                 LILITH
                  Who are you?

                              STEELE
                  Commandant Steele of the Crimson
                  Lance. And thank you-- really-- for
                  leading us to the girl. Sorry to say
                  only one of us can take her back to
                  Atlas and get a ride off this planet--
                  and it's gonna have to be me.

                              TINY TINA
                  Oh yeah? You and what army?
                                                                     34.



                              STEELE
                  The army that I'm in? Which is here?

                                TINY TINA
                  Oooh, she's good.

                              LILITH
                        (guarding Tina)
                  Just stay behind-- hey what--?

     Tina has come around to stand in front of Lilith. Guards her.

                              TINY TINA
                  Don't be scurred. Check it out.

     Tina nods toward: TWO STUFFED BUNNY RABBITS... if you can
     call them that. More like stitched-together monstrosities.
     But right now, they're strapped to VERY LARGE MORTAR ROCKETS.

                              TINY TINA
                  That's Mushy Snugglebites and Felicia
                  Sexopants. These ladies got a gut
                  fulla dynamite and a booty like POW!

                                LILITH
                  Don't--

     But Tina's already pulled a REMOTE out. And hit the button.
     She looks back at Lilith. Don't what now?


46   EXT. TUNDRA EXPRESS QUARRY - CLIFF RIDGE - DAY                46

     MUSHY SNUGGLEBITES and FELICIA SEXOPANTS roar to life and
     ROCKET UP INTO THE AIR. They ZIGZAG CRAZILY IN THE SKY, then
     start heading back, HOMING IN ON THE LANCE. Steele HOPS into
     her OUTRUNNER, and she and EVERYONE ELSE in the Crimson Lance
     try to RACE OUT OF THE WAY, as--

                              KRIEG
                  POUNDS! OF! FLESSSSSSHHHHH!

     BOOOOOM! The mortars SLAM into the CLIFFSIDE, sending it--
     and THE LANCE-- SLIDING DOWN and COLLIDING into--

                              TINY TINA
                  Ohhhhh that's why you said "don't"...


47   EXT. THE TOP OF THE VEHICLE PILE - DAY                        47

     --THE VEHICLE PILE, which begins to COLLAPSE DOWN. Lilith and
     Tina begin to DROP with the TRUCK they were on top of...
                                                                     35.



                                 LILITH
                  ALLARA!

                                 TINY TINA
                  NOT MY NAME!

     They're both RUNNING UP the truck as the truck is SLIDING
     DOWN... while Crimson Lance vehicles fire TURRETS at falling
     vehicles so they don't get CRUSHED. It's like Buster Keaton in
     his classic film "Holy Shit This Is Fucking Nuts" (1935).

     Lilith and Tina HANG ON and SURF THEIR WAY DOWN. The truck
     LANDS wheels first on the ground, and they're both TOSSED OFF.


48   EXT. TUNDRA EXPRESS QUARRY - DAY                            48

     Lilith hits the ground hard. Like the fourth time today. SOUND
     GOES OUT - shellshock... she looks around, vision TILTED... sees
     STEELE is driving toward them - TURRET READY to kill her... This
     is it? This is how I die??? What a bunch of bullshit.

     THE TURRET AIMS... STEELE PULLS THE TRIGGER, and... SCREEEEE! A
     HUGE TRICKED OUT VEHICHLE - THE BANDIT TECHNICAL - SKIDS TO A
     STOP in front of Lilith... its armor BLOCKING THE SHOT! The
     door opens. It's-- ROLAND! From the poster! Except his face is
     covered with a gaiter, so Lilith doesn't quite see it yet.

                                 ROLAND
                  Get in!

     A HAIL OF BULLETS showers the OTHER SIDE of the Bandit
     Technical. No time to question. Lilith grabs TINA by the arm,
     and throws her into the Technical. Krieg rushes to join them,
     jumping in with Lilith. Lilith Behind Roland, Krieg behind
     Tina.


49   INT. BANDIT TECHNICAL - DAY                                 49

                                 KRIEG
                  DEATH BIRTH!

     As soon as they're in, MYSTERY GUY punches it... CLAPTRAP
     wheels after them. BULLETS firing all around him.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  Lilith! Wait for me! I'm your best
                  friend! Remember?

     IN THE TECHNICAL... Roland turns to Lilith. Well?
                                                                       36.



                               LILITH
                  Leave him.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  I have the communicator!!!!

     IN THE TECHNICAL... ah, shit. Lilith pushes the wheel,
     causing the Technical to SPIN to a stop. Tina FLINGS OPEN the
     door, Krieg GRABS CLAPTRAP and PULLS HIM IN... Tina sees the
     headless bunny and grabs it, snuggling it.

                              TINY TINA
                  Headless Freddie! You found her!

     ...and they PEEL OUT AGAIN.


50   EXT. TUNDRA EXPRESS QUARRY - DAY                              50

     STEELE watches with white-hot rage as the Technical drives
     off. Then she hops back in the saddle, hits the
     AFTERBURNERS... the rest of the Lance does, too, and:


51   INT./EXT. HERE WE FUCKIN' GO - DAY                            51

     THE CHASE begins. Our heroes (who mostly   all hate each other)
     in the Bandit Technical, pursued at HIGH   SPEED by STEELE and
     THE CRIMSON LANCE... We INTERCUT between   the chase and the
     interior of the TECHNICAL, which swerves   WILDLY to avoid the
     INCOMING FIRE.


52   INT. BANDIT TECHNICAL - DAY                                   52

                              ROLAND
                  Need someone on that turret!

                               TINY TINA
                  OOOOH ME!

     Lilith pulls a gun on her.

                               LILITH
                  Sit down!

                              TINY TINA
                  Really? Y'alls save me, now you wants
                  to shoots me? I'm scuuuuuurrrrd.

     Krieg puts his BLADE CLUB to Lilith's throat.
                                                                37.



                          KRIEG
             BLOOOOOOD!

Roland puts a gun to Krieg's head (steers with the other).

                         ROLAND
             Easy, big fella! (To Lilith) Lower
             the Vladof.

Claptrap just looks around at all of them, crammed into this
vehicle, weapons at each other's heads, and EXPLOSIONS
impacting all around them.

                         CLAPTRAP
             This is very on brand for Pandora...

Lilith thinks. Then shifts her aim to Roland's head. He shifts
his aim to Lilith. Krieg shifts his BLADE CLUB to his own
throat. Tina CLAPS at that. WHOOHOO! So much fun!

                         LILITH
             You saving us, or are we hostages?

Roland lowers his gun. Pulls down his gaiter, revealing a
grizzled veteran, 40, but instantly readable as a decent man.

                         ROLAND
             I'm saving the girl, you're along for
             the ride. But right now we have more
             pressing issues.

PING! BANG! They're shot at, everyone remembers who they're
actually fighting.

                         TINY TINA
             Uhhh... how do you peeps keep missing
             this?

She opens her jacket to reveal LOADS OF GRENADES AND SUCH.

                         TINY TINA
             I'm the Mayor of BlowUpYourButtville
             Citytown? So I don't really need--

BOOM! Another volley ROCKS the Technical...

                          LILITH
             How did you manage to piss off an
             entire army?
                                                                38.



                         ROLAND
             Used to ride with the Lance. But,
             things changed when I learned about
             her.

Roland glances at Tina, grows serious.

                         ROLAND
             Daughter of Eridea.

                         LILITH
             God. Kill me now.

                         ROLAND
             "Only a Daughter of Eridea shall use
             the keys to open the - "

                         LILITH
             No, no, stop it-- let me out -

                         ROLAND
             "--and open the Vault and inherit the
             great gift! Treasure beyond
             treasure!"

                         TINY TINA
             It's true! I'm special. I am
             SPESHUUUUULLLLL and I'm gonna find
             the vault and open the vault and get
             in the vault and do a somersault--

WHABOOOOM! CLOSER!

                         KRIEG
             TANDEM PUMPERNICKEL!

                         LILITH
             If you're truly here to save her then
             QUIT PREACHING AND SAVE HER ASS.

                         ROLAND
             Take the wheel.

Roland pulls a lever and EXTENDS THE WHEEL back to Lilith,
who leans in and steers from the back seat

Roland pulls another lever, engaging the gas - SPEEDING UP.
The entire vehicle has manual "auto pilot" functions. He
operates it all with incredible agility, speed, and skill.

Like cat, Roland jumps up spins around backwards, popping out
the window, on the sill, legs inside, FIRING AT THE LANCE.
                                                                  39.



53   INT. STEELE'S OUTRUNNER - DAY                                53

     Steele, behind him driving, dodges, firing back.

                              STEELE
                  PLAYER! WHAT. ARE. YOU. DOING?!?


54   INT. BANDIT TECHNICAL - DAY                                  54

                               ROLAND
                  INCOMING.

     Lilith steers, shots missing. Roland shoots A SMALL ROCKET
     LAUNCHER. As Lilith leans over to steer, Tina TICKLES her.

                              TINY TINA
                  Who's ticklish?

                              LILITH
                  Hey. HEY. STOP THAT. STOP IT.

     Lilith ELBOWS Tina off.

                               TINY TINA
                        (the bombs in her jacket)
                  Careful, stretch. Someone hits one of
                  these badonkadonks, they're gonna
                  have to redraw the map.

                              LILITH
                  Ain't happening, cause we're getting
                  the hell off this planet RIGHT NOW.
                  Claptrap! The communicator!

     Tina leans back, tickling Krieg.

                              TINY TINA
                  I know Kriegypie's ticklish...

     She tickles Krieg, he loves it, banging his hands. Lilith
     swerves. Roland loses balance, almost falling out.

                              ROLAND
                  WATCH THE DAMN ROAD!

     Tina puts her hands over Lilith's eyes.

                              TINY TINA
                  She can't right now!
                                                               40.



                         LILITH
                   (swats her away)
             STOP IT! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!
             Claptrap - THE COMMINICATOR, NOW!

                            CLAPTRAP
             Here you go!

Claptrap passes the communicator to the steering Lilith.

                         TINY TINA
             Are robots ticklish? Woogie woogie...

Tiny Tina reaches under Claptraps armpits tickling
Claptrap... and his PINCER HAND closes down on it, BREAKING
THE COMMUNICATOR with a CRUNCH. Everyone stares.

                         CLAPTRAP
             Well. I did mention there was a 38%
             chance of that happening.

                            TINY TINA
             BOOYAH!

Krieg and Tina laugh like this is the funniest thing in the
world. Lilith briefly considers blowing her own head off in
pure frustration... but the INCOMING FIRE makes it clear
there's only one thing she can really do.

                         LILITH
             You programmed to steer???

She hands Claptrap the wheel, and stands, popping out of the
turret, face to face with Roland.

                         LILITH
             We have a problem.

                         ROLAND
             Yeah I'll say. WHO'S DRIVING?

Claptrap steers. Tina tries to tickle him, but Claptrap uses
an arm to swat her away. Krieg giggles.

                         CLAPTRAP
             Danger. Not safe. Not funny.
             Seatbelts everyone!

Lilith starts FIRING BACK at the pursuing CRIMSON LANCE
OUTRUNNERS. Lilith and Roland actually make a great team.
Each one impressed with the other's shooting skills.
                                                                     41.



55   EXT. PISSWASH GULLY - DAY                                      55

     HIGH VIEW - an army of vehicles chasing their single prey.
     They're entering a long ROCKY VALLEY lined on either side by
     long-abandoned scaffolding and PIPEWORK.


56   INT. BANDIT TECHNICAL - DAY                                    56

     BACK IN THE TECHNICAL--

     Roland drops down, pulling Lilith.   He takes the wheel.

                              LILITH
                  We're trapped, there's too many, we
                  can't get around them.

                              ROLAND
                  Not without some help. HANG IN.

     Tina sniffs the air. Yuck. Krieg smells it too. Likes it.

                              KRIEG
                  OOOOH, BREATHE IN THE PAIN SAUCE!

                              LILITH
                  That ain't pain sauce. That's
                  Pisswash Gully. You have any idea
                  what we're heading into?!?

                              ROLAND
                  Unfortunately I do.


57   EXT. PISSWASH GULLY - DAY                                      57

     SPLASH! The Technical ZOOMS by, splashing our lens with the
     lovely drainage still pouring out of those pipes.


58   INT. BANDIT TECHNICAL - DAY                                    58

     IN THE TECHNICAL - Lilith's back in her seat. BUCKLES UP. The
     ground starts RUMBLING... and the Technical starts
     SHUDDERING. Lilith isn't surprised. Neither is Roland.

                              LILITH
                  They're following...
                                                                     42.



59   EXT. PISSWASH GULLY - DAY                                      59

     And then: CRAAAACK! A monster-- a PANDORAN THRESHER-- erupts
     from below. What does it look like? Imagine the kind of
     monster that would live underground in a place called
     Pisswash Gully. Any more stupid questions? I mean, come on.

     Roland spins in CONTROLLED HYDROPLANE, around the Thresher.

     The Lance Outrunner behind them gets caught in the wet slick
     of Thresher piss, spinning out. Tina smells the breeze.


60   INT. BANDIT TECHNICAL - DAY                                    60

                                 ROLAND
                  ROLL IT UP!

                              TINY TINA
                        (rolling up her
                         sleeves)
                  Whoa, those things really smell like -

     SPLASH. Liquid, that shall not be named here - spills into
     the technical. Everyone EEEEEWWW. Tina LAUGHS.

                              ROLAND
                  I MEANT THE WINDOW! ROLL UP THE DAMN
                  WINDOW!

                              KRIEG
                  SARDINE SHOWERS!


61   EXT. PISSWASH GULLY (VFX) - DAY                                61

     Roland SWERVES, barely avoiding the THRESHER ATTACK. CRACK!
     More THRESHERS explode up, WHIPPING their nasty TENTACLES.


62   EXT. PISSWASH GULLY - DAY                                      62

     The Bandit Technical spins in a donut, winding up Face to
     Face with STEELE.

     Steele's eyes narrow as she floors it, but a WAVE OF THRESHER
     PISS sends her vehicle hydroplaning.

     BEHIND THE TECHNICAL - few CRIMSON LANCER STINGRAYS get taken
     out by MORE THRESHERS... a few Wilhelm Screams later, and it
     becomes clear... this entire gully is INFESTED... Lilith
     keeps her eyes peeled. Watching the shimmering of the PISS
     POOLS up ahead... signs of impending THRESHING...
                                                                     43.



     Roland Floors it, trying to keep it steady. The Outrunners
     flanking him now, coming at him from all sides. Then,
     another flash of piss - EVERYONE goes spinning now.


63   INT. BANDIT TECHNICAL - DAY                                    63

     The crew screams, but Roland keeps his cool, shifting gears,
     hitting buttons, activating burners, thrusts, air vents,
     anything to keep control of the truck.

                              LILITH
                  YOU GOT A PLAN TO GET US OUTTA HERE
                  OR WE GONNA SWIM OUR WAY OUT?

     Straight ahead... A LARGE BUBBLING... WHIRLPOOL.

                              ROLAND
                  There. We get out there. We just -


64   EXT. PISSWASH GULLY (VFX) - DAY                                64

     BOOM. A GLUTTONOUS THRESHER EXPLODES UPWARDS... this is the
     biiiig mamajama of Threshers...It roars, the whirlpool in
     front of it.


65   INT. BANDIT TECHNICAL - DAY                                    65

                              TINY TINA
                  Whoa. That's a lot of piss.

     Roland sees a ROOF SECTION, spinning among the debris in the
     whirpool. Round, and round and round. Lilith sees.

                                LILITH
                  Roland...

     Roland THROTTLES UP. He backs up the technical. The
     remaining Lance vehicles arranging themselves on the sides to
     block them in.

                              LILITH
                  What are you doing.

                                ROLAND
                  Have FAITH.

                              LILITH
                  WAITWAITWAITWAIT -
                                                                     44.



     Roland HITS THE AFTERBURNERS, PINNING THEM ALL BACK - heading
     right to the whirlpool - and the giant ass Thresher!

                              KRIEG
                  ALL ABOARD THE DEATH CHOOCHOO!


66   EXT. PISSWASH GULLY (VFX)- DAY                              66

     Roland white knuckles it as he drives RIGHT AT THE WHIRLPOOL,
     TIMING IT PERFECTLY TO HIT THE SPINNING ROOF.

     He hits the roof - FIRING REAR ROCKETS -   the momentum
     LAUNCHES THE TECHNICAL into the air...

     The Thresher OPENS ITS MOUTH TO SWALLOW THEM.

     The vehicle flies INTO THE CREATURE'S MOUTH, BREAKING OUT THE
     OTHER SIDE OF ITS HEAD with a SPLAT! The Technical smacks
     onto HIGH GROUND overlooking the Gully - and keeps going!


67   EXT. PISSWASH GULLY - DAY                                   67

     In the Gully, Steele watches, amazed, as the Big Mama
     Thresher DROPS DEAD. Once it does, the others retreat
     underground.   The Bandit speeds away, long gone. A Lance
     soldier runs up next to Steele.

                                  LANCE
                  Commander -

     She RAPID-FIRES HER GUN IN THE AIR, SCREAMING.

                              STEELE
                  AAAAAAHHHH!!! SON OF A TAINT!


68   EXT. PANDORA - WASTELANDS - DAY                             68

     Roland slows the car down to a stop behind some old scrap
     metal, hiding behind rocks.

                                  ROLAND
                  See?   Faith.

                              LILITH
                  That was luck, and skill, but
                  impressive... Kid, you okay?

                              TINY TINA
                  Yup. All good.
                        (holds up a pin)
                              (MORE)
                                                                     45.


                              TINY TINA (cont'd)
                  Just, mighta lost a grenade. But
                  let's not panic.

     Lilith and Roland are about to PANIC THE FUCK OUT, when... a
     MUFFLED KABOOM, and CLAPTRAP is bounced UP, hits the roof,
     and bounces back down.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  Found it!


69   EXT. WELL - DAY                                                69

     Everyone washes off by a well, which Roland also uses to pump
     water and clean off the Bandit. He makes some adjustments to
     the license plates and front bumper. Lilith eyes Tina.

                              LILITH
                  Now that they've seen her we have a
                  whole army after us.

                              ROLAND
                  You want me to hide her so you can
                  return to Atlas?

                              LILITH
                  I'm here for a job. I found her -

                              ROLAND
                  I came here for the same reason. But
                  do you know who she is? What she is?

                              LILITH
                  Yes. A girl. Not some descendant of
                  an alien race who can unlock a magic
                  vault that doesn't exist. Her dad is
                  Atlas, remember? He may not be
                  entirely human but he's not an
                  Eridian. We return his daughter
                  maybe he'll let the bounty on your
                  head slide and you can go free.

                              ROLAND
                  I'm already free. You're the one he
                  owns.

                              LILITH
                  Spare me the holier than thou speech.
                  You're as much of a criminal as I am,
                  you just wear a uniform.
                                                            46.



                         ROLAND
             You think he's just gonna let you
             walk once you give her back? So,
             what, you can rob him again?

                         LILITH
             What's the other choice, we all go on
             a magical treasure hunt?

                         ROLAND
             I'm not in this for treasure.

Claptrap presses a button on his chest. ROLAND'S RECORDED
VOICE from 5 minutes ago plays:

                         ROLAND (VIA CLAPTRAP)
             --Treasure beyond treasure!

Lilith raises an eyebrow: Well?

                         ROLAND
             You left out the salvation part. When
             a Daughter of Eridea unites the--

                         LILITH
             --yeah, yeah, the pieces of the broken
             key and opens the vault, some magic
             bullshit's gonna come tumbling out and
             save Pandora, we all read the scroll.
             If the Eridians were so brilliant then
             why would they care about saving the
             most worthless planet in the galaxy?
             CLAPTRAP.

                         CLAPTRAP
             I live to serve.

                         LILITH
             How long to fix that communicator?

Claptrap surveys the broken pieces.

                         CLAPTRAP
             Probably a day or two, depending on
             how quickly I can scavenge the
             necessary parts. Of course, killing
             people will make it go faster!

                         TINY TINA
             LET'S GO FAST!
                                                              47.



                         LILITH
             Let's try and not. Look, here's how I
             see things. This whole planet now
             wants us dead. But if they get you,
             we all lose. Now we can kill each
             other right now and save Steele the
             trouble--

Krieg raises his club again. Thrilled.

                         KRIEG
             HERE COMES THE BAD TIMES!

                         LILITH
             Orrrrr--

Krieg looks at Tina. Can I please kill her?

                         TINY TINA
             Not yet, bruh. Give her a sec.

                         LILITH
             I play make-believe with you all
             until this thing--
                   (Claptrap)
             --fixes that thing--
                   (the communicator)
             --and my ride shows up. You find your
             vault before then, congratulations,
             I'll even let you say "I told you
             so." If not, the meal ticket's coming
             with me.

Roland considers, turns to Tina.

                         ROLAND
             It's up to you, Daughter of--

                         LILITH
             Jeez, can we just maybe just stick
             with Tina?!

Off Tina, not failing to notice Lilith used her "real" name
this time instead of Allara. She grins, then:

                         TINY TINA
             We take the deal! Cuz she's a stone-
             cold suckaaaaaaaa! Everyone knows
             we're gonna find the Vault. You don't
             know. I'm special.
                                                                48.



That line again. But this time, pain in Tina's eyes. A young,
lost child's need for validation. I am special. But Lilith
isn't ready to give anything back. So:

                         TINY TINA
             You don't believe me? Fine.

Tina reaches into her coat. Everyone flinches... is it
explode-o'-clock again?

                         TINY TINA
             Maybe you'll believe this.

Tina pulls out-- her FIST to reveal AN ERIDEAN ARTIFACT. A
small piece of carved purple stone, flat on one side, curved
on the other, and covered in tiny RUNES that seem to GLISTEN
SLIGHTLY. It's beautiful. Lilith and Roland are stunned.

                         LILITH
                   (almost a whisper)
             Where did you...? My mother... she
             searched her whole life for...

                         TINY TINA
             Say it. Say what it is.

Lilith doesn't want to. Because it can't be.

                         ROLAND
             It's one of the Three Lost Pieces of
             the Vault Key. It's real. And you're
             the one who can open it.

Off Lilith: No. No, no, no. She shakes it off.

                         LILITH
             It's my job to know a fake when I see
             one, and that's a fake. So is she.

Roland takes her wrist. Reveals that TATTOO on her arm. The
same shape carved around the VAULT KEY PIECE.

                         ROLAND
             Is this fake?

She pulls her hand away with real strength. Now she's angry.

                         LILITH
             Even if that thing were real, and it
             isn't, you need two more. And no one
             on the planet knows where they are.
                                                                     49.



                              ROLAND
                  I know one person who might.

                              LILITH
                  And how do we get there with every
                  buzzard looking for this truck.

     Another truck approaches.   Roland looks up, smiling.

                              ROLAND
                  We catch a ride.

     SCOOTER, a trucker hat grease monkey, looks like he stepped
     out of a 1970's truck stop. His truck reads: SCOOTER'S
     SCRAPYARD: Engine Parts, Electrical & Fan Service. Scooter
     hops out, spitting on the ground.

                              SCOOTER
                  Well shit and meatballs, Roland, you
                  didn't tell me you's bringing ladies.
                  I woulda scrubbed up in my wash tub.

     Scooter removes his hat, smiling a greasy smile at Lilith.

                              SCOOTER
                  Y'all looks like you stepped right
                  out of a magazine, specifically one I
                  keep under m'passenger seat -

     Lilith pulls her gun, he shuts up. She gets in the truck.
     Roland hands Scooter the keys to the technical.

                              ROLAND
                  Try not to get it dirty. Or caught.

                              SCOOTER
                  Easy buddy, looky who's driving.
                  Ain't nobody gonna catch my riiide.

                              ROLAND
                  That's my ride, don't you forget it.


70   EXT. SANCTUARY - CITY GATE - DAY                              70

     Welcome to the BIG CITY! I mean , it's still a miserable heap
     built out of the exposed top portion of the long-abandoned
     Dahl™ Prime Mining Ship, but for Pandora, it's a metropolis.
     As the gang cruises by the city’s heavy DEFENSE GATE. Lance
     soldiers check cars going through the front gate.

     Roland gets on his radio. He slightly changes his voice,
     speaking in code for whoever's listening in.
                                                                    50.



                              ROLAND
                  Alley Cat, Alley Cat, do you copy?

     A woman in a sassy voice answers on the other end. Gamers
     will recognize her right away...

                              RADIO
                  Read you loud and clear Skag Pup.

     Everyone looks at each other. "Skag Pup?"

                              ROLAND
                  ...uh, nope, this is Phoenix. I'm
                  here with the delivery.

                              RADIO
                  HAHAHAHA (To others, nearby) He's
                  trying to get me to call him Phoenix.

                              ROLAND
                  I don't have time for games right now-

                  Cool your jets kiddo, we got you.
                  Sanctuary's crawling with insects so
                  we got a change of plans. Stash your
                  ride in bay two and we'll meet you
                  there...Phoenix.

     More raucous laughter.   Roland quickly shuts it off.

                              TINY TINA
                  So...Skag Pup -

                               ROLAND
                  PHOENIX.

     Awkward silence.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  I'm just excited to see what's behind
                  Door #2! My first city in 26 years!


71   EXT. DOOR #2 - NIGHT                                           71

     They pull into a door marked #2, into a giant garbage dump.
     There seems to be no system of organization whatsoever, just
     chutes dumping all kinds of trash into huge piles.

                              TINY TINA
                  Oooh yeah, skating in the barforama!
                                                                    51.



                              KRIEG

                              LILITH
                  This was actually a park when I was a
                  kid. Love what they've done with it,
                  this planet's really worth saving.

                              ROLAND
                  Just run fast and think of roses.


72   EXT. GARBAGE PILE - NIGHT                                      72

     The group runs through, coughing, sliding, covering their
     noses. Claptrap looks totally happy, garbage in his wheels.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  Luckily I have no sense of smell, but
                  I can feel the used tissues building
                  up inside of my electronic organs.

     They run up to a wall, where a rope ladder drops down. They
     begin to climb. They send Tina first, who climbs on Krieg's
     back as he climbs.


73   EXT. SANCTUARY - BACK WALL - NIGHT                             73

     They climb over a wall, where they're met by ELLIE, a big
     girl, early 20s, in overalls.

                              ELLIE
                  YOU MADE IT! Commere Skag Pup...

     She picks up Roland, squeezing him.

                              ROLAND
                  Don't...call...me...that...

                              ELLIE
                  Whew, you smell like a stinkbug in an
                  outhouse. Moxxi's waiting for y'all
                  at the bar. Y'all can put these on.

     Ellie hands them each strange looking COLLARS. Everyone puts
     them on, cycling through various holographic masks. Tina
     gets to one that's greyed out with a lock.

                              TINY TINA
                  I want this one!
                                                                    52.



                              ELLIE
                  I ain't spending ten bucks on a fancy
                  mask, pick one already there. And
                  Roland, I mean, Phoenix, drop them
                  drawers because the Lance'll spot
                  those fatigues anywhere. I got you a
                  change.

     Everyone puts on the collars, rotating through heads.


74   EXT. SANCTUARY - STREETS - NIGHT                               74

     Vendors. Street urchins. Folks scratching out a living. Hard
     faces and scowls. And a few Crimson Lance patrolling.

     Everyone's heads have now been replaced with holograms.
     Lilith wears "Horrorpunk," Krieg "Birdcollar," Roland the
     skully "Immort4l," (as well as a religious robe), Tina has
     the Frankenstein-ish "Simul4Crum," and Claptrap has an extra
     eye and fake mouth. They walk by relatively unnoticed.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  What a time to be sentient! Look -
                  telephones you can use to TALK with!

     They walk past Roland's HOLOGRAPHIC WANTED POSTER.

                              ROLAND
                  Who's that handsome devil?

                              CITIZEN
                  A bad-ass killer who'd make Nine Toes
                  brown his trousers. Reward just went
                  up to 150 grand!

     Roland looks at Tina as they pass.    She's impressed.

                              ROLAND
                  See? I'm special, too.

     Krieg looks at vendors selling strange animal food. He grabs
     a bite of BBQ meat, continuing. Nobody dares stop him.

                              KRIEG
                  CANNIBAL FROG CONVENTION!

                              ROLAND
                  Where’d you find him?
                                                                     53.



                              TINY TINA
                  The barrens. The other psychos left
                  him to die in a skag pit, so I took
                  him home and made him my friend.
                  Kriegy Poo! Make me tall!

     Krieg picks up Tina, putting her on his shoulders. As soon as
     she does, Tina SWIPES a pack of gum off a high shelf and
     pockets it before the proprietor can see.

                              LILITH
                  Tina, don't attract attention -

                              MARCUS
                  Hey, you owe me a monitor!

     Look at that, it’s Marcus! You know, the kooky bus driver
     from the beginning? He’s at a MARCUS TOURS & MUNITIONS kiosk.

                              LILITH
                  Never seen you before.

                              MARCUS
                  Nice try Miss Vladof Infinity, I
                  never forget a gun! What are you up
                  to now, Not-Vault-Hunter?

                              TINY TINA
                  She's Vault Hunting!

                              MARCUS
                  Ha ha! I knew it!

     Lilith flips them both off, keeps walking.


75   INT. MOXXI'S RED LIGHT - NIGHT                               75

     If a small military hanger had a three-way with the USCSS
     Nostromo and an unlicensed Irish pub it would be Moxxi's.

                              MOXXI (O.S.)
                  Sorry, y'all are too late, ugly happy
                  hour just ended.

                               ELLIE
                  Hey, ma.   Everyone, it's my ma.

     MOXXI walks over. 50's and still got it. Wedged into a red
     Victorian bustier. Mostly. Top hat on her head. Face?
     Powdered white. My god, the things she could do to you.
                                                                54.



                         MOXXI
                   (To Lilith)
             Moxxi. Probably don't remember me...

She puts her hand out to shake Lilith's, but instead pulls
her wrist a little and looks at the tattoo.

                         MOXXI
             ...but I sure remember you. Your mom
             was a good woman.

                         LILITH
             ...but a terrible mother.

                         MOXXI
             Come on in back, got something to
             show you. You too, sassypants.

                          TINY TINA
             Not without my Kriegy!

She pulls Krieg with her as they follow Moxxi.

                         KRIEG
             CINNAMON COMBAT SHARKS.

                         MOXXI
             He some kinda poet?

                         LILITH
             You get used to it.

Roland follows last.   Suddenly a hand on his shoulder.

                          VOICE
             Roland?

Roland reluctantly turns to see a fellow LANCE soldier. This
one, however, looks more like the computer nerd of the group.

                          LARRY
             Roland!   Oh man I knew that was you!

Roland turns off his collar, revealing his face.

                         ROLAND
             Larry! Hey buddy, great to see you!
             How'd you spot me?

                         LARRY
             Your boots, man! I drew those!

He points to the boots, which have a cool "R" drawn on them.
                                                                     55.



                              ROLAND
                  That's right you did!

     Roland carefully snaps his fingers for Claptrap, gesturing to
     go into his bag and get out a weapon.

                              LARRY
                  I heard everyone was chasing you
                  today! I was like, don't shoot him,
                  that's my roommie! Maybe I can talk
                  to Steele, you can still come back?

     Claptrap, below the bar seat, reaches into Roland's bag and
     hands up a wallet into Roland's expectant hand. Roland throws
     it back, miming a gun with his fingers. Claptrap then hands
     him shaving cream. Roland tosses it, his hand getting mad.

                              ROLAND
                  I don't think that's a good idea,
                  Steele's still kinda pissed at me.

                              LARRY
                  Yeah I'll say. You see the bounty
                  went up? What did you do to her?

                              ROLAND
                  Just...what I do best.

     Roland smiles, fake charming. He snaps at Claptrap, who
     picks underwear, breath mints - finally picking up a gun.


76   INT. MOXXI'S - BACK ROOM - NIGHT                            76

     Moxxi goes over a map of Sanctuary with Lilith.

                              MOXXI
                  ...Go up the steps but stay clear of
                  Dr. Zeds- I don’t know what that nut
                  has been cooking up in there. Around
                  the corner, take the alley, you'll
                  see the house on your right- the one
                  with all the fancy electronic locks.
                  Knock twice- password's ECHO.

                              LILITH
                  You sure it's safe to stay there?

                              MOXXI
                  Long as you can keep him quiet and
                  she doesn't blow the place up. (She
                  turns) How's that Lime Ricky honey?
                                                                     56.



     Krieg and Tiny Tina share a soda with two straws. They MMMMM.
     Moxxi smiles and turns back to Lilith, more serious.

                              MOXXI
                  Look, darling, for what it's worth, I
                  do know that your mother felt-

                              LILITH
                  - Don't. Please. I appreciate the
                  help. Let's just leave it at that.

     Moxxi nods, understanding.


77   INT. MOXXI'S RED LIGHT - BAR AREA - NIGHT                      77

     Roland and Larry laugh, mid-conversation. Both of them
     sloooowly readying guns behind their backs.

                              LARRY
                  Oh man it sure is great to see you,
                  old buddy. And I won't tell a soul.

                              ROLAND
                  'Appreciate that, Larry. I have a
                  pretty good feeling you won't.

     Larry pulls his gun when BZZZT. Moxxi SHOCKS Larry with a
     zapper. He drops to the ground, unconscious.

                              MOXXI
                  You should get moving.

                              ROLAND
                  Is he -

                              MOXXI
                  He'll have one hell of a hangover,
                  but he won't remember much. I set his
                  eggs for "scramble." Go on.

     They leave, saying thanks. As they exit, two Lance soldiers
     pass by and spot Larry on the floor. Before the soldiers can
     accuse anything, Moxxi turns on them, putting on an act.

                              MOXXI
                  HEY! Your buddy here just ran up one
                  hell of a tab and then passed out on
                  me! Who's gonna pay for those drinks?
                  Mr. Atlas? You?
                                                                     57.



     The Soldier steps up to Moxxi, gets in her face. She doesn't
     back down, but it's clear who would win this fight. He looks
     around the room, staring everyone down. Then fake smiles.

                              SOLDIER
                  Sorry ma'am, we'll take him.

     They pick up Larry and drag him out of there. Moxxi watches
     them go. The crowd goes back to drinking as usual.


78   EXT. SIDE ALLEY - SANCTUARY - LATER                           78

     The group turns into a quiet residential alley.

                              TINY TINA
                  Are we there yet? I gotta pee.

                                 LILITH
                  Hold it.

     Tina sighs, annoyed, and pulls out the gum she swiped.

                              TINY TINA (CONT’D)
                  Anybody not named Lilith want some?

                                 ROLAND
                  Affirmative.

     Tina passes Roland the gum, making sure to chew extra loud to
     annoy Lilith. Roland plays along.

                              ROLAND (CONT’D)
                  Mmmm. That’s some good gum right
                  there. You’re missing out, Lilith.

                              TINY TINA
                  Cool thing is your spit activates the
                  explosion.

     WHAT THE FUCK. Roland SPITS THAT SHIT OUT as Lilith grabs
     Tina, and SMACKS HER ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD, tossing it into
     the alley. HALF A SECOND LATER -- BOOM! BOOM! Dust. Rubble.

     People look out of their windows above. The group runs.

                              LILITH
                  Are you crazy?!?!?!

                                 TINY TINA
                  Uhhh. Kinda?

     They round a corner...
                                                                     58.



79   EXT. TANNIS' HOME - NIGHT                                      79

     They've arrived at a door... perhaps once a maintenance hatch
     in the mining ship.

                              LILITH
                  I think this is it.

     She knocks twice.

                                 LILITH
                  Echo.

     Nothing happens.

                              ROLAND
                  You sure that's the password?

                                 LILITH
                  Yes. ECHO.

                              TINY TINA
                  Maybe you're supposed to echo it.
                  Like "Echo echo echo..."

     The door buzzes open. Tiny strolls past Roland and Lilith.

                              TINY TINA
                  You foolz would literally be dead
                  without me.


80   INT. TANNIS' HOME - CONTINUOUS                                 80

     Soon as they enter, Lilith’s jaw drops. This place is like
     Tina's lair times a thousand. Not just maps and notes and
     plans. There are ERIDEAN ARTIFACTS here. TABLETS. ANCIENT
     SCROLLS. There are blueprints and soil samples and MOSAICS of
     ANCIENT ALIEN WOMEN...

     ...and that SHAPE. The same SHAPE on Lilith's arm. On almost
     everything. It's the one common symbol.

     Lilith stands there, awestruck. The rest of the gang
     continues around the corner--

                              TANNIS
                  Oh, good. You found the girl.

     --where TANNIS, 60, glances up from a workstation. Short
     silver hair, magnifying goggles on head, and the unblinking,
     steady gaze of a neuro-atypical scientist who sees a little
     less than you... but also a whole lot more.
                                                                59.



                         TINY TINA
             I'm Tina. Da speshulll one.

Tannis eyes Tina’s extended hand like it’s covered in warts.
She’s not the social type. Tannis just studies it.

                         ROLAND
             Tannis is a xeno-archaeologist. She’s
             been researching the vault for years.
             If anybody can help us, it’s her.

                         LILITH (O.S.)
             You.

They turn to see Lilith, who has just caught up. She stares
daggers at Tannis. Her worst memory flooding back. Chills her
to the bone. Tannis registers nothing. Until Lilith holds up
her arm and shows her tattoo. And at that, with zero emotion:

                         TANNIS
             Oh. Hello, Lilith.

                         ROLAND
             You know each other?

                         LILITH
             Unfortunately. I can't stay here.

                         TANNIS
             You smell like sewage and your wanted
             poster just went up. You'll be shot
             in minutes. I suggest you shower and
             settle in for the night.

Tannis gestures over to a stall in the corner. It looks like
a cross between a phone booth and a UV lamp for plants. Tina
jumps in and presses a button, which zaps her with light.

                         TINY TINA
                   (suddenly clean)
             WHOA, ZAPPY! Let's go again!

                         TANNIS
             Not recommended.

                         KRIEG
             SNIFFING TENNIS BALLS!

                         ROLAND
             I do have seniority -

Krieg, Roland and Tina all struggle for position in the
shower. The light zaps again. Tina's HAIR stands on end.
                                                                   60.



                               CLAPTRAP
                   Let me try! I need a spring cleaning-

                               TANNIS
                   It's ionostatic, not meant for-

     BZZZZT.   Claptrap spins around, on Robot speed.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   WHOA, FOURNINETHREESIXTWO CLAPTRAP
                   REEEBOOOOTING BOPBOPBOPBOP DINGDONG

     Lilith storms into another room and slams the door. Krieg
     goes to sit in an inconspicuous wooden chair--

                               TANNIS
                   Don’t sit on Clork!

     Krieg looks at the chair. It's just a chair.


81   INT. CRAMPED STUDY - NIGHT                                    81

     Lilith stares at the various maps of the planet, the mines.
     All vault related. Tannis comes in without her seeing.

                               TANNIS
                   ... You’re upset.

                               LILITH
                   Aren’t you perceptive.

                               TANNIS
                   Because of your mother.

                               LILITH
                   Because of you. All this mystical
                   fairy tale bullshit... She trusted
                   you. To take care of me, not leave me
                   with a bunch of pirates and run back
                   here and pick up where she left off!

                               TANNIS
                   It was what your mother wanted.

                               LILITH
                   She wanted you to abandon me? Her
                   dream was for me to become a thief
                   before I was 10, living in gutters,
                   learning to steal, how to kill?
                                                                     61.



                              TANNIS
                  How to survive. And you have. Well
                  done. It was the right decision.

                              LILITH (CONT’D)
                  I never took a job anywhere near this
                  sector, never a shuttle headed in
                  this general direction, AND YET...
                  somehow... I end up right back here.
                  With you. Of ALL PEOPLE.

                              ROLAND
                  Hell of a coincidence...

                              TANNIS
                  More like prophecy.

                              LILITH
                  The only prophecy coming true is that
                  I'm returning that girl to her father
                  and leaving you here to rot in your
                  "lab" chasing a fantasy.

     And before you have a chance to figure out exactly what the
     hell that's all about... there's the sound of AN ALARM.


82   EXT. SANCTUARY - CITY GATE - NIGHT                             82

     Night is falling. The guards are signaling the citizens to
     get inside the gate.This is a daily routine, but no one seems
     particularly comforted. For the citizens... nothing but fear
     at night.


83   INT. TANNIS' HOME - NIGHT                                      83

     Roland peers out a porthole window. The old and young hustle
     to get indoors. The able-bodied take up arms.

                              ROLAND
                  Krom still owns the night. I'll stand
                  watch.

                              LILITH
                  I'll take watch.
                        (glares at Tannis)
                  Feels a lot safer out there.
                                                                     62.



84   EXT. TOP OF TANNIS' HOME - NIGHT                               84

     Guards and armed citizens stand watch on rooftops, all
     illuminated by spotlights that scan the area around the city.
     A few LARGE ARTILLERY WEAPONS are manned by multiple guards.

     LILITH - on the roof, rifle in hand, staring out into the
     night with more than just anger. Memories.


85   EXT. SANCTUARY CITY - NIGHT                                    85

     IN THE DISTANCE - PSYCHO VEHICLES race by, their lunatic
     occupants firing wildly into the sky.


86   EXT. TOP OF TANNIS'S HOME - NIGHT                              86

     Lilith grips her gun tighter. Uncharacteristically rattled...

                              TINY TINA (O.S.)
                  You okay?

     She turns to see TINA standing by the access hatch that leads
     to the roof. Quickly puts the wall back up.

                              LILITH
                  Get back inside. It's not safe.

                              TINY TINA
                  I told you, I don't need your
                  protection. I'm special.

     Fine. Whatever. Lilith can't control this kid, and they both
     know it. Lilith turns back to her watch.

     Tina takes up watch on her own part of the roof. Weirdly
     looking back at Lilith, as if taking cues. Standing the way
     Lilith stands. Moving her eyes back and forth.

                              TINY TINA (CONT’D)
                  Can I ask you something.

                              LILITH
                  Do I have a choice?

                              TINY TINA
                  You were a thief. When'd you get
                  caught? Like a year ago?

                              LILITH
                  About then. Yeah.
                                                     63.



The two of them stay silent for a moment. Then...

                         LILITH (CONT’D)
             How did you know I was caught?

                         TINY TINA
             Claptrap told me.

                         LILITH
             No. He said I was a thief. He never
             said I got caught. Who are you? Your
             father is Deukalian Atlas. Isn't he?

                         TINY TINA
             ....... Yes and no.

                         LILITH
             It's not a "yes and no" question.

                         TINY TINA
             He's my...creator.
                   (off Lilith's shock)
             Atlas is bananapants obsessed with
             the Vault. He says only a daughter of
             Eridea can open it. He found a piece
             of the Vault key. And on that key...
             there was a tiny bit of blood.

                         LILITH
             Eridean blood. He cloned an Eridean.

                         TINY TINA
             THIS IS MY STORY I'M TELLING IT!
                   (shrugs)
             But yeah. And guess who that Eridean
             is? GUESS!

                         LILITH
             Is her name Tina?

                         TINY TINA
             Boom. But it's all good, I don't care
             I grew up in a lab. I never wanted a
             mother or a father. A big brother
             scaring off boyfriends. Pet Skag.
             Grandma making tea - barf.

                         LILITH
             He created you to open the vault.

                         TINY TINA
             Yeah, and I'm gonna open it before he
             gets there.
                         (MORE)
                                                      64.


                         TINY TINA (cont'd)
             He'll take whatever's inside and just
             make super weapons. That dude has
             issues.

                         LILITH
                   (putting it together)
             There were no "anarchists." You
             escaped.

                         TINY TINA
             I had to. I grabbed the Vault Key
             piece and snuck on a transport ship.
             He had us in this secret lab. On--

                         LILITH
             Phaeton.

                         TINY TINA
             Aight, that one was kinda cool the
             way you said it. Yeah. Phaeton. That
             "secret research facility?" The one
             you broke into?... I was the thing
             that was in it.
                   (Lilith reels)
             I saw you. On a security monitor. I
             mean, I couldn't make out your face
             real good. But I saw how you broke in-
             - and I used what I learned from you
             to break out... So anyhoohah, when I
             heard ClappityTrap say you were a
             thief and that Atlas had sent you? It
             clicked. And that's why I had to
             break the communicator.

Lilith turns. How smart is this girl?

                         LILITH
             On purpose? So you had a Claptrap?

                         TINY TINA
             Part of one, an old model I found. No
             voice or anything, but I learned a
             few tricks before it died out.

She turns to Lilith, with resolve.

                         TINY TINA
             If Atlas has me, he'll make me open
             the vault and then he'll lock me up
             in another secret lab to do more
             experiments. If you saw the things
             they did to the others...The rejected
             clones...
                                                                     65.



     She starts to tear up. Lilith instinctively puts her arm
     around her. A motherly instinct for the first time.

                               LILITH
                  Shhh.   It's gonna be okay.

     The BULLHORNS return, Krom’s marauders continuing their
     propaganda. A Pandoran lullaby.

                              BULLHORN PSYCHO
                  ALL WILL SUFFER THE RAGE OF KROM.

     Lilith peers out into the night, a far-away look in her eyes.
     We PUSH IN, that shiver-inducing voice echoing in her:


87   EXT. LILITH'S MEMORY - A SMALL VILLAGE - DAY                   87

     The same BULLHORN TRUCK. The same voice.

                              BULLHORN PSYCHO
                  ALL WILL SUFFER THE RAGE OF KROM.

     Fires in the distance. Screams. Pandora has fallen. The
     psychos are coming. A WOMAN, 30s, rushes with her 8-year-old
     daughter in her arms. We know them from the SPACEPORT
     BILLBOARD. This is YOUNG LILITH and LILITH'S MOTHER.

     AN OPEN JUMPSHIP is waiting, ready to take people away, like
     the last helicopter out of Vietnam. A younger TANNIS is on
     the ship, waiting. Lilith's Mother finally gets there, and--

                                YOUNG LILITH
                  MOOOOOM!!!!

                              LILITH'S MOTHER
                  I'm sorry, lily pad. I have to stay.
                  I have to find the Vault.

     --hands Lilith to Tannis. Lilith doesn't understand.
     Instantly overwhelmed with fear as her mother backs away.

                              LILITH'S MOTHER
                        (to Tannis)
                  Get her out of here.

                                YOUNG LILITH
                  No. NO.

     The gunfire is upon them. Tannis drags Lilith onto the
     getaway ship, even as she fights with all her might.
                                                                     66.



                              LILITH'S MOTHER
                  ALWAYS REMEMBER I LOVE YOU! MY
                  TREASURE BEYOND TREASURE!

     Lilith's Mother loads a gun. Races for her TRUCK to escape the
     madness. BUT AS THE OPEN JUMPSHIP RISES IN THE AIR, she sees:

     KROM. Lord of the Psychos arrives like a barbarian conqueror
     of old, riding atop a HUGE TANK. He aims a rocket launcher at
     her mother.

     Lilith screams... Her mother looks at Lilith as she rises up
     into the air. An explosion. And the end of everything.


88   EXT. TOP OF TANNIS' HOME - THE NEXT MORNING                    88

     Lilith AWAKENS with a jolt. Then she remembers. Looks around,
     no sign of Tina. Some primal instinct kicking into gear.


89   INT. TANNIS' HOME - DAY                                        89

     Lilith comes sliding down the LADDER:

                               LILITH
                  Tina!

     Tina looks up from the table. Mouth full of sugary Atlas
     brand SPLODEO'S™ cereal.

                               TINY TINA
                  Whuh?

     Lilith exhales, relief quickly turning to mild embarrassment.
     Roland has his guns laid out, cleaning them.

                              ROLAND
                  Chow down. Big day ahead.

                              LILITH
                  It's too quiet. Where's Claptrap?

                              TANNIS
                  At the market, getting parts for your
                  communicator. I couldn't stop him
                  from following your orders to fix it.

     A look between Tina and Lilith. Tina puts her spoon down.

                              TINY TINA
                  I'm not hungry anymore.
                                                                     67.



                              ROLAND
                  Tina, we're finding that vault today.

                              LILITH
                  I wouldn't get her hopes up if you
                  don't know where the key pieces are.

                                TANNIS
                  I do. Come.

     Tannis leads Lilith into her study.


90   EXT. BLACK MARKET - DAY                                      90

     Claptrap rolls through the market, strutting like Saturday
     Night Fever Travolta. He waves hi and greets the other
     robots, who steer clear of him.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  Hey baby, you speak binary?

     A robot GLITCHES angry robotic noises at him as he passes.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  Someone needs an oil change -

     He wheels by Moxxi's and sees Moxxi and Ellie with their
     hands spread out, flat on the bar. Two LANCE SOLDIERS behind
     them with guns trained on them. STEELE interrogates.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  Good morning!

     Moxxi shoots Claptrap a look, then refocuses Steele.

                              MOXXI
                  You think I don't want 150 grand? I'm
                  telling you, Roland was never here,
                  (re: Larry) this sorry sack was drunk
                  off his ass and now he's just making
                  up excuses.

     Ellie gives Claptrap the get the hell outta here look. Larry,
     a bit dazed, suddenly sees Claptrap, recognizing him.

                              LARRY
                  That's his robot! He was with him, I
                  told you, he's here!

     Steele turns, and just misses Claptrap. She runs out into
     the crowd, and can't see him, but by the way he's wheeling
     into people as he speeds away.
                                                                     68.



                              CLAPTRAP (V.O.)
                  'scuse me, coming through, got a
                  computer virus, highly contagious!

     Steele turns back to Moxxi, death stare. Signals for one
     soldier to come with her. Turns to Larry.

                              STEELE
                  Keep an eye on them. That's an order.

     Steele and the other solder chase after Claptrap, knocking
     people out of the way.

     As soon as Steele's gone, Larry turns to Moxxi, posturing
     like he's gonna boss her around, when Ellie SQUEEZES HIS HEAD
     IN HER HANDS LIKE A VICE GRIP. Larry shakes and drops to the
     ground, out cold.

                              MOXXI
                  Subtle, kiddo, I like it.

                              ELLIE
                  Aw, ma, you're embarrassing me.

                              MOXXI
                  Come on, we gotta warn them.

     Ellie slumps Larry over her shoulder, carrying him through
     the back door by herself. Moxxi follows behind.


91   INT. TANNIS' HOME - DAY                                      91

     A MOUNTAIN OF WEAPONS. Machine guns. Explosives. Combat
     rifles. Matter fact, just put all the in-game weapons on the
     damn table. Fan-service this shit up. Roland inspects and
     packs them, trying to stop Tina and Krieg from touching them.

     Tannis produces a DUSTY OLD JOURNAL from a high shelf.

                              TANNIS
                  Your mother left me this.

                              LILITH
                  ... Is that... her diary?

                              TANNIS
                  What? Don't be absurd. Your mother
                  wasn't some idiot sentimentalist. Did
                  you even know the woman?
                  Oh. Well, I suppose you didn't. You
                  were rather young when she was blown
                  up.
                              (MORE)
                                                              69.


                         TANNIS (cont'd)
             This is a mining journal she found.
             Left behind by a Dahl Corporation
             bureaucrat.

Tannis opens the journal. Lays it atop the weaponry. Page
after page of scribbled notes, lists, maps...

                         TANNIS
             He documented everything the miners
             found. Most of it, useless. But on
             this page... look.

She turns a page... a SKETCH...

                          LILITH
             The key...

                         TANNIS
             He thought it was a useless piece of
             Eridean pottery. The man had no clue
             he had found part of the Vault Key.
             So he catalogued it and stored it in
             a warehouse facility in the largest
             mine on Pandora.
                   (closing the journal)
             The Dahl Corporation abandoned their
             entire operation days later. And
             everything was left behind.

                         LILITH
             So if it’s still there why don’t you
             already have it?

                         TANNIS
             Because the mine is in Caustic
             Caverns.

                         CLAPTRAP (O.S.)
             ECHO ECHO ECHO, OH NEVER MIND, RUN!
             WE HAVE TO RUN! THEY'RE COMING.

Claptrap has burst into the front door and closes it behind
him. Krieg jumps up, ready for battle, slamming the door.

                         KRIEG
             MEAT PAJAMAS???

                         TINY TINA
             Easy, big daddy. Clappy, slow your
             roll, what the dillio?
                                                                    70.



                              CLAPTRAP
                  Steele, the one who really hates
                  Roland, which suggests the two of
                  them had some -

                              ROLAND
                  GET TO THE POINT.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  She was at the bar interrogating
                  Moxxi and Ellie with your friend
                  Larry. Was that his name? Seemed like
                  a decent roommate.

                              LILITH
                  Did The Lance see you?

                              CLAPTRAP
                  Luckily I have stealth mode so I'm
                  almost certain they didn't -

     POUNDING at the door.

                              STEELE (O.S.)
                  COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP. YOU HAVE
                  THIRTY SECONDS OR WE BLOW YOUR HEADS
                  OFF.

     Roland is already suiting up for battle. Tina grabs guns
     too. Lilith has to take them out of her hands.

                              LILITH
                  Is there another exit?

     They hear a metallic BANG from the BACK window. Bang Bang,
     like a metal lid banging a garbage can.

                              CLAPTRAP
                  A mating call!

     Tannis looks out the window, into an alley. Outside she sees
     Moxxi and Ellie, with a large garbage bin, waving them down.
     Two large men dressed as garbagemen stand with them.


92   EXT. TANNIS' HOME - DAY                                        92

     Steele gives the command to several soldiers who solder off
     the front door's locks and kick it in.
                                                                    71.



93   INT. TANNIS' HOME - DAY                                        93

     They break in and find...nobody home. Just something
     simmering on the stove. A liquid...Steele smells it. She
     looks around. Suddenly, she realizes she's in danger and
     covers her mouth.

                              STEELE
                  GET BACK, IT'S GONNA...!

     She turns to run, but stops...and yawns. Suddenly tired. A
     little dizzy. Delirious, even...

                              STEELE
                  ...one sec...Oh man, I'm really...can
                  we just... maybe just hold up a
                  minute? I didn't get a lot sleep last
                  night, just replaying the whole thing
                  in...pisswash...with Roland and...

     Steele passes out. The other soldiers look confused. They
     boiling steam fills the room, and they too yawn. One sits on
     Clork the chair like it's the best thing EVER.

                              LANCE SOLDIER
                  This chair feels like a
                  marshmallow...

     Clork collapses. And like that, they're all fast asleep.


94   EXT. STREETS - DAY                                             94

     Two workers roll the garbage bin through a back alley.


95   INT. GARBAGE BIN - DAY                                         95

     Roland, Tannis, Krieg, Tiny Tina and Claptrap all cram
     together inside the garbage bin.

                              LILITH
                  Is there any way to get in and out of
                  here that doesn't involve garbage?

                              ROLAND
                  Getting in isn't what concerns me,
                  it's getting - AAAAAHHH
                                                                     72.



96   INT. GARBAGE CHUTE - DAY                                       96

     And with that they are DUMPED DOWN A GARBAGE CHUTE. Sliding,
     sliding, sliding - landing in an outdoor pile.


97   EXT. GARBAGE DUMP - DAY                                        97

     They have to RUN through the trash to get to the truck,
     coughing and gagging on the smell.

     They make it to the truck. Roland jumps in to drive, but the
     wheels are slipping on the garbage.

                              ROLAND
                  We're stuck in the damn -

                              KRIEG
                  TOAD PUKE HYDROPLANE!

     Roland hits the gas again, and Krieg uses his super human
     strength to PUSH THE TRUCK, and get it running. Everyone
     jumps in.


98   EXT. SALT FLATS - DAY                                          98

     The truck drives through the barren salt flats.


99   INT. SANITATION TRUCK - DAY                                    99

     They ride in silence. Miserable.

                              TANNIS
                  Next time we should take the cotton
                  candy truck. I'll make a note.

     She pulls out a small note pad, and writes this down.
     Everyone glares at her, amazed. That was even an option?

     Tannis pockets the notebook and pulls out a small zapper,
     like a travel version of her shower. Everyone watches her, as
     she cleans herself. She now looks like she just came out of
     hair & make up, the others basically just left Burning Man.

                                 TANNIS
                  Much better.

     She sniffs herself and puts the zapper away. Everyone just
     stares at her. She doesn't quite get why everyone glares.
                                                                      73.



                               TANNIS
                   What. Did you guys want to use it?


100   EXT. SALT FLATS - DAY                                        100

      They walk from the truck to a small shack, near the base of a
      large abandoned mine. Roland carries the gun.

      Lilith hangs back with Claptrap. Looking at the IMAGE on her
      forearm. Wondering if she's been wrong this whole time...

                               LILITH
                         (re: communicator)
                   How long to fix it?

                               CLAPTRAP
                   I spoke at length with a half-broken
                   logic board at the market. I had to
                   learn her entire language from
                   scratch -

                               LILITH
                   The short version.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Just two more parts to completion and
                   we'll be ready to call Atlas and hand
                   his daughter over to him, thereby
                   satisfying whatever selfish urge
                   you're pursuing. Congratulations!

      Lilith looks Tina, who holds Krieg's machete handle, the
      blade end in Krieg's hand. They swing it together merrily.

                               LILITH
                   Just tell me when it's fixed.


101   INT. MINE SHAFT - DAY                                        101

      PITCH BLACK. Until... CREEEEEEAK! A PORTHOLE opens above us.
      Sunlight blasts inside. And five silhouettes peek down.

                               TINY TINA
                   HELLLLOOOOOOOO!

                                   TINY TINA'S ECHO
                   HELLLOOOOOO! HELLLOOOOO!   HELLLLOOOOOO!

102   EXT. MINE SHAFT - DAY                                         102

      In a valley between large promontories, the gang encircles a
      METAL HATCH etched into a small patch of concrete.

                               KRIEG
                         (into the hole)
                   ANUS OF THE WOOORRRLLD!!!

                                    KRIEG'S ECHO
                   OF THE WORRRLLD! OF THE WORRRLLD!

      Lilith facepalms.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Would you look at that! A ladder!
                   Unfortunately my design doesn't
                   facilitate this type of vertical
                   travel. Drats. Guess I'll--
                         (Roland kicks him in
                          the hole)
                   --AAAAAAAHHHH!!!

      Then Roland looks at everyone else. Shrugs.

                               ROLAND
                   Destiny awaits.

      One by one, they all climb down. When they're all in, Krieg
      pulls the hatch shut. And we get to see the "TOXIC: DO NOT
      ENTER. REALLY." warning on the other side...


103   INT. CAUSTIC CAVERNS - LATER                                  103

      A RIVER OF BUBBLING, BOILING, YELLOW-GREEN DEATH. It winds
      ahead, contained by a natural channel of PURPLE CRYSTAL, with
      a natural current moving DOWN and into a TUNNEL ahead.

                               TANNIS
                   Chemical waste from the mining
                   equipment. It eats through everything
                   but the natural crystal in the cavern.
                   Which is why we're going in that.

      An abandoned MINE BOAT - just a rusty tub carved into a large
      chunk of crystal. It's moored to the rocky "shore."

                                    KRIEG
                   MEAT SOUP!
                                                                      75.



      Excited, Krieg HOPS into the MINE BOAT. His impact pushes the
      mine boat down... the LIQUID DEATH alllllmost spills over the
      side... then the boat rises back up.

      Lilith scowls at him, then carefully lifts and places Tina in
      the boat. She follows. Then Tannis. And finally Roland. With
      each added passenger, the boat sinks lower. The liquid death
      is barely under the lip of the boat. Just five more pounds,
      and-- Claptrap wheels over, ready to come aboard.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Looks like there's room for--

      Everyone points a weapon at him. Do not get on this boat.

                               TANNIS
                   I have a job for you.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Hooray! Now I can watch you all melt
                   from a safe and reasonable distance!

      Tannis points to a RUSTY TRACK that rises up into a small
      access tunnel in the rock.

                               TANNIS
                   You're small enough to get in there.
                   Head through the tunnel, locate the
                   main access control, and find us a
                   way into the mine facility.

                                 CLAPTRAP
                   Can do!

                                 LILITH
                   Quietly.

                                 CLAPTRAP
                   No problem. I wouldn't want anything bad to
                   happen to each one of you in the most
                   horrifying way possible...

      With that lovely farewell, he WHEELS UP THE RAILING, and heads
      out of view. Tannis releases the catch that moors the boat,
      and they begin FLOATING along with the current into a...


104   INT. DARK SCARY TUNNEL - LATER                              104

      It’s A Small World's dastardly cousin.
                                                              76.



The gang drifts along. Tense. Silent, save for the gurgling
sounds of certain acidic death. A bat-like creature falls
from the top into the river, liquifying instantly.

Roland speaks in a quiet voice only Lilith can hear.

                         ROLAND
             You really gonna turn her over to
             Atlas? You can live with that?

                         LILITH
             You'd do the same.

                         ROLAND
             I did the same. For too damn long.
             Six months ago she was just another
             mission to me.

                         LILITH
             What changed?

                         ROLAND
             The way you felt in that prison?
             That's how I began to feel in the
             Lance. They rescued me from a bad,
             bad place, built me up, into this.
             The more missions I did, the more I
             made, the more worthless I felt. Then
             some kid showed me a drawing - of
             her, saving Pandora. I just thought,
             real or not, these kids have hope,
             and I'm here to take that away. Look
             where we are, and they have hope.
             And I thought I can help them, I can
             fight for them. Otherwise, what am I?

                         LILITH
             I used to have that same hope, dreams
             of my mom finding the vault. But once
             the treasure hunt makes you an
             orphan, it stops being fun. You
             realize it's all some lie, made up to
             distract you from the companies
             taking everything. And that's when
             you decide to start taking back.

                         ROLAND
             Sounds like you're the one who needs
             saving.

Tannis leans back, having heard everything.
                                                                        77.



                                 TANNIS
                     She does. But first she needs to stop
                     blaming her mother. It's the source
                     of her constant pain.

      A small BLUE CRYSTAL juts out from the eridium. The Mine Boat
      floats past it and... Did that CRYSTAL JUST MOVE? Fuck. It
      did. Like it was some UNSEEN MONSTER’S EYE. And-- wait a sec--
      yep, that was a GROWL. The creature watches them...


105   INT.CAUSTIC CAVERNS - MAKESHIFT DOCK - DAY                       105

      The mine boat floats slowly to the EDGE, where there's a
      makeshift dock built out of a crystal formation. They moor
      the boat and get out, stepping on to the dirt shore. Up
      ahead, a WALL OF METAL. On it, in huge letters:

      "DAHL MINING, the world is ours,"      with "ours" crossed out
      and KROMZ scratched over it.

                                 TINY TINA
                     Guys... look.

      They walk over to Tina, who is crouched on the rocky ground
      over: A TINY PANDORAN SAPLING, pushing through the parched
      soil here, in defiance of everything this place is.

      They all   stare at it. Even now, even here, they can't help
      but fall   prey to the most human of delusions. Hope. Until
      CLAPTRAP   emerges from an ACCESS TUNNEL above, and lands WHEEL-
      FIRST on   the sapling, CRUSHING IT.

                                 CLAPTRAP
                     Mission accomplished!

      They all stare in horror as he does THE TWIST in celebration,
      which means his wheel is GRINDING THE SAPLING into the dirt.

                                  CLAPTRAP
                     Who's the best? I'm the best! Give me
                     a job, I pass the test!
                           (notices them staring)
                     Well YOU'RE WELCOME.
                            (wheeling off)
                     Impossible to please...

      Up ahead, a DOOR in the huge wall opens as Claptrap
      approaches. Our heroes all look sadly at the DEAD SAPLING,
      then ready their weapons. Time to head in.
                                                                      78.



106   INT. ENTRANCE TO THE MINE AREA - MOMENTS LATER                106

      They move carefully down a corridor. Rusty scaffolds line the
      walls. After a few steps, Krieg STOPS dead. And puts a hand
      out to stop Tina from walking further. He's scared. He's
      looking at: RED PAINT smeared on a rock. The shape of an EYE.

                               KRIEG
                   Scream showers...

                               ROLAND
                         (studies it)
                   Bloodshots. Might still be here.

      Tina gets excited. Opens her jacket. Loads of BOMBS.

                               TINY TINA
                   Let's go find out.

                               LILITH
                   No bombs.

                               TINY TINA
                   I'll be surgical!

                               LILITH
                   No bombs. Not yet. Let me and Roland
                   scout first. I know-- you can handle
                   yourself. But there's only one of you
                   in the whole world. And you're special.

      First time she's said it back to Tina, who sort of pretends
      to be sulky about being protected, but mostly? Heart full.


107   INT. ATOP THE SCAFFOLDING - MOMENTS LATER                     107

      Lilith and Roland's heads peeks over the top, looking at the
      BLOODSHOT PSYCHO STRONGHOLD. A ramshackle settlement of
      abandoned vehicles, shipping containers and scrap metal.

      Scattered about: PSYCHOS, all with the BLOODSHOT SYMBOL on
      their chests and armor. Cooking skagmeat, peeing off ledges,
      chasing TINKS with FLAMETHROWERS-- you know, the usual.

      Roland sinks back down behind the top of the scaffolding to
      stay out of sight. Lilith joins him. Can see he's tense.

                               LILITH
                   You've dealt with them before?
                                                                   79.



                               ROLAND
                   Once, near Titan's End. We   barely
                   survived. That was with an   army. I
                   don't know what being down   here does,
                   but they get an extra dose   of crazy.


108   INT. ENTRANCE TO THE MINE AREA - MOMENTS LATER              108

      Lilith and Roland return to the rest of the party.

                               ROLAND
                   We need a way around. There's too
                   many to shoot through.

                               LILITH
                         (eyeing Tina)
                   Or blow up.

                               TANNIS
                   We can't blend in, we look nothing
                   like them. (To Krieg) Except you,
                   handsome.

                                  KRIEG
                   Dental farm.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   According to my calculations, the
                   odds of a successful stealth
                   operation in this scenario is... zero
                   percent. Wow! You never see that!
                   Impressive!

                               LILITH
                   ... Did you factor in a distraction?

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Of course! I analyzed sixteen million
                   versions where one of you creates a
                   distraction. Total failure!

                               LILITH
                   No. Not one of us.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Sorry what was that now?


109   INT. BLOODSHOT STRONGHOLD - MOMENTS LATER                   109

      A Bloodshot Psycho waddles out of his makeshift hut, huge
      MACHINE GUN in hand. Then stops as he hears:
                                                                80.



                         CLAPTRAP (O.S.)
             Good morning!

Dozens of Psychos turn at once to see: CLAPTRAP, wheeling
right up to the middle of their stronghold.

                         CLAPTRAP
             I am here because I want to be, and
             not for a more justifiable reason,
             like trying to be a distraction!

TO THE SIDE - our heroes - moving silently, single-file
behind a shack. Lilith glares at him. Idiot.

THE PSYCHOS - transfixed. Staring at Claptrap in confusion.

                          CLAPTRAP
             Even though it makes NO SENSE for me
             to say what I'm about to say, and
             even though ANYONE RATIONAL would
             suspect it was just part of a crude
             plan, I have decided ENTIRELY ON MY
             OWN to say the following.
                   (hangs his "head", then)
             Y'all bitches need to eat your own
             butts with your--

ANGLE ON: Tina, on the side, mouthing along with him...

                         CLAPTRAP (O.S.)
             --poopy mouthed ass-faces--

BACK ON CLAPTRAP:

                         CLAPTRAP
             --until you die from loser poisoning
             like the stupid pus-crotches that you
             "is." Also...
                   (the heaviest sigh)
             Your mothers are apparently made of
             "fart sauce." Again, with just a
             moment's thought, it should be
             painfully obvious that--

And that's the last word he gets out before A THOUSAND
BULLETS rain down on him. Claptrap FLOPS OVER, tries to wheel
away, gets PINBALLED back and forth by bullets, as OUR HEROES
SKEDADDLE. They duck through the stronghold UNSEEN, while:

In the B.G., psychos WHEEL A MAKESHIFT CANNON into view. Oh,
this is gonna be good...
                                                                     81.



                               CLAPTRAP
                   Hey, HEY! Not in the undercarriage!

      IN THE RIVER - The blue creature, hearing the gunfire, moves
      towards the noise.


110   INT. BEYOND THE BLOODSHOT STRONGHOLD - LATER                  110

      Our heroes climb up into view, onto a raised area beyond the
      stronghold. BANGBANGBANGBANG. The psychos are really giving
      it to poor Claptrap.

                               TINY TINA
                   Is he gonna be okay?

      wha-BOOM! The sound of CANNONFIRE, and our heroes watch as
      something is shot out from the stronghold, arcing across the
      massive cavern, heading toward--

      Lilith GRABS Tina and yanks her out of the way just before:
      CLAPTRAP lands at their feet like a mortar shell. Tumbles
      head over wheel for a bit, then wobbles back up.

                               LILITH
                   So much for your zero percent.

      He wheels slowly up to her. Pissed. Looks her in the eyes.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   You're not out yet.

                               TANNIS
                         (pointing ahead)
                   It's in there.

      Tannis steps towards a HUGE warehouse door when - PING. They
      stop, hearing a noise. Ping. Ping. They turn to see Claptrap
      expelling bullets from his back side.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   What? I'm expelling the excess lead.
                   How else is it supposed to exit my
                   body?

      They wait for him to finish, then turn back to walk when
      PINGPINGPINGPINGPING. They freeze, hoping this will end.

      ...standing still, waiting for it...all good, back on the
      move- PINGPINGPINGPINGPING.

      Tiny Tina and Krieg are about to explode in laughter. Lilith
      is ready to shoot him again.
                                                                      82.



                               CLAPTRAP
                   What? How is this funny? I fail to
                   see the humor.

      Ping.


111   INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER                                        111

      DARKNESS gives way to light as a door CREAKS OPEN. CRATES
      visible. Dead silent. Lilith leads the others inside.

                               TINY TINA
                   Sweet. So... the key piece is in one
                   of these crates. One of these--

      They sweep their lights across the room. There are HUNDREDS
      AND HUNDREDS of crates in here.

                               TINY TINA
                   --kabillion crates.

                               ROLAND
                   This could take a minute.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Four days if you work around the
                   clock, which you can't, because your
                   bodies require rest every sixteen
                   hours. Laaaazzzzyy...

      Lilith doesn't pay attention, moving through rows of crates.
      Something under her skin...almost like a compass, guides her.

      She stops, takes two steps back. Crouches down. In between
      two large crates, a smaller metal box. She flips the lid off
      and looks inside. Rocks, mostly.

      She dumps rocks out, reflected light glittering in her eyes.
      Tina notices, and sees the glowing object. She tugs at
      Tannis' shirt, pointing, but Tannis is busy bickering with
      Roland.

                               TANNIS
                   ...that's senseless, have to search
                   by size, they wouldn't store a small
                   piece in a large -

                               ROLAND
                    - I've been raiding my whole life,
                   we start left and sweep right -
                                                                83.



                           LILITH (O.S.)
             I have it.

They swing their lights to see Lilith, who holds up... A KEY
PART. Identical to the one Tina has.

                         TANNIS
             How did you...?

Lilith shrugs. Odd. She's not really sure herself.

                         LILITH
             I guess... I'm just lucky.

You know, this is the kind of story where no one ever seems
to catch a break, so let's just take a moment to feel GOOD
about this. There was a plan, it worked, she found the--

Oh. Shit. I'm suuuper sorry, but a huge BLUE CRYSTAL HAND has
just PUNCHED its way up through the floor and GRABBED LILITH.
Introducing... the CRYSTALISK! Think Mighty Joe Young, but
mostly made of crystal and insane. Roland AIMS his gun, but
there's no way he can fire without risking killing Lilith.

                         LILITH
             Get Tina out!

Lilith THROWS the key piece to Roland.

                           LILITH
             GO!

SLO-MO: Roland PICKS UP TINA, who reaches out in panic at
Lilith, who is going to die. We've seen this before...

But Tiny Tina isn't Tiny Lilith. Tiny Tina is a goddamned
lunatic clone-made daughter of Eridea with a few megatons in
her jacket, and that THING isn't taking her Lilith away.

So she flips the pin off the STICKY GRENADE in her hand, and
FLINGS IT... and we watch it arc past Lilith's face and land
squarely on THE CRYSTALISK'S BUTT.

                           TINY TINA
             Crack shot!

AN EXPLOSION - as the Crystalisk's ass is blown apart, along
with the rest of him, in a shower of blue ickyness. Lilith
hits the ground. Holy shit. Looks at Tina. Thank you.

But no time for handshakes and air kisses, because the ground
is rumbling, and so everyone RUNS...
                                                                      84.



112   EXT. ESCAPE FROM CAUSTIC CAVERNS - 0% CHANCE OF SURVIVAL!    112

      Our heroes RUN from the warehouse, and behind them... TWO
      MORE CRYSTALISKS. Huge BEASTS in pursuit. But this is
      Borderlands, so you gotta know the Bloodshot Psychos heard
      Tina's big kaboom, and they're running toward our heroes. So
      at least we've got that not going for us.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Looks like zero percent might have
                   been generous!

      Lilith sees: A MINESHAFT off to the side, in the no man's
      land between the Crystalisks behind and the psychos ahead.

                               LILITH
                   THIS WAY!

      They bolt into the entrance to the mine, Psychos closing in
      behind them, followed by Crystalisks. Lilith and Roland turn
      back, shooting, blasting Psychos, who don't seem to be at all
      intimidated by the gunfire. It only angers them more.


113   INT. MINE - DAY                                              113

      Down the tunnel - an ELEVATOR PLATFORM made of CRYSTAL,
      sitting at the bottom of a shaft.

      Elevator cables are broken. Power supply's busted open.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Well, I had fun! Would you like me to
                   sing a song while you're torn limb
                   from limb, to ease the pain of
                   impending death?

      Bloodshots round the corner, along with more Crystallisks.
      Lilith and Roland shoot, but too many coming. Lilith sees
      some liquid death bubbling through cracks in the rock walls.
      She turns to Tina, looking her in the eye.

                               LILITH
                   Tina! Redraw the map.

      Redraw the--? Ohhhhh. You mean? A bunch at once? Now? Aww
      yeah! Tina steps forward. She flips her coat open, pulls a
      shit-ton of tiny bombs out by the harness they're hanging
      from, then SPINS and THROWS...

      She then takes out The Headless Bunny, and pulls the cord in
      its back. She tosses it and covers her hear ears, as do the
      others. The Psychos stop and pick up the bunny, puzzled.
                                                                85.



                         HEADLESS BUNNY
                   (warbly recording)
             Hug me! I'm your friiiiend -

BOOOOOOM! The entire floor of the cavern is ROCKED by a world-
class explosion, setting the entire facility QUAKING. Some
Psychos and Crystalisks are still alive, though, and as they
pick themselves up:

                         CLAPTRAP
             So, we're pretty much back to certain
             death? Yes or yes?

                            LILITH
             Wait for it!

The ground QUAKES AGAIN, and this time... FOOSH! A geyser of
GREEN YELLOW LIQUID DEATH crashes through a crumbling wall,
and only now do we realize Lilith's plan.

                            LILITH
             Hang on.

WHAAA--BOOOOOM!!!! All of the cavern walls begin to fail at
once, and a TIDAL WAVE of LIQUID DEATH pours in, flooding the
massive cavern, killing everything it touches.

                            KRIEG
             BILE FARM!

A Crystallisk runs at them - but is hit with a geyser of
liquid, killing it. The floor below rumbles, but the car
doesn't move. Liquid shoots around the outside of the car.
Tannis looks up sees something in the ceiling.

The liquid pushes up below the elevator car - trying to force
it upwards. The car rattles, trying to move up. Tannis
looks up at the open ceiling, seeing a beam.

                         TANNIS
             THAT BEAM'S BLOCKING US!

Roland and Krieg battle psychos, whose bodies land in the
car, making a little pile. Lilith sees the beam holding them
back, then RUNS UP the psycho pile - LEAPING - grabbing a
ceiling beam! She swings her legs up, her head now upside
down, and kicks at the metal cross beam jamming them!

A geyser BURSTS into the wall, and Krieg grabs an attacking
psycho, PLUGGING THE LEAK WITH HIS HEAD. Liquid runs out of
the psycho's eyes and mouth.
                                                                      86.



      The floor now bubbling, liquid death leaking into the car.
      They dance around it.

                               ROLAND
                   RUNNING OUT OF FLOOR HERE, LIL!

      Tannis rides Claptrap for safety. Tina rides on Krieg's back.
      Lilith kicks, kicks and kicks, finally - MOVES THE BEAM.

      FWHOOSH! THE PLATFORM is PROPELLED UPWARD by the massive
      force of a LIQUID DEATH GEYSER... the crystal protecting our
      heroes, but they're rocketing up at insane speed, and:


114   EXT. PROMONTORY - CONTINUOUS                                  114

      They BLAST up and through a mesh VENTILATION SCREEN at the
      top of the promontory, and get FLUNG into the air...


115   INT. WEDDING CEREMONY - DAY                                   115

      Whiskey barrels everywhere, along with rows set up like pews,
      about twenty Pandoran citizens and their families in an
      intimate ceremony.

      At the alter, SIR ALEISTER HAMMERLOCK, a Pandora version of
      an 19th century British dandy explorer, and WAINWRIGHT
      JAKOBS, a whiskey drinking Southerner, dressed in their
      Sunday best. They stand by a wedding cake under an alter.

      A Justice of the Peace reads from a book, whiskey in hand.

                               JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
                   ...for the most thrilling adventure
                   of all. Love. Do you, Wainwright
                   Jakobs -

                               JAKOBS
                   - Damn right I do, let's get this
                   thing overwith, I want a drink!

      The crowd laughs.

                               JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
                   And do you, Sir Aleister Hammerlock-

      CRASH! Our heroes smash into the tent on the platform,
      crashing right into the cake table.

                               HAMMERLOCK
                   What the dickens?!?
                                                                     87.



      EVEYRONE PULLS GUNS. Lilith, Tina, Roland, Tannis, and
      Claptrap all stand, politely. The whole gathering in total
      shock. Our heroes slooooooooowly exit, stage left.

                               LILITH
                   Congratulations.

                               ROLAND
                   Didn't mean to crash the party.

                               TANNIS
                   Very handsome couple. That one's more
                   handsome. But that just makes the
                   uglier one more lucky.

                               TINY TINA
                         (eating cake)
                   Mmmmm...strawberry. Tasty.

                               KRIEG
                   HAPPY LIFE MEMORIES!

                               CLAPTRAP
                         (tearing up)
                   I...I always cry at weddings. The
                   power of human love...


116   EXT. WEDDING CEREMONY - DAY                                   116

      They step outside, Roland shows Lilith the vault key piece.

                               ROLAND
                   Looks like this is our lucky day.

                               STEELE (O.S.)
                   DROP THE GIRL.

      They look up and see: THE ENTIRE CRIMSON LANCE pulling up,
      guns trained on them. Steele at a turret.

                               TINY TINA
                   How'd General Rancid find us?

                               STEELE
                   Not a lot of fan service trucks
                   delivering garbage to abandoned
                   mines.

                               ROLAND
                         (to Lilith)
                   Scooter. They got him.
                                                               88.



                         STEELE
             Game over Roland. Let's make this
             quick.

                         ROLAND
             It was always a game to you.   These
             people, their lives.

                         STEELE
             I'm thrilled you found your purpose
             on here because now you get to live
             out your days on this shit hole. I
             don't give a rat's ass, so long as we
             have her. You know I don't give last
             warnings, so LET. HER. GO.

Roland glances at Lilith, eyes shooting over to a "Just
Married" VW Bus close by. He slips her the vault key piece.

                         ROLAND
             Sure. I'll let 'er go.

Roland PULLS OUT TWO GUNS, FIRING AT STEELE, RUNNING AT HER.
She dives down into her truck. Chaos. Gunfire. Running.

                         LILITH
             WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

                         ROLAND
                   (to Lilith)
             SAVE TINA!

Lilith grabs Tina, running for the VW. Lance firing at them.

                         JAKOBS
             Now that ain't no way to treat a lady
             and her little girl. Come on!

                         HAMMERLOCK
             NOW IT'S A CEREMONY!

Hammerlock and Jakobs DEFEND LILITH and company as they run
for the VW, firing at the Lance. The wedding guests jump in
on the action, shooting at the Lance, who they all clearly
hate.

Roland, draws fire, with incredible tactical moves, rolling,
shooting, firing. Steele ducking in her tank.

                         JAKOBS
             Hey sunshine!
                                                                       89.



      Lilith turns, Jakobs tosses her the VW keys. She nods thanks
      and gets in the bus, pulling away. Steele sees.

                                STEELE
                   STOP THEM!

      But the wedding guests block, shooting. No way to chase.


117   EXT. VW - JUST MARRIED BUS - DAY                                117

      Lilith and company speed away.     Two RAKS dive bomb the VW.

                                TINY TINA
                   INCOMING!

      Jakobs takes a sip of whiskey and shoots down one of the
      Raks. Hammerlock gives him a little kiss.

                               HAMMERLOCK
                   Bloody good shot!

      The second Rakk DIVE BOMBS LILITH.


118   INT. VW - JUST MARRIED BUS - DAY                                118

                               LILITH
                   TANNIS, DRIVE!

      Tannis grabs the wheel while Lilith SHOOTS THE SECOND RAK,
      WHO LANDS, SPLATTING ON THE WINDSHIELD.

                               TANNIS
                   You really made things worse.

                               LILITH
                   KRIEG, HELP ME!

                               KRIEG
                   VISCERA PAINT PARADE!

      Krieg and Lilith pull the Rak off the windshield while Tannis
      steers, but it's still smeared in blood.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   I can't wait to see how this ends!

      Lilith wipes the guts and sees they're headed FOR A HILL! The
      bus SLIDES DOWN THE HILL, OUT OF CONTROL.
                                                                      90.



119   EXT. WEDDING CEREMONY - DAY                                   119

      NEAR ROLAND, the Lance soldiers have him, but everyone now
      just watches the bus as it careens TOWARDS A CLIFF. The
      fighting has stopped to watch the bus, in horror.


120   INT. VW - JUST MARRIED BUS - DAY                              120

      IN THE VW BUS:     everyone screams.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   WE'RE GONNA DIE! I MEAN, THEY ARE.
                   I'M FREE! I'M FREE!


121   EXT. VW - JUST MARRIED BUS - DAY                              121

      The bus skids OVER THE CLIFF - FALLING TOWARDS THE ROCKS!


122   INT. VW - JUST MARRIED BUS - DAY                              122

      Tannis looks at Lilith, who shrugs.    What can you do...

      Lilith white knuckles, holding the wheel.   Concentrating.

      Tiny Tina screams - and at the last second they ALL PUT THEIR
      HANDS OUT - AND IN A FLASH OF LIGHT, THE BUS DISAPPEARS.


123   EXT. CLIFF - DAY                                              123

      Everyone runs up to watch the bus fall...and disappear in a
      flash. Roland cheers, ecstatic. Steele fumes.

                               ROLAND
                   TINAAAAAAA!!!! That's my girl!!!!
                   Told you she's the -

      Steele ZAPS HIM with a taser, knocking him out.

                               STEELE
                   Prepare him for questioning.

      Two Lance soldiers pick him up. Steele looks below, not
      understanding how they got away. Where are they...

      *NOTE - If we are in budget crisis mode, they can teleport in
      the mine when they are about to crash into the roof. Roland's
      sacrifice would be holding up a wall so they can escape.*
                                                                      91.



124   EXT. WINDSHEAR WASTE - RIGHT NOW                             124

      We’re in a FRIGID SWIRL of frozen air driven by howling wind.
      The landscape is snow and ice, flat and cold as far as the
      eye can see. AURORA PANDORALIS swirls across the sky.

      A solitary BULLYMONG stumbles into frame, its face coated
      with ice... then it keels over and dies, frozen stiff.

      Then, about three feet above the snowy ground... a DOME OF
      PURPLE ENERGY crackles into view... EXPANDS... and then...
      Lilith, Tina, Tannis, Krieg, and Claptrap appear in the bus,
      NOSE FIRST. But still three feet above the-- aaaaand they
      all just fell. The bus falls back onto its wheels, crushing
      them.

      The door opens. Everyone stumbles out of the bus, shocked.

                               TINY TINA
                   I TOLD YOU! I ... AM ... SPECIALLLL!
                   Teleportation whaaaaaat? I MOVE STUFF
                   WITH MY MIND YALLLLL!

      Lilith stumbles out, and, oh god. Nope. Doubles over. Pukes.

                                TANNIS
                   Curious. The teleportation seems to
                   have made her ill. (To Tina) How did
                   you do that?

                               TINY TINA
                   ... Huh. I don't know. It just
                   kinda... happened.
                         (to Lilith)
                   Hey, Roland's gonna be okay, right?

                               LILITH
                         (stumbling up)
                   He's an elite soldier, he'll be okay.
                   Where are we?

                               TANNIS
                   Windshear Waste. We have
                   approximately ten minutes before we
                   expire.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   What do you mean "we," meatbag?

                               KRIEG (O.S.)
                   THE TINY ONE AND THE SAD-FACED MOTHER!
                         (they turn to him)
                   AND THE BLUE TATTOO FOREVER AND EVER!
                                                                      92.



      Then he points back to-- A CAVE ENTRANCE. Shelter!

                               TINY TINA
                   SWEET! Gonna grab me some primo-ass
                   NAPTIME!

      She goes BOUNDING happily toward the cave. Tannis and
      Claptrap follow. Lilith watches Tina go. The girl is special.
      It's all real. The Vault. The Key. The Daughter of Eridea.
      The Treasure Beyond Treasure. Her mother's faith.


125   INT. CAVE - LATER                                           125

      A natural shelter from the storm. Krieg stokes small fire
      with his own hand. Good Lord.

      TINA - snores softly on the ground, where she's basically
      face-planted. Hard to blame her. Busy day.

      TANNIS - in a deeper part of the cave, out of earshot from
      Krieg, has the TWO KEY PIECES. Lilith watches as Tannis fits
      them together. They slide into each other perfectly, joint in
      groove, and snap together with a CLICK. They are now one. A
      single CONICAL SHAPE. Then she just stares at it. Until:

                               LILITH
                   So what happens next?

                               TANNIS
                   Ah. Now you believe... This isn't
                   just a key.

      Tannis holds the key up, so that the firelight shines against
      it, casting shadows on the cave wall. As she turns it, the
      light SHINES through crystals, creating strange shapes on the
      wall. It almost looks like...

                               LILITH
                   Is that... a map?

                               TANNIS
                   It's Pandora. And there.

      Lines of light converge on a single point.

                               TANNIS
                   The location of the one true Vault.
                   It's a shame your mother couldn't be
                   here to see this.

                               LILITH
                   ... where is that?
                                                         93.



                         TANNIS
             Let's see. It appears to be in the
             northwest end of...
                   (squints, then)
             Oh. Yes. Krom's Canyon.

Lilith knew it. Pandora's gonna Pandora.

                         LILITH
             Without Roland we don't stand a
             chance getting through.

                         TANNIS
             We have no choice. It's Krom or
             Atlas. Take your pick.

                         LILITH
             It's suicide. Plus there are three
             parts to the key. We only have two.

                         TANNIS
             No. We have the third part.
                   (glancing at Tina)
             "The Daughter of Eridea will place
             the key and open the Vault, revealing
             a Treasure Beyond Treasure that will
             save us all."

                         LILITH
             If she's the key, what happens...is
             this going to kill her?

Tannis looks at Lilith, puzzled in her odd, blank way.

                         TANNIS
             Of course. She has to die. Did your
             mother never tell you? She was the
             one who found the scroll detailing
             the ritual.

                         LILITH
             I was eight. I can barely remember
             her face.

                         TANNIS
             When the Daughter of Eridea places the
             key, a great energy is summoned forth.
             The pieces are consumed, and the Vault
             opens. There is no salvation without
             sacrifice. I assumed you knew.
                                                                      94.



126   EXT. CAVE - MOMENTS LATER                                     126

      Lilith crouches in the frigid air, trying to absorb what
      she's just heard. Pandora. Miserable Pandora. Where mothers
      are stolen from daughters, and little girls have to die...

      Claptrap moves in gingerly and NUDGES her with his-- WHAP!
      She slaps his dumb claw away.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Whoa! Sorry! I thought for a moment
                   there you had frozen to death. It was
                   a really nice moment. I'll treasure
                   it always!
                         (remembers)
                   Also, I found an old shuttlewreck
                   nearby and scavenged the final parts
                   I needed. It's fixed!

      He hands over-- THE COMMUNICATOR. Good as new. Shivering,
      Lilith slowly reaches out and takes it. Her gears turning.
      Yes. This is the only way. She gets up from the snow, turns,
      and heads into the cave.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Really? No "thank you?" Nothing? Is
                   anyone seeing this?

      But there's no one there. Just the dead BULLYMONG, with one
      frozen-open eye staring blankly at him.


127   INT. CAVE - MOMENTS LATER                                     127

      Lilith marches straight past Krieg, who mutters over his
      fire. Straight past Tannis, who is drawing a map based on the
      key shadows. A glance at Tina, who sleeps. Then she keeps
      going. Deeper into the cave.


128   INT. INNER CAVE - MOMENTS LATER                               128

      The spark of a FLARE. Lilith tosses it in, illuminating a
      dank space. She looks back. Yeah. No one is going to hear her
      in here. She takes the communicator out. A breath... then
      PRESSES THE BUTTON. A moment, then... STATIC, and--

                                  ATLAS (COMMUNICATOR)
                   Lilith?

                               LILITH
                   I have her. She's safe. With me.
                                                                95.



                         ATLAS (COMMUNICATOR)
                   (distorted)
             That took-- less time than-- expected.
                   (static)
             The signal's-- ionization-- we'll have
             to wait until the next cycle to--

                         LILITH
             I know what she is. And I think you
             can hear me just fine.

SHHHHHhshssss. The static disappears. And then:

ATLAS appears in the cave. Right there. Well, a hologram. But
the tech is quite impressive.

                         ATLAS
             Oh no. I've been found out.

                         LILITH
             This communicator was nothing but
             junk the whole time. You chipped me.

                         ATLAS
             Better, I chipped your gun. I knew no
             matter what you'd never leave that.
             You're a "Vladof girl," right?
             Allara? Well. She's been chipped
             since manufacture. But she managed to
             disable it after landing on Pandora.

                            LILITH
             She's smart.

                          ATLAS
             She takes after her "father." After
             the Lance failed to find her, I
             realized I was missing an
             opportunity.

                         LILITH
             Someone who would help her. To find
             the rest of the key. And the Vault.

                         ATLAS
             And you behaved exactly as I predicted.
             "A seeker of the hidden, compelled to
             find that which no one else has."
             Of course, I was hoping you wouldn't
             figure out my ruse until you led me
             to the Vault. But you know where it
             is, don't you.
                   (studying her...)
                         (MORE)
                                                                96.


                         ATLAS (cont'd)
             Yes. You do. You have the keys, and
             you have the location, and soon
             enough, whatever's inside the Vault
             will be mine.

                         LILITH
             If she opens it, she'll die.

                         ATLAS
             She's a tool, Lilith. I grew her in a
             pod for one purpose.

                          LILITH
             Grow another one! You have the keys,
             the location, let her go, I'll take
             her with me.

                         ATLAS
             Clones are expensive and take time
             and I don't throw assets away.

                         LILITH
             I could destroy the key, then you'd
             have nothing.

                         ATLAS
             Then I'd kill her out of spite. Very,
             very slowly. Lilith, you're a
             talented thief, but a terrible
             negotiator.

SWITCH IN POV - someone arriving at the entrance to this
INNER CAVE. Looking in at Lilith and the holographic ATLAS.

                         ATLAS
             I'm coming to collect Allara. And
             because I'm a man of my word, I grant
             you your reward. You are free, Lilith.
             Congratulations.

ON LILITH - staring in impotent shock at Atlas, who then
DISAPPEARS in a shimmer of light. Lilith hangs her head for a
moment, then senses a presence. She turns to see:

TINA - who heard that last bit, and only that last bit. We
can see the betrayal etched on her face. And a dark rage.

                         TINY TINA
             I hope I was worth it.

                         LILITH
             Wait. No, Tina, I was trying to -
                                                                      97.



                               TINY TINA
                   Tell it to my sweet baby.

      Krieg steps out from the shadows and knocks Lilith out with
      his weapon. They look at her for beat, then step out.

                                                          BLACK.


129   EXT. SALT FLATS - MORNING                                      129

      A flat gritty salt bed as far as they eye can see. Until we
      find: an abandoned MOBILE MINING VEHICLE, Crimson Lance logo
      painted on it. This is their fortress. The "Crimson Fastness."


130   INT. CRIMSON FASTNESS - BRIG - CONTINUOUS                      130

      A makeshift brig. Armed Lancers stand at attention around--

      ROLAND - whose armor has been removed. He's CHAINED BY HIS
      ARMS to a steel pipe that runs along the ceiling. Oh, and
      he’s currently GETTING THE SHIT BEAT OUT OF HIM BY TWO LANCE
      SOLDIERS. Rocky in the meat locker.

      Steele steps in. They stop.

                               STEELE
                   Stand down, I'll take it from here.

      The soldiers leave them alone.   When they're gone, she dabs
      his face with a handkerchief.

                               ROLAND
                   Hell of a welcome back. Why didn't
                   you just kill me?

                               STEELE
                   I wanted to see you like this.   And
                   to ask you where they went.

                               ROLAND
                   I saw the same thing as you. That's
                   as far as I know. They could be
                   anywhere on the whole damn planet.

                               STEELE
                   Why would you go AWOL on your family
                   for these... gutter people?

                               ROLAND
                   Gutter people? Come on. You saw what
                   that girl did. Her power.
                                                                     98.



                               STEELE
                   I don't know what I saw, only that
                   they escaped somehow. Some Eridian
                   tech they've been hiding.

                               ROLAND
                   It's her. And these people need her,
                   and we can't let men like Atlas get
                   that power and keep stomping on them.
                   The vault, the keys? Those stories
                   are real, Victoria--

                               STEELE
                   Don’t. You gave up the right to call
                   me that when you quit on me.

                               ROLAND
                   Men like Atlas, they don't care about
                   anything, just more power. There's no
                   end -

                               STEELE
                   CORRECT. The giant corporations win.
                   Always. They have the resources. So
                   do you want to be on the winning
                   side, or one of the losers?

                               ROLAND
                   I know what side I'm on. And I think
                   inside you feel the same.

                               STEELE
                   ENOUGH. You broke the first rule. You
                   got emotionally involved with the
                   target.

                               ROLAND
                   I learned from the best.

      WHAM! Steele puts everything into this punch. She walks out,
      leaving him chained, coughing.


131   EXT. REMAINS OF CAVE - DAY                                    131

      POV - Blurry - from Lilith, on the ground, by a fire. As it
      comes into focus she sees TWO PSYCHOS, bundled up in Skag
      furs, finishing chaining Claptrap to the back of their
      vehicle.
                                                               99.



                         CLAPTRAP
             Fellas, fellas! I live to serve, but,
             let me confirm my friend in there is
             dead and then I can go free! You
             could take her weapons, maybe peel
             her face off for a new mask?

                         PSYCHO
                   (to the other Psycho)
             I dunno. Do you need a new mask?

His friend would answer, but he just got shot in the FACE.
BLAM. Knocked out of frame before we could even see any
gnarly shit that would push us into an R rating.

                            LILITH
             He does now.

LILITH, half-emerged from the rubble, gun aimed at: THE
REMAINING PSYCHO, who raises his-- nope. BOOM. Down he goes.

                         CLAPTRAP
             Hooray! You're alive!

Lilith staggers to her feet. Banged up. Cold. But breathing.

                         CLAPTRAP
             Say, uh, how long were you standing
             there?

Lilith limps over to one of the Psychos. Takes his Skag fur.

                         LILITH
             Lemme guess. You didn't mean it.

                         CLAPTRAP
             What? No, of course I meant it. I
             just wanted to make sure we were
             still on the same page about that.

                         LILITH
             Heartwarming.
                   (looks around)
             Where'd-- ?

                         CLAPTRAP
             They found an abandoned buggy on the
             ridge. I fixed it for them, and had a
             perfectly acceptable way out of here
             but just couldn't bear the thought of
             leaving you when there was a .000025%
             chance you were alive! So-- where to,
             partner?
                                                                     100.



                               LILITH
                   Krom's Canyon.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Great idea! No concern for your own
                   life whatsoever. What I am concerned
                   about is when you're going to unchain
                   me fro-mmmWWHOOOOA!

      Lilith PEELS OUT, dragging the chained CLAPTRAP behind her
      like a string of cans on a wedding limo. As the car speeds
      across the frozen icescape...


132   INT. CRIMSON FASTNESS - BRIG - DAY                           132

      Roland’s still hanging from his chains. Larry facing him,
      holding up some sharp tools.

                               LARRY
                   I used to look up to you, man. Now I
                   have to scrap you for parts. It's
                   nothing personal, but I am the medic.

      Larry and the other Lances laugh. Roland's only got eyes for
      one thing in the room: that KEY RING on the guard’s waist...

                               ROLAND
                   Larry, please - I need water.

                                LARRY
                         (pours out his canteen)
                   Sorry Roly-poly! Fresh out.

                               ROLAND
                   I’ve got gum in my jacket...please.

                                LARRY
                   Oooooh, is that so?
                         (excavating Tina’s gum)
                   Lookie here! We got gum, boys!

      Larry pops a stick, CHEWS OBNOXIOUSLY. Taunting Roland.

                               LARRY
                   Mmmmm-mmmmmm! You guys want some gum?
                   Todd, come get yourself a stick!

      Then he shares Roland’s gum with EVERY GUARD IN THE ROOM.
      They all chew and laugh. Roland just counts silently to
      himself. 18... 19... 20...
                                                                     101.



      BOOM!...... BOOMBOOMBOOM!!! We don’t see it, because that
      would be NC-17 material, but you can guess what happened by
      the BLOOD that just splattered all over Roland and--

      TING! What was that? Ah, the GUARD’S KEYS landing at Roland’s
      feet, his chains broken. Roland smiles. Still got it.

      He unchains himself with his free hand, and then picks up a
      radio from the guard's belt. He tunes in...

                               RADIO
                   ...moving all his forces deeper into
                   Krom's canyon...


133   EXT. KROM'S CANYON - GATE - TIME PASSES - SUN/MOON DUSK       133

      Lilith finally arrives at the gates of Krom's Canyon. Stops
      her vehicle. From behind her--

                               CLAPTRAP (O.S.)
                   Stopping so soon?

      She turns back to see Claptrap... still CHAINED behind her.
      He's been hard-towed this entire time. Deserved it, too.

      Lilith gets out and looks around. Weirdly, not a soul there.
      She unchains Claptrap.

                               LILITH
                   I need you to check Echonet again.
                   Gotta find the exact location of a
                   certain place in here.

                               CLAPTRAP
                         (hopping around)
                   Oh, I'm sorry! I'd jump right on
                   that, but I'm too busy shaking gravel
                   out of my crack!


134   EXT. KROM'S CANYON - GHOST VILLAGE - SUN/MOON DUSK            134

      LOOKING DOWN on Lilith and Claptrap trekking through the
      canyon on foot (and wheel). It's brutally quiet.

      Up ahead... A DEAD VILLAGE - a settlement of derelict homes.
      And there's no sound except Lilith's breathing.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   This must've been one of the original
                   Pandoran settlements. How quaint!
                                                                     102.



      She looks across at a house. Missing door. Broken glass. She
      stops, a little trepidation.

                               LILITH
                   This... was my home.


135   INT. LILITH'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER                            135

      Lilith walks through. Claptrap follows. She hasn't seen this
      place since she was Tina's age. Since her mother was alive.
      And now... it's a ruin. Like her.

      She stops at the entrance to a small room, then enters. Faded
      yellow and blue on the walls. Broken remnants of toys. Near
      the rotting wood of her old bed, there's a TEDDY BEAR. Lilith
      bends down to pick it up. It's a lot like the one Tina was
      carrying around. Odd, how close they are.

      And then something catches Lilith's eyes-- under the bed. She
      pulls it out. It's a SMALL TIN with a crude drawing on it. A
      drawing of a SHAPE. The same shape on Lilith's arm.

      She OPENS the tin. Inside... FOLDED PAPER. DRAWINGS. We saw
      these in Lilith's fuzzy memories when she first landed here.

      Lilith looks at the first one. A 5-year old's self-portrait
      in crayon. "LILITH." Then another one of her and her mother.
      They stand smiling under the Pandoran Sun/Moon.

      Lilith smiles at these forgotten glimpses of a childhood she
      can barely remember... Then she looks at the last drawing,
      and her blood runs cold. We do not see it. Just the shock on
      her face. And the dawning revelation of something enormous.

      In an instant, she understands everything. She knows why her
      mother stayed. She knows why she is the way she is. She knows
      that she has to find Tina as quickly as possible...

      She drops the picture and RUNS out. Claptrap hesitates,
      confused, then follows... As we hear the sound of their
      vehicle roar, we drift down to the edge of the drawing left
      there on the floor. The drawing we still cannot yet see...


136   EXT. KROM’S CANYON - SUN/MOON DUSK                            136

      Back with Tina, Tannis, and Krieg. They move SLOWLY. It's
      deathly quiet here. On either side of them: DIORAMAS OF
      DEATH. Strange SCENES made of dead bodies, all pinned in
      place by spears or chunks of petrified trees. Don't freak
      out. It's more Pirates of the Caribbean scary than Saw scary.
      Let the production designer wow you.
                                                               103.



                         TINY TINA
             This dude is compensatin' for
             something.

                         TANNIS
             ...arches...look for anything with a
             door way, an arch, any flat rock face
             with a key shape... Ignore this junk,
             it's just meant to scare people off.

On cue, more corpses re-animate. Tannis JUMPS.

                         TANNIS
             In all fairness that was legitimately
             terrifying.

PSYCHOS start popping out of nooks and crannies from above
them on the rocks. Salivating over these three juicy steaks
who just waltzed right onto their grill. Krieg notices.

                         KRIEG
             Jackall picnic...

                         TANNIS (CONT’D)
             Perhaps we should consider--

                         TINY TINA
             RUNNING!

Tina heaves a grenade up on the ridge and they HAUL ASS. The
Psychos jump down the rocks, loving the cat and mouse. More
appearing by the second. It’s not looking good until--

                         TINY TINA (CONT’D)
             Roland??? ROLAND!!!

--Tina spots Roland SPEEDING TOWARDS THEM. Piloting a hijacked
CRIMSON LANCE STINGRAY HOVERCRAFT. Swag on one trillion.

                         ROLAND
             DUCK!

                         TINY TINA
             Kriegy! The floor game!

They land heavy on the other side, too heavy, just as --
BOOM! -- Tina’s Christmas presents detonate behind them.

But the victory is short-lived. Roland can’t keep control of
the hovercraft. He jumps off as it crashes. Roland shoots,
but more to help them run for cover.
                                                               104.



                         ROLAND
             Where's Lilith?

                         KRIEG
             A RIVER OF BETRAYAL.

                         TINY TINA
             She called Daddy on me so we ditched
             her. How'd you find us?

                         ROLAND
             Lance on the radio, talking about a
             meeting with Krom, we need to move!

                          TINY TINA
             WHERE TO??   TANNIS, COME ON!

They back away, into a wall. All but Tannis, who stays,
staring at the cliff face. But... from this exact spot...

THE ROCKS FORM the OPTICAL ILLUSION of an ARCH. And in front
of the arch, a short rock with a small CRACK in it just big
enough for a shard to fit. Like a KEY.

                         TANNIS
             A lifetime of searching... Here. IT'S
             HERE! IT'S HEEEEEERE! I feel emotion!

The others join her and see it, mesmerized. But then, A
RUMBLING. Remember those Psychos? Well, they caught up. And
this time they brought the whole family:

THE PSYCHO ARMY - in their vehicles, marching on foot,
sitting on harnessed skags, and led by:

KROM - roided up via experimental Atlas super-solider serum,
Colonel-Kurtz-bald, a Goliath among men. Steering at the helm
of the... oh boy, gear-heads and car nerds, here comes:

THE BADASSASAURUS - a vehicular nightmare made of two huge
tanks Siamese-Twinned together, enormous EXHAUST PIPES
spewing thick smoke behind it, and an articulated TURRET
rising up from the middle... holding a FIRE-BREATHING METAL T-
REX HEAD... because THIS IS PANDORA AND THIS IS ACT THREE AND
EVERYTHING IS ABOUT TO GO TO ELEVEN.

                         TINY TINA
             We go down fighting?

                         TANNIS
             They're not attacking.
                                                            105.



It's true. They've stopped. Assembled, weapons out, ready for
the slaughter, but that's it. Krom sits back...and LAUGHS.

                         ROLAND
             What's he laughing about?

They look up as the FOG CLEARS to reveal... the BIG A in the
sky, and descending rapidly from it... THE ATLAS
WARSHUTTLE... about the size of the dropship he sent Lilith
in. Tina steps back. This is whom she fears the most. Father.

                         TINY TINA
             I really have issues with my dad.

The ship LANDS, and Atlas emerges. Alone. He stands there
between Krom's army and Tina. Then and Krom exchange a
serious nod, then... he beams a smile at Tina, all charm.

                          ATLAS
             I am so proud of you.
                   (off Tina's confusion)
             You survived. You found the Key. You
             found the Vault. You have brought
             your father joy, Allara.

                         TINY TINA
             My name is TINA! And I'm never gonna
             open the Vault for you.

                         ROLAND
                   (raising his rifle)
             You heard the little lady.

                         ATLAS
             You see the army of lunatics behind
             me, yes? I've promised Krom all the
             guns and ammunition he could ever
             want... enough to break the will of
             this entire planet. Or, say, a girl.

Tina pulls out a HAND-ROCKET. Wraps the Key to it with a
strip of torn cloth.

                         TINY TINA
             Any one of these freaks comes near me,
             and your precious Key goes on a sexy
             funtime date with this fine piece of ka-
             bootie.

                         ATLAS
                   (nods, well played)
             All right! No one touches her!
                                                               106.



Tina smiles: Gotcha, "dad."

                         ATLAS
             Her.

He gestures to Krom, who understands immediately. Krom slams
his fist down on a BUTTON at the helm of his Badassasaurus,
and two SPEAR- HEADED CHAINS FIRE OUT of the T-Rex head and
PIERCE KRIEG, who is instantly YANKED OFF HIS FEET as the
chains retract back, dragging him toward the PSYCHOS.

          TINY TINA                          ROLAND
KRIEG!                           KRIEG!                               *

Atlas smiles. Good. It's working. Of course it's working.
KROM slams his fist down on another button, and the T-Rex
head BELCHES FIRE DOWN, singing Krieg in a cloud of HEAT.

                         KRIEG
             NOTHING BUT BLEEDING!

Tina tries to rush to Krieg's side. No fear of the heat. But
Roland restrains her as the mighty Krieg struggles in vain to
free himself from the chains. The Psychos LAUGH at him as
Krom blasts him with another belch of FLAME.

                         KRIEG
             THE PAIN SCREAMS FROM INSIDE!

                         TINY TINA
             STOP IT!

Atlas doesn't even bother looking at her. He just watches the
sport of Krieg's torture. Another BLAST of fire. Krieg is
moving slower. Losing will. He's not burning, he's melting.

                         TINY TINA
             STOPSTOPSTOP, I'LL OPEN IT!

Atlas puts his hand up. Krom stops... The chains release and
Krieg drops. Exhausted, but alive. Our gang in shock.

                         ROLAND
             Tina, think about--

                         TINY TINA
             I'M the special one! And he's my
             friend! So he's special, too!

Roland relents. Stuck between a rock and a hard place. Atlas
grins: Gotcha, "daughter." Tina stares at him, enraged. But
he's beaten her. She puts the rocket away, takes the key in
hand, and walks slowly to the KEYHOLE ROCK.
                                                               107.



ATLAS - watches in greedy anticipation.

TANNIS - watches too. Emotionless as always. Curiosity more
than anything else. The final secret. Roland grits his teeth.

Tina stops in front of the keyhole. Looks at the KEY in her
hand. Back at Atlas. He nods to her. Finish your task. She
raises the KEY high... gives out a mighty YELL... and...

SLAMS THE KEY INTO THE KEYHOLE!

Silence. No sound. Just a huge Psycho army and a Psycho Lord
and Tannis and Roland and Krieg and Atlas and... TINA. Who
opens one eye. Ummm... is it open? Looks at the key in the
hole. Looks at the entrance to the Vault. Nothing happened.

From the ranks of the army, a Psycho starts LAUGHING and
POINTING at the hilarious awkwardness of it all. Atlas,
unamused, gestures to Krom, who gestures to another Psycho,
who immediately SHOOTS the laughing Psycho in the back.

                         ATLAS
             Allara...

Tina is pulling the key out and sticking it back in. Nothing.

                         TINY TINA
             Tina.
                   (keeps trying the key)
             The hell is... ?

Tannis watches Tina. Gears turning. Roland stares, confused.

                         TINY TINA
             Maybe if I twist it like, clockwise?
             Which way is clockwise again? "Echo
             echo echo?"

Atlas rubs his eyes. Headache. Disappointment.

                         ROLAND
             I saw you... You're the Daughter of
             Eridea...

                         ATLAS
             Apparently not.

                         TINY TINA
             What? Maybe it needs a password!
                                                             108.



                             ATLAS
                There was always a chance my petri
                dish "Eridean" wouldn't have a pure
                enough bloodline. I'll have to start
                over and make a new Allara, building
                on what I've learned.
                       (to Krom)
                I'll need her intact nervous system
                to do a proper genetic analysis for
                the next regeneration.
                      (off Krom's confusion)
                ... Pull her head and spine from her
                body and put it on my ship.

                            TINY TINA
                Whoa whoa, okay, hey you know what?
                You can call me Allara if you want.

But he's already walking to his ship. Calls back to Krom.

                            ATLAS
                And don't forget the key.

Krom nods to his men. Three Psycho brutes start walking
toward a terrified Tina. Roland steps up, ready for the
worst. And then:

                            LILITH (O.S.)
                STOP.

Everyone LOOKS UP. LILITH stands at the top of the CANYON. A
lone hero set against the sun/moon. The Queen of Awesomeness.

KROM turns his helmeted face at Lilith, the way he did all
those years ago...

Lilith SLIDES DOWN the banked cliffside, landing on the
ground like a cat. Then rises up. Eyes on Atlas.

                            LILITH
                You're not going to kill her.

She starts walking to Tina. And as she does, she drops her
gun to the ground. Then her other gun. Then her ammo belt.
Until she's completely disarmed. What is she doing?

                            LILITH
                We're going to make a deal.

Atlas laughs.
                                                                    109.



                               ATLAS
                   The great negotiator returns!
                         (smile fades)
                   Our deal is concluded. You're alive.

                               LILITH
                   I know... Now you're going to let her
                   live.

      She stands next to Tina.

                               ATLAS
                   And why would I ever do that?

                               LILITH
                   Because I'm going to open the Vault...
                   I'm the Daughter of Eridea.

      Lilith reaches out and takes the KEY from Tina. The first
      time she's held the assembled key... and she holds it high.
      Behold. THE GROOVES IN THE KEY begin to GLOW. Like purple
      fire in the stone. Lilith exhales. She wasn't sure that would
      work. But it did.


137   INT. LILITH'S HOME - DAY                                      137

      FLASH TO - the DRAWING on the floor of Lilith's home. A
      little stick figure girl drawn in crayon... making PURPLE
      SWIRLS in the air... domes of energy...


138   EXT. KROM'S CANYON - DAY                                      138

      BACK TO SCENE - Lilith looks down at her forearm. The mark...
      is GLOWING.

                               ROLAND
                   That was you...

      Tina stares in shock. But... she's the special one... Atlas
      takes a step forward. Eyes lit up in desire. Yes. YES.

                                 LILITH
                   Stop.
                         (and he does)
                   She lives. Give me your word.

                               ATLAS
                   You have it. And I have nothing to
                   gain by breaking it. Open the Vault,
                   and she lives. NOBODY HURTS THE GIRL.
                                                                     110.



      Krom nods. Lilith looks to Atlas, nods okay. She turns to
      the KEYHOLE... but TINA gets in between her and the rock.

                               TINY TINA
                   But I'm the special one. Me. I'm
                   special! I teleported us!

                               LILITH
                   No... I did that.


139   INT. VW - JUST MARRIED BUS - DAY                              139

      FLASH OF HER MEMORY - the bus falls - Tina screams, and next
      to her... Lilith is screaming NO in a rage... the rage of a
      mother protecting a daughter...


140   EXT. KROM'S CANYON - DAY                                      140

      BACK TO SCENE - It was Lilith? It was Lilith all along?

                               TINY TINA
                   Why did you let me think it was me?

                               LILITH
                   I didn't know I did it. I was just a
                   little girl...I forgot who I was...

      ON ATLAS - he steps forward, growing impatient, clapping
      twice, but Krieg looks at him and growls... as if to say,
      "C'mon man, give them a moment."

      Lilith looks to Roland. Finally understanding.

                               LILITH
                   I did it because I had someone to
                   believe in. Because to me, you're the
                   most special girl in the galaxy.

      Tina smiles. Lilith tries too, but it's hard to keep up the
      facade. Tina's smile fades in response. Something's wrong.

                               LILITH
                   My mother sent me away to protect me.
                   Because whoever opens the vault...

      It takes Tina a moment. And then she does. No... She looks to
      Tannis, who nods. It's true. And Tina's little heart breaks.
      She had Lilith for a moment, and now she's leaving. Forever.

                               TINY TINA
                   But... you can't...
                                                              111.



                          LILITH
              It's okay. I'm ready.

                          ATLAS
              So am I. Now, if you please.

Lilith stands up. Roland comes over to take Tina's hand... to
keep her back and let Lilith do what she has to do.

Lilith walks toward the KEYHOLE. Looks back to her friends.

                          LILITH
              Keep her safe.

They nod. There's a tear in Krieg's eye.

                           LILITH
              Hey. Don't bury me.
                    (smiles through tears)
              Redraw the map. Way more heroic.

Tina nods, taking that quite seriously, even as the tears
trickle down her cheeks. And that's it. Nothing more to be
said. Lilith walks to the KEYHOLE.

Lilith lifts the KEY, raises it high...

                          LILITH
                    (to herself)
              I wish you were here to see it.

Then... she SLAMS THE KEY DOWN into the HOLE, and...

THE SPACE WITHIN THE ARCH – EXPLODES IN A PURPLE LIGHT. It
PENETRATES through Lilith’s BODY...

The purple glow nearly blinds everyone. Lilith SCREAMS in
AGONY... the energy literally LIFTING HER OFF THE GROUND...
FLOWING THROUGH HER, pouring from her eyes, her mouth...

INSIDE THE GATE – ANOTHER DIMENSION APPEARS! THE VAULT!

...a final terrible SCREAM from LILITH... THE ENERGY
DISSIPATES... and Lilith’s body FALLS TO THE GROUND. Eyes
open. No focus. The mark on her arm glows no more.

She's dead.

Atlas strides forward into the OPEN VAULT... some kind of
extra-dimensional space that has been revealed. An echoing,
otherwordly chamber of SWIRLING LIGHT AND ENERGY. It's
beautiful...
                                                                     112.



      Behind him, Tina rushes over to Lilith's dead body. Tries to
      revive her. But it's pointless. Dead is dead, and she's
      really dead. Seriously. Stop thinking she isn't. She is.
      Claptrap wheels over. Looks down at Lilith's body.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Hoora--!!!!
                         (Tina glares)
                   --ndous! Suuuuper horrendous. Anyway,
                   nice knowing you. I'm off to do what
                   ever I damn well please! Byeeee!

      As he starts rolling away...


141   INT. VAULT - DAY                                              141

      IN THE VAULT - Atlas enters. In the middle of the room, there
      is a small CHEST. No lock. Yes. At last... all of the years,
      all of the money, all of the lives burned... for this.

      Behind him, Tannis and Krieg crane their necks to see. Behind
      THEM... Krom and his army keep their weapons aimed at our
      heroes. No chance for last minute heroics. Atlas puts his
      hands on the chest... flips the lid open and... INSIDE IS....

      Nothing. Nothing at all.

      What the fuck? He runs his hands in and out of the space. No.
      It can't be. Nothing? NOTHING? After all this?

                               ATLAS
                   No. This is a trick. The Vault is
                   under this. Or through this. DID YOU
                   THINK THIS WOULD STOP ME?!?!

      The Psychos look at each other. They may be crazy, but this
      dude is nuuuuuuts....

                               ATLAS
                   I found your Vault! I opened it! If
                   you buried treasure here, I will dig
                   it up. I will dig down to the core! I
                   WILL ENSLAVE EVERY LAST MAN, WOMAN
                   AND CHILD ON PANDORA IF I HAVE TO! I
                   WILL CRACK THIS PLANET IN TWO!

      Tina stares in shock and horror at what Atlas is saying.
      Everyone on Pandora is in terrible danger.

      That's probably why she doesn't notice: THE MARK ON LILITH’S
      ARM ... begins to GLOW. A faint purple...
                                                                     113.



      then more intense... ...and then the MARK GROWS, crawling up
      Lilith’s arm in SWIRLS AND LOOPS...

      And now Tina sees it. She backs away from Lilith. What’s
      happening? The swirling tattoo-like marks glow brighter and
      brighter... turning from PURPLE to ORANGE.

                               ATLAS
                   THE TREASURE... WILL... BE....

      And that's as far as he gets with that, because there's a
      SHADOW moving on the wall... some light source coming from--?

      LILITH - the swirls on her skin glowing orange...

      TANNIS - steps forward... yes... of course. How could she have
      missed it all along?

      Lilith's EYES SNAP OPEN, and they are FIRE. Orange flame. Tina
      scrambles back to Krieg, terrified. Roland watches, awestruck.
      Atlas' jaw hangs. The Psychos stare in shock.

      Lilith RISES to her feet. No, not Lilith. I told you she was
      dead, and she is. This isn't Lilith anymore.

      She is... FIREHAWK. We're still going to call her Lilith,
      because we can. But like the drawing, SHE. IS. FIREHAWK.

      Lilith fists clench... she straightens... and WINGS OF FIRE
      sprout from her back as she assumes her ultimate form.

                               TINY TINA
                   What's happening?

                               TANNIS
                   This is what the Erideans left
                   inside. A gift of salvation for the
                   people of Pandora... They delivered
                   us a champion.

      The power inside the Vault has been set free, transforming the
      once Daughter of Eridea into an avenging ANGEL.

                               ROLAND
                   Treasure beyond treasure.


142   INT. CAVE OPENING - DAY                                       142

      IN THE CAVE with the blind girl - her picture GLOWS.   Her
      eyes can SEE again. Her smile growing, in total awe.
                                                                     114.



143   EXT. GARBAGE PILE - DAY                                       143

      IN THE GARBAGE OF PANDORA - The kids feel the ground rumble,
      light glowing in the sky. They watch, stunned. She's HERE.


144   EXT. KROM'S CANYON - FINAL BATTLE - DAY                       144

      AT THE VAULT ENTRANCE

      Lilith rises into the air with beats of her flaming wings,
      and turns her burning gaze onto... ATLAS. Who is smart enough
      to know this is about to get very, very, kinda sorta bad.

                               ATLAS
                   KILL HER!!!!!!!

      That's all Krom need to hear. He slams his fist down on a
      button, and the BADASSASAURUS LURCHES FORWARD, spitting FIRE,
      and the PSYCHO ARMY CHARGES... FIRING EVERYTHING AT LILITH
      AND TINA AND TANNIS AND ROLAND AND KRIEG, AND:

      LILITH spins to face them, and instantly creates an ORANGE
      ENERGY DOME around her and her friends... stopping the
      bullets dead. The Psychos stop firing. It's Lilith's turn.

      And NOW the BATTLE FOR PANDORA begins.

      Rather than spell it all out beat by beat, let me give you
      the high points. Lilith can:

      PHASEWALK – instantaneous movement through another dimension,
      allowing her to traverse distances in the blink of an eye, or
      teleport someone else at will.

      Which means she's BEHIND the enemy, attacking them from the
      rear, and when they TURN to face her, she's not there... and
      now she's FLANKING THEM... and when they fire at her friends,
      she's instantly moving them through space as well...

      PHASELOCK – lock a Psycho in a bubble of energy, trapping
      them helplessly in mid-air... and then SLAM them down into
      their fellow Psychos, which is particularly fun when one of
      them is wearing something explosive like a flamethrower
      backpack or a cooking grenade...

      But when you're facing an army of a THOUSAND PSYCHOS, you
      need what we nerds like to call an "area of effect" attack.
      You know. Something that covers some space. Like:

      PHASESTRIKE – a concussive ENERGY BLAST that blows enemies
      backwards, smashing their bones and rendering them gooey.
                                                               115.



THE PROTECTIVE ENERGY DOME - It’s keeping most of the horde
out, but the truly insane are muscling through in ones and
twos.

Roland switches from one target to the next. His rifle
spitting lead. Krieg takes out a WHOLE BUNCH OF RAGE on the
Psychos who left him for dead. That big ol' sawbladefootclub
of his is connecting with a LOT of skulls. Tina tosses
grenades like party favors. Even Tannis pops a few caps in a
few asses. Claptrap does impressive karate chops. Who knew?

                         KRIEG
                   (thwack)
             NOBODY STOPS THE BLOOD TRAIN!!!!

WITH LILITH - in the middle of the chaos, when she hears...

                         TINY TINA
             LILITH!

She turns quickly to Tina... eyes flaming with concern. But
Tina is not in trouble. What she IS is TINY TINA, THE WORLD'S
DEADLIEST 13 YEAR-OLD, and she's got a whole mess of SWEET
BABIES that need delivering to a bunch of Psychos...

                         TINY TINA (CONT’D)
             Wanna play catch?!

Oh yeaaaaaah. Fire-eyed Lilith, goddess of flame and
retribution, SMILES. That's a sweet idea. Tina heaves baby
after baby into the air like rice at a wedding. Lilith force-
catching each, flinging them into the horde.

                         TINY TINA (CONT’D)
             YOU get an internal injury! And YOU
             get an internal injury! And YOU--

The bombs make for a great light show. And a ton of severed
limbs. But there’s a looooot of Psychos out here. And they’re
weighing hard on Lilith’s protective forcefield. She
phasewalks back inside, beside Roland. The light flickers on
the force field. Lilith losing strength. More psychos come.

                         ROLAND
             We can't hold them much longer!

Even with Lilith’s new awe-inspiring power, she can’t attack
and play defense at the same time. This is about to be
Hollywood’s shortest climax, if not for:

THE CRIMSON LANCE - arriving in force, the very militia that
used to serve Atlas, now turned against him!
                                                                     116.



      They cut down Psychos by the dozen from atop their Stingrays
      and Outrunners. And at the front of the pack... STEELE.

                               STEELE
                   Listen up soldiers, little change of
                   pace. Today, THE LANCE DEFENDS
                   PANDORA.

      BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM and they FIRE AT KROM'S PSYCHOS.

      WITH ROLAND - as he realizes what just happened. A grin.
      Then, with renewed vigor, he turns back to the fight.

                               KRIEG
                   MURDER ENSEMBLE!!

      WITH ATLAS - seeing the tide begin to turn. What are they
      doing???? He scowls, stalks up the ramp of his ship, already
      calculating the net fiscal losses from this misadventure.

                               LILITH
                   Going somewhere?

      Lilith suddenly blinks in front of him, blocking his path.
      Before he can get a word in -- WOOMP! -- Lilith hits him with
      a CONCUSSIVE BLAST, sending him skidding into the dirt.

      Atlas has never felt pain like this before. Been a while
      since anyone’s dared lay a finger on him. He wipes the blood
      from his nose, shocked. Then... pissed. He stands. Dusts his
      million dollar jacket.

                               ATLAS
                   Do you know who I am?! I own this
                   galaxy! And you--

      WOOMP! This one knocks him right to the vault. But now when
      he looks up, there’s fear in his eyes. He backpedals on his
      ass away from Lilith, into the vault.


145   EXT. KROM’S CANYON - DAY                                    145

      In the thick of it. The gang’s still fighting.   Claptrap
      karate chops Psychos like a Cuisinart.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Interplanetary ninja assassin
                   Claptrap activated!

      ROLAND - has found his way to Steele, mid-fight.
                                                                     117.



                               ROLAND
                   Forgot how good you looked shooting a
                   repeater!

                               STEELE
                   Happy to be here, but don't consider
                   this a date. Not yet. LOOKOUT!

      They shoot psychos, fighting back to back, like old times.

      Tannis sketches a quick calculation, not shooting anyone.

                               TINY TINA
                   You gonna kill them with math?

                               TANNIS
                   Actually, yes.

      She fires at a rock that causes a LANDSLIDE, CRUSHING A GANG
      OF PSYCHOS.

                                TINY TINA
                   AWESOME!   I WANNA TRY MATH!

                               TANNIS
                   Oh it's easy, you simply calculate
                   the mass times gravity-


146   INT. THE VAULT - DAY                                         146

      Lilith looms over Atlas. He’s reached stage 3: BARGAINING.

                               ATLAS
                   Okay, okay! You win! What do you
                   want? Money? A planet?   Oh come
                   ooooon! It was just business!

                               LILITH
                   "Rip her head from her spine."

                               ATLAS
                   You like the kid? I’ll clone you ten
                   of them! Free of charge!

      That makes her smirk. Her fist glows a brilliant orange as
      she powers up. Tired of his shit.

                               LILITH
                   You know, Atlas, for such a wealthy
                   businessman, you're a terrible
                   negotiator.
                                                                   118.



      As she WINDS UP FOR THE FINISHING BLOW-- she senses something
      behind her-- DUCKS JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME-- as a CHAINSAW
      MACE (figure it out) flies right over her head.

      She turns. Because now she's standing face to face with KROM.

                               ATLAS
                   What the hell took you so long?!

      Lilith doesn’t wait for the bell. She blinks behind Krom in
      an instant, but with a little glitching. But Krom BLOCKS THAT
      SHIT. Inhumanly fast. Lilith's energy dropping.


147   EXT. KROM’S CANYON - DAY                                     147

      Back outside, Roland and the Crimson Lance mop up the rest of
      the Psychos as the last one flee. Claptrap throws a toilet.

                               CLAPTRAP
                   Aaaaaaand stay out!

                               TINY TINA
                         (looking around)
                   Where’s Lilith?


148   INT. THE VAULT - DAY                                         148

      In the vault, it’s a different story. Krom doesn’t have
      statues all over Pandora for nothing. One big swing of his
      chainsaw mace sends Lilith to the ground.

                               ATLAS
                   Yes! Haha! Yesss! That’s why I pay
                   you the big bucks!

      As Krom towers over Lilith, ready to lay the hammer -- BOOM! --
      an explosion against his back makes him stumble. Tina’s in the
      vault. Terrified but standing her ground.

                               TINY TINA
                   Get away from her you bully!!

      She chucks another grenade, but he SWATS IT LIKE A FLY. Three
      huge steps and he’s there, slapping her to the ground. Yeesh.

                                 LILITH
                   No...

                               ATLAS
                   Remember, I need the head and the
                   spine.
                                                               119.



Krom cracks his neck. Gets ready for surgery. Tina looks to
Lilith, not as a precocious bad-ass... but as a little girl.

                            LILITH
                Tina... need a light.

Tina lights a lighter. Krom laughs, holding his
flamethrower. Then... FLAMES flicker around Lilith's skin...
her tattoos growing WHITE HOT - as she absorbs the elements
from Tina's lighter... and as Krom goes for the kill...

KROM HEATS UP.   He takes off his helmet. He's YOUNG, and
really, really out of shape. Atlas is shocked. Lilith doesn't
care. She just keeps cooking him. His suit almost melting.

                            KROM
                Whoa, top, stop, stop, I'M NOT EVEN
                THE ORIGINAL KROM! I NEVER KILLED
                YOUR MOTHER, I WASN'T EVEN BORN YET!
                I KILLED THE OTHER GUY AND TOOK HIS
                SUIT, I COPIED THE VOICE, NOBODY
                CARED -

HE EXPLODES..

Flames emanate from Lilith like some divine aura. She just
went THROUGH Krom... Then her attention falls on Atlas...

                            ATLAS (CONT’D)
                Oh God. No! DON'T MELT ME! PLEASE!

But Lilith just powers down. Tattoos still glowing, she picks
Tina up. And Tina hugs her neck like the kid she is.

                            LILITH
                Ready to get outta here?

Tina nods. Then, hand in hand, they head for the exit.

                            ATLAS
                So... that’s it? We good?

As Lilith crosses the threshold that leads back to Pandora,
she finally turns around. Smiles sardonically.

                            LILITH
                Today’s your lucky day, Atlas ...at
                last.

And with that, she TAKES THE KEY FROM THE VAULT DOOR...

                             ATLAS
                NO, WAIT--
                                                                     120.



      ... and CLOSES THE VAULT. Trapping Atlas inside.


149   EXT. KROM’S CANYON - DAY                                      149

      Lilith turns to Tina, smiles. Then crushes the key in her
      hand. The gang approaches. Lilith clocks Steele’s presence.

                               LILITH
                         (to Roland)
                   I see you two kissed and made up.

                               ROLAND
                   More like kicked each other’s ass and
                   made up, but yeah.

                               STEELE
                   He grows on ya. Hey, sorry I tried to
                   kill you. Company business.

                               TINY TINA
                   Oh, I never take that stuff
                   personally. We're good.

      Tannis examines her glowing tattoos--

                                  LILITH
                   Do you mind?

      There's a whirring sound, and then:

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                   Lilith.

      Lilith's blood chills. She knows that voice. She turns slowly
      and sees:

      CLAPTRAP - in a strange rigid pose. An image is being
      projected out of his eye. A woman's face. She’s bloody.
      Dying, actually.

                                  LILITH
                   Mama?

                               LILITH’S MOTHER
                   Lilith... if you’re hearing this... I
                   didn’t make it.


150   EXT. PANDORA - SOME TIME AGO - DAY                            150

      Lilith’s Mother, in an alley, on her last legs. Krom’s blast
      didn’t kill her. At least not right away.
                                                                     121.



      Psychos run rampant in the distance. She finds a spot near a
      trash heap. Good a place as any to die.

                               LILITH’S MOTHER (V.O.)
                   That means it’s up to you, lily pad.
                   I know it’s not fair, but now the
                   vault is your destiny.

      As her eyes grow heavy, they fall on something in the trash
      heap... An old Hyperion CL4P-TP robot.

      LATER - Lilith’s Mother has wrested its BACK PANEL open.
      Using the last of her strength to re-jigger its wires. Now we
      notice she has the SAME TATTOO as Lilith.

                               LILITH’S MOTHER (V.O.)
                   Someday, this place will call you
                   back. This world can be beautiful
                   again. You’re gonna make it so.

      Then... we see CLAPTRAP’S LIGHT FLICKER ON...


151   EXT. KROM’S CANYON - BACK TO SCENE - DAY                      151

      Lilith, looking at the hologram of her mother’s face. So
      close she could touch her. If only. Her eyes water...

                               LILITH’S MOTHER
                   I’m just sorry I couldn’t be here to
                   see it.

                                LILITH
                   So am I...

                               LILITH’S MOTHER
                   When the time comes for you to
                   return, you won’t be alone. I
                   programmed this unit to help with
                   whatever you need... My treasure
                   beyond treasure.

      Tina joins Lilith and takes her hand.

                               LILITH’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
                   I love you, Lilith...

                               LILITH
                   I love you too, Mama. I'm sorry I
                   doubted. I'm sorry. I'm--

      The image DISAPPEARS. And Claptrap regains whatever his
      version of consciousness is.
                                                            122.



                         CLAPTRAP
             Whoa. That was weird. How could I
             have forgotten about that? It seems
             SO IMPORTANT. Would’ve been useful in
             the beginning, amirite?

Lilith hangs her head. Unbelievable.

                         LILITH
             Yeah. Great. Look, you did your job.
             And technically, I died.

                         CLAPTRAP
             Correct!

                         LILITH
             What I'm saying is-- you're free to
             go.

                         CLAPTRAP
             Yes! I agree.
                   (looks around)
             The thing is... well, you're less
             terrible than everyone else on this
             planet. I no longer wish death upon
             you. And what higher praise can I
             give than that?

                         LILITH
             A lot. A lot higher praise.

                         CLAPTRAP
             And we'll work up to it! As a team!

                         ROLAND
             He's right. We've won this battle,
             but there are still Psychos out
             there. And Skags and Rakk Hives. The
             work isn't over.

CLOSE ON LILITH, listening to:

                         MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
             No. But the Vault contained hope.
             Hope in the form of a flaming goddess
             who will lead us in the fight to save
             the good people of Pandora.

She nods. Yes. That is what she is. Hope. And... Wait. I'm
sorry, who the fuck was saying that? Lilith turns and sees...
KRIEG. And then, in Lilith's head, she hears:
                                                              123.



                         KRIEG (IN HER HEAD)
             She... hears me? The real me?

                           LILITH
             I do.

Krieg drops his club. Falls to his knees. Overwhelmed. And
yells to the sky:

                         KRIEG
             NIPPLE SALAD!

Everyone looks at each other. What was that?

                            KRIEG (IN HER HEAD)
                      (heavy sigh)
             Sorry.

They sit, Tina, in between Lilith and Roland, Krieg on one
side, Steele the other.   Claptrap wheels over, and Krieg
pets him like a dog. Even Tannis comes by, pouring a cup of
tea for Tina. No idea where the fuck that came from.   And
Tina looks around...at her family. A tear in her eye.

Then... A HONK.

A brand new BANDIT TECHNICAL rolls up with MOXXI, SCOOTER and
ELLIE behind the wheel. And with them, MARCUS in his bus.

Ellie, Moxxi and Scooter hop out of the Bandit Technical.

                         SCOOTER
             Well dip my ass in honey and wipe me
             with fire ants, I missed a battle,
             didn't I?

                         ROLAND
             Perfect timing, right as it ended.

                         ELLIE
             Reckoned anyone alive might wanna
             catch a ride...

             Ain't that my line?

                         MOXXI
             Must've been some fight. Were you on
             fire?

                           LILITH
             Yup.

             ............ Okay.

                         MARCUS
             I hear some Psychos are attacking a
             settlement in the Rust Commons. They
             could use a few vault hunters - I
             mean, finders - like yourselves!

                         LILITH
             I'm not a... I guess I am.

                         MARCUS
             Hey, you lost your Vladof! Fear not,
             I've got an extra Maliwan. Try it!

Marcus reaches in his bag, and tosses her a Maliwan. She
spins it around an holsters it.

                         LILITH
             Thanks, guess I'm a Maliwan girl now.
             You go on ahead. We'll catch up.

Lilith smiles at Tina. Ready? Yeah. She's ready. Lilith takes
her by the hand, and FIREHAWK AND TINY TINA phaseshift through
time and space... a glorious streak of FIRE across the sky...
and my friends, I'm so sorry to say it, but this is:

                                                THE END.
