                                 ACT ONE

    OVER BLACK

                           VIVI (V.O.)
                 What would we do without our
                 girlfriends?

1   EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT                                             1

    The BLACKNESS shimmers and moves. We realize it's a DARK SEA.

                           VIVI (V.O.)
                 Of course, we sometimes disagree.

    WE GO UNDER the waves. The WATER undulates. A CHURNING ocean.

                           VIVI (V.O.)
                 We envy each other, we hide things
                 from each other.

    A DEAD BODY crashes through the water. Slowly sinking.

                           VIVI (V.O.)
                 But when it comes down to it, we'll
                 do anything for each other...

    A GLINT of something in the dark. REVEAL, tangled in the
    body's sweater: a gold BRACELET. CLOSE ON the bracelet,
    inscribed with: “Choose Happiness.” The BODY SINKS below
    camera, leaving a TRAIL of BLOOD.

                             VIVI (V.O.)
                 Anything.

                                                SMASH TO TITLES:

    SNAPPY POP MUSIC COMES UP as we FADE UP ON A LIGHTER WORLD:

    BARN. A white van out front, on the side: “Lindsay Leighton
    Interiors and Landscape Design.” FLY INSIDE --

    It's dressed for a chic party: cocktail tables, flowers,
    hanging lanterns. LINDSAY CRAWFORD LEIGHTON, white, early
    40's, primps the party as she talks on her cell --

                        LINDSAY
              No, it has to be a Juliet rose.
              Because. People hire me for
              perfect. That's my brand.

    As she hangs up, we don't doubt it. She’s used to being in
    control and it shows: her dress, her hair, the décor: all
    flawless. Except... that crooked lantern up in the rafters.
    Damn. OFF Lindsay, eyeing a ladder--

                        VIVI (PRELAP)
              Are you crazy?

4   INT. VIVI AND RORY'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAY (D1)             4

    An idyllic cottage, perfect for a young couple in love.
    VIVIAN VASQUEZ, AKA “VIVI,” our survivor, 30's, Latina, cute
    pixie haircut, does her makeup at her vanity. Her boyfriend,
    RORY CRAWFORD, 30's, white, dashing and preppy, sits behind
    her, kissing her neck. Vivi smiles, brushing him away.

                        VIVI
              We can’t be late for dinner. Your
              sister will kill us.

    Rory ignores her, tries to slip her bra strap from her
    shoulder...but she INSTANTLY CLAMPS her hand down on his. NO.
    STOP. They eye each other in the mirror. Rory knows what this
    is about. He’s tender with her.

                        RORY
              Babe, I know your body’s changed.
              And I still think you’re the
              sexiest woman in the entire world.

    She looks at him, grateful. His words help. She turns to kiss
    him. He kisses back. As thing get heated, we PULL OUT from
    their window, landing in --

5   EXT. NYC - STREET / OFFICE BUILDING - DAY (D1)                5

    -- the bustling world of NYC, where we COME DOWN on our
    firecracker, ANA NZINGA HUGHES, 30's, African American/mixed
    race, bold and chic, bursting out of an office building,
    striding toward a waiting town car --

                 Woke, my ass!

    Close behind her is JAMIE LIM, 30's, Asian, business suit,
    friendly frat boy vibe.

                           JAMIE
                 Dude, chill. What exactly did they
                 say?

                           ANA
                 I didn’t get the promotion. But
                 they would love to have me serve on
                 the diversity council.

                           JAMIE
                 What? Why didn’t you get it?

                           ANA
                 Didn’t put in enough face time at
                 the office, my trades were too
                 risky... Please. If you want to
                 accomplish anything in this world,
                 you have to take risks!

    Taking us BACK TO--

6   INT. LINDSAY'S BARN - DAY (D1)                               6

    Risky Lindsay, on the ladder, fixing the lantern. Suddenly
    the rope holding it slips and the lantern FALLS. She screams--
    but, a foot from her head, it STOPS. She looks down to find
    her savior: ridiculously hot NICK WOLFSON, 30's, sexy
    stubble, holding the rope -- and looking right up her skirt.

                            LINDSAY
                 Nick? Oh my god. Thank you.
                     (then)
                 What are you doing here?

                           NICK
                 Just dropped by to save your life.

    She stares down at him as he looks up at her. Damn, he is
    cute -- and charming. They clearly have a vibe.

                           NICK (CONT’D)
                 And to pick up the blueprints for
                 the Jackson project. Putting the
                 doors in tomorrow.

    Nick starts climbing the ladder. Lindsay reacts, she’s used
    to calling the shots --

                           LINDSAY
                 What is happening right now?

    But now he’s right behind her, hoisting the lantern --

                           NICK
                 I got this, gorgeous.

    As he leans in close to her, she can feel him pressing into
    her ass. CLOSE ON a scandalized Lindsay, this is highly
    inappropriate. At the same time, this may be the sexiest
    thing that’s ever happened to her. Especially when Nick puts
    his hand on Lindsay’s hip and murmurs into her ear--

                           NICK (CONT’D)
                 So, why the sexy dress ten feet in
                 the air? Not complaining. I enjoyed
                 the view.

    Lindsay can barely speak --

                           LINDSAY
                 I’m... hosting a surprise party for
                 one of my best friends in an hour.
                     (always polite)
                 You’re... welcome to drop by for a
                 glass of wine, of course.

                           NICK
                 What are you doing after?

                           LINDSAY
                     (breathless)
                 Um, not sure.

    He whispers in her ear, his body pressed against hers --

                           NICK
                 Come on, meet me tonight. After
                 your thing.

    She would like nothing more... but the reality is --

                           LINDSAY
                 Nick, I’m married. I can’t.

                           NICK
                 Too bad. Because there is a lot I
                 would love to do to you.

    Lindsay’s mouth drops open as Nick climbs down. Off Lindsay,
    fanning herself, GO TO--

7   INT. VIVI AND RORY'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAY (D1)             7

    Two people who've just finished going at it: Vivi and Rory.
    She brings the sheet up high to cover her chest.

                        RORY
              That was hot.

    He looks at her sexily. But she’s insecure about her body--

                        VIVI
              Was it?

                        RORY
              Yes. Unless it wasn’t good for you?
              It... seemed like it was.

                        VIVI
              No, it was. Sometimes, you know,
              the lack of estrogen is an issue,
              but this time, it was fine.

    Not the most enthusiastic review.

                        RORY
              Okay... Good.

    He’s relieved. But also, unsure. We can see how much he wants
    to be there for her, to make sure she’s feeling okay about
    everything -- but underneath that? It’s emotionally
    exhausting. She clocks it.

                        VIVI
              Something wrong, babe?

                        RORY
              No. I’m just...excited for the day
              when this is all in the rear view
              mirror.

    Cancer has been hard on him, too. She knows that.

                        VIVI
              Me too.

    They look at each other -- they’ve been through a lot and
    their look is full of love -- and kiss. Her phone rings, she
    looks at the caller I.D.

                  Speaking of. It’s Dr. Beth.

     She gets up to take the call in another room as he waits--

8    INT. VIVI AND RORY'S COTTAGE - LIVING ROOM - DAY (D1)            8

     Vivi’s on the phone with Dr. Beth, whom we don’t see.

                            VIVI (INTO PHONE)
                  Not gonna lie, Dr. Beth. I have a
                  little scanxiety. You said you
                  flagged something last time? How
                  does it look?

     She smiles nervously. But as she listens, her smile fades.

                            VIVI (CONT’D)
                  No. No, that can’t be right.
                  That’s not-- How does that even--?

     Vivi throws the phone on the couch. We hear from the phone:

                            DR. BETH (V.O. THRU PHONE)
                  Vivi? Are you there?

     But Vivi just looks at the phone like it’s a snake.

     Rory’s clearly been waiting for the news as Vivi enters.

                  What did she say?

     Vivi wavers -- then decides.     Answers brightly, covering --

                  All good.

                  news. We are gonna celebrate
                  tonight!
                      (hugs her, then)

                  Do you ever wonder why we even try?
                  They don’t want us there except to
                  fill some diversity quota.

                  Honestly? For me the bank is just
                  an extension of my frat house.

                  Of course it is.

     She shakes her head, feeling disillusioned. Jamie puts the
     divider up between them and the driver.

                  Hey, you know what’s great for
                  stress relief? Physical activity.

     Puts his hand on her knee, wink wink. She removes it:

                             ANA
                  Know what else is? Murder.

                  I keep telling you, Lim. Not

               Please take the FDR. And step on
               it. I need a drink.

     PRELAP the sound of CHAMPAGNE POPPING and TIME CUT TO:

11   EXT. LINDSAY'S YARD / BARN - EVENING (N1)                 11

     Lindsay carries champagne and 3 glasses, striding toward the
     barn, where we see Party Guests heading inside. Ana catches
     up to her as they WALK AND TALK --

                         ANA
               Hey! V’s not here yet?

                         LINDSAY
               Told her to come at 7.

                         ANA
               She’s going to be so surprised. I
               can’t wait to see her face.

                         LINDSAY
               I know, me too! Okay, I’m dying to
               know: did you get the promotion?
                   (off her look, no)
               What? Those fools. Oh, Ana, I’m so
               sorry. My dad knows Tim Jeffries at
               the bank if you want him to put in
               a call.

                         ANA
               I don’t think that would help, but
               thanks. They said I was out of the
               office too much--

                         LINDSAY
               But that was because--

                         ANA
               They don’t want excuses. Look, the
               real problem with me not getting
               the promotion is... Now I’m not
               gonna have the investment money for
               Vivi’s restaurant.

                         LINDSAY
               What?! Oh my god. You promised. V
               was counting on it. She’s gonna be
               devastated.

                  Wow, I feel so much better now,
                  thanks.

                            LINDSAY
                  Sorry.

                            ANA
                  I hate to ask, but can you do it?

                            LINDSAY
                  $200K? No. I have zero cash flow.
                  Why don’t we ask my parents?

                            ANA
                  Please. They would never. They hate
                  that their golden son is dating the
                  help’s daughter.

                            LINDSAY
                  I don’t think that’s it. I admit
                  they aren’t Vivi’s biggest fans,
                  but I don’t know why.

     They LAND at a PATIO near the barn, just as Vivi approaches.

12   EXT. PATIO OUTSIDE LINDSAY’S BARN - DAY (D1)                 12

                            LINDSAY
                  I mean, look at her, who could not
                  love Vivi??

     Vivi arrives, in a pretty dress, hair and makeup done.

                            LINDSAY (CONT’D)
                  You look gorgeous.

                            VIVI
                  Do I?

     There’s that insecurity again. Lindsay has a maternal vibe
     toward Vivi, puts her arm around her protectively.

                            LINDSAY
                  Yes, you do. Always.
                      (taking her in)
                  You okay?

                            VIVI
                  Long day. Need a drink. Rory’s with
                  Graham up at the house. Is it just
                  us for dinner?

     Lindsay nods, hands out champagne. Vivi takes a big swig.

                            ANA
                  I’ll be a 5th wheel, as usual.

                            LINDSAY
                  Please. It’s not our fault you
                  never bring a date. You could have
                  all of Tinder here if you wanted.

                            ANA
                  I see your judgment. Don’t think I
                  don’t.

                            LINDSAY
                  Honestly? I’m not judging. I’m
                  jealous. You have sex with a new
                  person every week!

                            ANA
                  Well, how long has it been for you
                  and Graham?

                            LINDSAY
                      (cringes, then)
                  Three months? Maybe more?

                            VIVI
                  Wow. That’s--

                            ANA
                  A freakin’ emergency!! Linds, you
                  need to go get screwed. Like now.

     The girls know Lindsay’s marriage is troubled.

                            VIVI
                  You guys still seeing Dr. Lawrence?

                            LINDSAY
                  Couples therapy is a special kind
                  of hell. But what else can we do?

     Ana and V exchange looks, what do they know about marriage??

                              ANA
                  Have sex?

     That breaks the tension. Lindsay laughs, Ana has a point.

               Alright, a toast. To Vivi being
               cancer-free for one year!

     As they all raise their glasses to her, Vivi gets emotional.
     And and Lindsay look at her, concerned. She watches as the
     smiles fall from her friends’ faces.

                         ANA
               V? You okay?

     A beat -- is Vivi going to tell them what the doctor said?

                         VIVI
               Look at you two, you’ve done way
               too much worrying about me over the
               past few years.

     No -- she can’t tell them. Not now.

                         VIVI (CONT’D)
               I’m fine. It’s just that tonight
               puts everything in perspective.
               Life is short and you never know
               what’s gonna happen.

     She swallows her emotion and covers with bright energy:

                         VIVI (CONT’D)
               Which is why I’m so excited to get
               my restaurant going. I can’t thank
               you enough for investing, Ana. When
               you think you can get me that cold
               hard cash, girl?

     Yikes. Lindsay eyes Ana. Ana opens her mouth to tell her, but
     then sees something in Vivi's eyes. She can’t disappoint her.

                         ANA
               Getting it in the next few days.
               I’m so excited to invest!

     Lindsay shoots Ana a look -- She is??? WTF?

                         VIVI
               Amazing. Okay, I have presents.

     Vivi hands out 3 jewelry boxes.

                         ANA
               Lindsay’s getting one too? She
               didn’t invest.

               It was something my mom said to my
               brothers and me every day before
               she died. It was basically her
               dying wish. So, with whatever time
               we all have left, can you guys
               promise to do that for me?

                  V, I fell in love with you when we
                  were 16. But that was my little
                  secret. I didn’t have the guts to
                  tell you til 4 years ago. A year
                  into our relationship, you got
                  diagnosed with cancer. But even
                  battling cancer, those years were
                  the best of my life -- because I
                  got to spend them with you. Seeing
                  you get well has been my greatest
                  joy. And I can’t wait to spend the
                  rest of my life with you.

                         RORY
               Phew, babe, you made me sweat it
               there for a minute!

     They hug. But we come around, we see the tension under Vivi’s
     smile, she’s keeping a big secret from her new fiancé...

     WE WHIRL AROUND THE PARTY AGAIN, LANDING ON--

     ANA, clearly surprised by the engagement. She clocks RORY and
     LINDSAY’S PARENTS, TED and HELEN CRAWFORD, 60’s -- not
     thrilled. Ana crosses to them, defensive of Vivi.

                         ANA
               Ted, Helen, your son just got
               engaged to the most amazing girl in
               Seaford, where are your smiles?

                         HELEN
               Ana, dear, we’re over the moon.

     Helen is the type of “polite” society woman who says one
     thing when she clearly means another. The lie infuriates Ana.

                         ANA
               Good. Because Rory’s a very lucky
               man.

                         HELEN
               And to think, if we hadn’t hired
               Vivian’s father as our driver all
               those years ago, this wonderful
               event might never have occurred.

     At that, Ana accidentally on purpose spills a drink on Helen.

                         ANA
               How clumsy! I am so sorry.

     Off Ana, secret smile -- WE WHIRL AROUND THE PARTY TO:

15   INT. LINDSAY’S BARN - PARTY - NIGHT (N1)                   15

     LINDSAY, on the sidelines, overseeing the party. She urges on
     a passing waiter, “pass those trays.” Everyone else is having
     fun, but Lindsay looks a little...empty. Now her husband,
     GRAHAM LEIGHTON, 40’s, serious-loooking, approaches, the
     tension between them evident before they say a word.

                         LINDSAY
               Did you get the Juliet roses?

                         GRAHAM
               Got the Tuscany instead. Just as
               nice, half the price.

                         LINDSAY
                   (annoyed)
               Did the kids get to their
               sleepovers?

                         GRAHAM
               They didn’t want to go.

                         LINDSAY
               Did you try?

                         GRAHAM
               Not hard enough by your standards,
               I’m sure.

     Asshole. A waiter passes by, Linday chides him --

                         LINDSAY
               Don’t forget to offer a napkin.

     Graham eyes her, then --

                         GRAHAM
               Did that do it? Is the party
               perfect now?

                            LINDSAY
               Excuse me?

                          GRAHAM
               I’m curious. When is the moment you
               think, yes, I did it. This. Is.
               Perfect.
                   (then)
               That moment never comes for you,
               does it?

                            LINDSAY
                  Have you been drinking?

                            GRAHAM
                  Have you? Because God, I wish you
                  would. So much.

     Lindsay stares at him, willing him dead in her mind.

                             LINDSAY
                  It’s easy to make fun of me,
                  Graham. But I wish I had known
                  before we got married that I’d be
                  running our business and our family
                  on my own.

                            GRAHAM
                  Believe me, there are a lot of
                  things I wish I’d known about you
                  before I got married.

     They stew in silence. Lindsay gazes across the room, at Vivi
     and Rory, in love. Deep breath. She turns to Graham, trying--

                            LINDSAY
                  Look, Dr. Lawrence said we should
                  try more intimacy. I wanted the
                  kids to do sleepovers so we could,
                  you know... it’s been a while.

                             GRAHAM
                  So you wanna fuck me because Dr.
                  Lawrence told you to?
                      (then)
                  Something tells me I’m not gonna be
                  in the mood. Looks like you’ll have
                  to do that on your own too.

     He stalks off, leaving Lindsay alone to swallow her angry
     tears. She grabs a drink from a passing waiter’s tray, gulps
     it down in a few long pulls. Grabs another one.

     TIME PASSES as she stands there, watching Ana, Jamie, Vivi,
     Rory across the room, her party whirling on without her. She
     finishes her 2nd drink. Yes, that definitely helps...

     Then, she gets a TEXT: “Look up.” She does. Across the room,
     in a shadowy, out of the way corner -- Can it be? It is.
     NICK. Wow. He cleans up well. Lindsay approaches him and
     smiles, beyond surprised that he showed up.

16   INT. LINDSAY’S BARN - OUT OF THE WAY CORNER - NIGHT (N1)   16

                           LINDSAY
               You came.

                         NICK
               Had to. There’s an amazing woman
               here I’m obsessed with. Can’t get
               her out of my head.

     The heat between them is palpable. She flirts back--

                         LINDSAY
               Really. Who is she?

                         NICK
               She’s this cool chick. Funny,
               smart, super sexy. We’ve been
               flirting for a while now. She’s got
               me all hot and bothered. I just
               have this feeling, tonight’s the
               night.

                           LINDSAY
               For...?

     Leans in to her, whispers --

                         NICK
               I’m gonna try to convince her to
               have a torrid affair with me.

                         LINDSAY
               Whoa. How’re you gonna manage that?

                         NICK
               I was gonna start by putting my
               hand here, where no one can see it--
                   (his hand on her thigh)
               --then moving it up just a little
               further. See where things go from
               there.

     Linday doesn’t flinch, it’s as if the party has fallen away.

                         LINDSAY
               She sounds like a lucky girl.

                          NICK
               You got it wrong there. I’d be the
               lucky one.

     The morning after. Lindsay, in her robe, heads toward her
     kitchen. Stops when she sees her reflection in a mirror.
     Peers at her face -- last night, she had sex with someone
     other than her husband for the first time in 17 years. She
     heads into her (huge, Nancy Myers-esque) kitchen, pours
     coffee, daydreaming, as we POP TO:

     walks to her, holding a mug.

                         GRAHAM
               You came in late last night.

     Lindsay searches his eyes, does he suspect anything? Just
     then their children, CHARLOTTE, 16, and MAC, 10, enter. Both
     have their heads buried in screens.

                         CHARLOTTE
               1 AM. I heard you.

                         LINDSAY

               Hilary and Jake broke up. Major

     can’t help but swoon. Lindsay follows her stare.

                            LINDSAY (CONT’D)
                  Let’s go in!

     Vivi’s melting, she SO wants to, but she’s conflicted. She
     looks at the dress like it’s a dream that won’t come true.

                            VIVI
                  No. No, I can’t.

     Ana clearly isn’t interested, tries to keep walking--

                            LINDSAY
                  Why not? Of course you can!

     OFF Vivi, relenting, CUT TO--

25   INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DRESSING ROOM - DAY (D2)                  25

     A large dressing room. Vivi’s changing behind a curtained off
     area. Ana and Lindsay sit on a couch.

                            LINDSAY
                      (sotto, to Ana)
                  Hey, what happened last night?

                  Uh, you disappeared. Where were
                  you?

     Errr, having a torrid affair? She eyes Ana. Should she tell
     her?? She leans in to Ana --

                            LINDSAY
                  Actually, I was...

     Ana’s expectant, yes? ON Lindsay -- no, she can’t    --

                            LINDSAY (CONT’D)
                  The kids needed me. And don’t
                  change the subject. Why didn’t you
                  tell Vivi you don’t have the money?

                            ANA
                  Because I do.

                            LINDA
                  How? Where are you getting it?

                            ANA
                  Don’t worry about it, Mother Hen.
                  I’ve got it handled.
                      (changing the subject)
                  Did Rory tell you he was going to
                  propose last night?

                            LINDSAY
                  No. I had no idea!

                            ANA
                  Well, maybe it’s not too late to
                  change Vivi’s mind.

     Lindsay fixes her with an annoyed stare.

                            LINDSAY
                  Look, I know you’re not a fan of my
                  brother’s. I don’t know why since
                  he’s the greatest guy in the world--

                  Please. The summer solstice party?

     We GO BEHIND THE CURTAIN TO --

26   INT. BRIDAL SHOP DRESSING ROOM - BEHIND CURTAIN - DAY (D2) 26

     Vivi, in a bra and underwear, looks at herself in a mirror.

                         VIVI
               Fine. I’ll be out in a minute.

     She eyes the dress. Strapless. She’ll need to take off her
     bra. She covers her breasts with her hands as she removes her
     bra. Doesn’t want to see herself. But even with her hands
     covering her breasts, we can see the deep line of angry scars
     crossing them. (After a double mastectomy and reconstruction,
     her breast are misshapen and scarred, with no nipples.)

     Finally, Vivi drops her hands. Stares at her mangled breasts.
     Angry. SO angry. At everything that’s been taken from her.
     Everything that’s going to be taken from her.

                         LINDSAY (O.C)
               We can’t wait to see you in it!

     Vivi snaps out of it, grabs the dress as we go BACK TO --

     Lindsay’s PHONE BUZZES. She reads a TEXT FROM NICK: “Can't
     stop thinking about how sexy you are. When can I see you?”
     She blushes, smiles. Ana eyes her, then scootches over,
     trying to look at her phone. Lindsay JUMPS, hiding it.

                         LINDSAY
               Hey! What are you--?

                  Ah ha! Now I know where Lindsay
                  disappeared to last night...

                            LINDSAY

                  dam must have really burst, huh?
                  How is Graham in bed anyway?

                  I’m not going to kiss and tell.

                            ANA
                  Fine, then I will. Jamie was
                  surprisingly adept.

                            LINDSAY
                  You went home with Jamie?

     At that news, Vivi peeks her head out --

                            VIVI
                  What? You did?

     Vivi, still mostly behind the curtain, points to her back to
     be buttoned. Lindsay starts buttoning the many buttons, it’ll
     take a minute. We still can’t see the dress.

                            LINDSAY
                  I thought you weren’t going to
                  cross that line, since you guys are
                  friends. And you work together.

                            ANA
                  Well, I did, Judgy Judgers. And
                  it’s not like it’s a thing. One and
                  done, babies.

                            VIVI
                  I don’t get it, Ana. Since freshman
                  year of college, you’ve never dated
                  anyone for more than a week.

                            ANA
                  Wrong. Remember that sorority girl?
                  Spring break in Miami?

               Fine. Two weeks. Why don’t you want
               to settle down with a nice girl or
               guy?

                         ANA
               Look, ladies, monogamy is not only
               boring as hell, it’s a delusion
               topped only by marriage, which is
               emotionally, financially, and
               categorically inane. In fact, V,
               the best thing you could do for
               yourself right now is take off that
               dress, tell Rory the engagement’s
               off, and buy yourself a nice
               vibrator.

                         VIVI
               Then I guess you’ve never been in
               love. Because when you really love
               someone, you’ll do anything to hold
               onto that person.

     ON Vivi -- realizing she’s speaking some truth about herself.

     Meanwhile, Ana takes that in.

                         ANA
               Maybe you’re right. I guess, deep
               down, I assume I’m never going to
               end up with my forever person. I
               close myself off because I’m afraid
               of putting myself out there.

     Lindsay and Vivi are both shocked, Ana’s never been that open
     with them. Then Ana bursts out laughing--

                         ANA (CONT’D)
               Is that the sappy answer you guys
               wanted to hear? Now can we move on?

     Lindsay finishes the buttons and Vivi steps out in the gown
     and a veil. She’s quintessentially bridal -- and drop dead
     GORGEOUS. They all look at her in the mirror.

                         VIVI
               So? What do you guys think?

                         LINDAY
               Oh, Vivi, it’s stunning. I wish
               your mom was here to see this.

     Vivi stares at herself -- the dress is perfect. But the look
     in her eyes is bittersweet. Will she ever get to do this?

     Ana stares at Vivi, breathless, totally taken in --

                         ANA
               V, you’re... epically gorgeous.

     At that, Vivi turns and walks toward Ana with a smile, it’s
     reminiscent of a wedding procession.

                         VIVI
               Thanks. And you can joke all you
               want, Ana. But I think there’s
               truth to what you said. You are
               scared. But you are also epically
               wonderful. And anyone would be
               lucky to be with you.

     Vivi takes the veil from her head, positions it on Ana’s,
     staring her in the eyes.

                         VIVI (CONT’D)
               One day, Ana, it’s gonna happen.

     Vivi smiles as Ana blushes uncomfortably, and we realize
     something: ANA HAS FEELINGS FOR VIVI.

     ANGLE ON Lindsay, clocking this. Is she seeing what she
     thinks she’s seeing? Yep, she is: her best friend has
     feelings for other best friend, who happens to be her
     brother’s fiance’. Yikes. OFF Lindsay, we TIME CUT TO:

                  in there, going on about how
                  horrible marriage is, telling V to
                  end the engagement...? Vivi is in
                  love with my brother, she wants to
                  marry him, and you probably should
                  accept that.

     Ana fixes her with a stare.

                            ANA
                  Look, Mother Hen, Vivi and I may be
                  a few years younger than you, but
                  we’re big girls and we can make our
                  own decisions. And you and Graham
                  aren’t exactly killing it as role
                  models. So if I were you, I’d take
                  a hard look at my own soulless
                  marriage before I gave anyone else
                  relationship advice.

               Sure, I think I’ve seen you around

               And you do a bang up job. Think it
               was you who planted those daisies
               outside the women’s club?

     Was that a dig? Sure felt like one.

               I take it you’re working with
               Lindsay on the Jacksons’ remodel.

               Yeah, I’m one of the new

                         GRAHAM
               Hope you’re good. Because our

                  with you.

                            GRAHAM
                  Be my guest.

30   INT. CLIENT’S HOME - DAY (D3)                               30

     Lindsay and Nick enter the home.

                             NICK
                      (business-like)
                  Right over here. What color do you
                  want this?

     Nick teases Lindsay by leaning in close but not touching her.

                            NICK (CONT’D)
                  How are you?

                            LINDSAY
                  I’m well, thanks.

                             NICK
                  You look... a hell of a lot better
                  than well.

     He runs his eyes over her body, making clear what he wants.
     She blushes, the heat between them rising.

                            NICK (CONT’D)
                  I need to see you.

     Lindsay subconsciously glances back toward Graham.

                  PM.

     As he brushes by her body and exits, we're OFF a burning
     Lindsay, what is she going to do--?

                            ANA (PRELAP)
                  The problem is, once I do it, I
                  can’t go back.

31   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY (D3)                            31

     Ana and Jamie huddle together in a glass conference room,
     illuminated by the glow of Ana’s laptop. Ana stares at the
     screen. A trade queued up: BUY 500,000 shares of MedCo. Her
     cursor hovers over “Buy.”

                             ANA
                  If what you say is true, and that
                  drug gets FDA approval, MedCo’s
                  price will skyrocket, while it’s
                  unlikely that we’ll get caught.
                      (then)
                  But if we do? Prison, career up in
                  flames, reputations ruined.

                            JAMIE
                  So why are you doing it?

                            ANA
                  Can I trust you not to say
                  anything?

                              JAMIE
                  Probably?

                            ANA
                  I’m investing in Vivi’s restaurant.

                            JAMIE
                  Jesus. Can’t she take out a loan?

                             ANA
                  No collateral. Her family doesn’t
                  have money. I’m the only option
                  she’s got.

     A beat as Ana reflects on that --

                            ANA (CONT’D)
                  It’s amazing. The girl survived
                  cancer, gets up off the mat and
                  wants to start her own business --
                  and in a town full of money, no one
                  will help her except the other
                  brown person.

     Just then, two Older White Guys walk by, all buddy-buddy with
     a Younger White Guy. Jamie nods toward the younger guy.

                            JAMIE
                  Did you hear? Greg VanLewin -- he’s
                  the one who got your promotion.

     This lands on Ana. She should’ve known.

                            ANA
                  See? It’s the same everywhere. If I
                  were treated fairly by this firm, I
                  wouldn’t have to resort to doing
                  this!
                      (off his look)
                  What?

                            JAMIE
                  Don’t do that. Don’t rationalize
                  this. You’re better than that.
                  You’re better than them.

                            ANA
                  It’s not rationalizing if it’s
                  true, asshole! No one here is gonna
                  help me get ahead, I have to do it
                  myself!

     Suddenly riled up, Ana presses CLICK. It’s done.

                            ANA (CONT’D)
                  There, I did it. No regrets.

     She grabs her coat and starts to go.

                            JAMIE
                  Where are you going?

                            ANA
                  To the bank. To pick up a loan
                  check for $200K. I’ll pay it back
                  when we make our profit in a few
                  months.

               Wow, dude. I hope Vivi appreciates
               what you’re doing for her.

                         ANA
               Oh, she definitely doesn’t. V’s as
               straight-laced as they come. If she
               knew where I was getting this
               money? She’d kill me.

     OFF that, TIME CUT TO --

32   EXT. VIVI’S RESTAURANT SPACE - PATIO - DAY                 32

     Dark water. A churning ocean. The same water as in our
     Teaser. PULL OUT to find Vivi, Rory, Ana, Vivi’s dad Emilio,
     and her brothers Eddie and Daniel -- all looking out at the
     ocean from the outdoor patio of a vacant restaurant space.
     They take in the space and view, impressed.

                           DANIEL
               Dang!

                         EMILIO
               It’s perfect, mija.

                         EDDIE
               Mom would definitely approve, V.

                         RORY
               Can you really afford this?

                         VIVI
               Thanks to Ana, yes.

     Vivi holds up the check from Ana. Daniel grabs it, reacts --

                         DANIEL
               What? V, you’re rich!

     Vivi and Ana exchange smiles. Rory clocks this, jealous.

                         EMILIO
               You’re a good friend, Anita.

                           VIVI
               The best.

                         ANA
               I’d do anything for Vivi.

     An annoyed Rory eyes Ana. Can’t help himself--

                      (annoyed)
                  I wasn’t implying otherwise.

     Daniel’s still marveling at the check.

                            DANIEL
                  How does it feel to make all that
                  money, Ana? Asking for a friend.

     Ana’s uncomfortable, but gives Daniel the answer he wants --

                            ANA
                  It feels... pretty damn good.

     She smiles. At that, Rory chimes in --

                            RORY
                  Does it, though?
                      (off her look)
                  It feels pretty damn good to
                  manipulate markets and maximize
                  corporate greed at the cost of
                  creating the greatest inequality
                  this country has ever seen??

     Everyone stares at him, then the boys erupt --

                 DANIEL                            EDDIE
     Whoa, downer, man!                Come on, dude, not the time!

                            ANA
                  I’ll handle this, boys.

     Ana squares off with Rory--

                            ANA (CONT’D)
                  People who can’t hack it on Wall
                  Street are always the first to put
                  down Wall Street.

               I’ve been working for your father
               since you were 12 years old, do you
               believe that? And now we’re going
               to be abuelos together. Who could
               have predicted? I want at least
               four -- two boys and two girls.

     CLOSE ON The Greenbriar Inn. Pull out to find Lindsay sitting
     in her car, staring at the inn. Her watch reads 1:15 PM.

     She types a TEXT to ANA: “Need to talk to you. You were right
     about my marriage. I did something terrible. I need you to
     talk me out of doing it again.” She stares at the TEXT, then
     DELETES it without sending. Puts her phone away. Looks up at
     the inn. Bites her nails. Then shakes her head. She can’t do
     this. She starts the car. BUT then, as she puts her hands on
     the steering wheel, she glances at her BRACELET. CUT TO--

34   INT. GREENBRIAR INN - FOYER - DAY (D3)                    34

               Hello?

     Maybe Nick's not even here? She's about to turn and go... But

     rooms. Keys to guest rooms. This is all moving too quickly.

                            LINDSAY
                  Yeah. Um, I can’t stay though...

                  What? You have to stay. Pierre
                  would be so disappointed.

     He points over her shoulder. Through the shadows she sees: a
     dining room, a lone table set for a romantic lunch.

                            NICK (CONT’D)
                  He’s not usually open for lunch. I

                  Rory and I are getting married,
                  Ana.

                            ANA
                  Oh, I know. Are you sure you want
                  to do that?

     Vivi’s taken aback.

                             VIVI
                  Of course I am.
                      (then)
                  What the hell is your problem?

                            ANA
                  My problem is -- you worked your
                  ass off to survive growing up in an
                  all white town, get a scholarship
                  to college, beat cancer, create
                  this business... you deserve better
                  than some entitled rich kid.

     Vivi’s comes back firmly --

                            VIVI
                  His parents may be rich and
                  entitled. Rory’s not.

                            ANA
                  Okay, also? I don’t trust him.

                            VIVI
                  Why?

                            ANA
                  That summer stolstice party? When
                  he disappeared for hours...

                            VIVI
                  He got drunk and passed out
                  somewhere! Nothing happened.

                            ANA
                  I don’t believe that.

     Vivi erupts, she’s had enough --

                            VIVI
                  I don’t know where this is coming
                  from Ana, but you’re wrong. Rory’s
                  the best person I know. He’s...
                  he’s... done everything for me. He
                  held me while I vomited from
                  chemo... he cried with me when my
                  breasts got removed--

     But Ana’s not having it --

                            ANA
                  So did Lindsay and I, just for the
                  record.

     Vivi continues, erupting--

               --and even though my body’s an
               endless fucking nightmare, he still
               wants to marry me. He would never,
               EVER deceive me!

     This lands hard on Vivi -- meanwhile SHE’S deceiving HIM.

                          VIVI (CONT’D)
               I have to go.
                   (then)
               Look, Ana, you’ve been an
               incredible friend to me. Since we
               were roommates in college, and I
               had no money and you’d pay for me
               whenever we did anything, you’ve
               always been there for me. And I’m
               so grateful to have you as a
               partner in this restaurant. But if
               you can’t get on board with Rory,
               maybe we shouldn’t do this.

     Ana takes her in. Vivi looks serious. A beat, then--

                         ANA
               I’ll get on board.

     Vivi nods and heads out, leaving Ana staring at that dark

                  There was no way to say no.

     The next day. In the living room of her modest but warm
     family home, we find Vivi standing at a corner SHRINE to her
     MOTHER: Candles, a PHOTO of her mother, ALMA, Latina, 30’s,
     beautiful, holding a precious LITTLE GIRL -- Vivi as a child.
     As we come in CLOSER, we realize that Vivi is praying --

                   (in SPANISH)
               Mama, I come to you today with
               faith so small I cannot see a way.
               Please talk to God and ask Him to
               bring a miracle into my life. Ask
               Him to heal me, change me,
               strengthen me, in body, soul, and
               spirit. Gracias, Madre.

     Eddie enters as Vivi finishes, crossing herself. He lets her
     finish, then, softly --

                         EDDIE
               Didn’t know you were coming by.

                         VIVI
               Just wanted to say hi to Mom.

     He sees the emotion in Vivi’s face. She smiles through it.

                          VIVI (CONT’D)
               We’re lucky we had her for as long

               We’re lucky they caught yours
               earlier.

     Ah, so their mother died of the same disease. A lot of
     history with cancer in this family. But Vivi doesn’t want to
     talk about cancer right now --

                  6 plain, 6 salt. Plus 4 black and
                  whites. You got it, Mrs. Leighton.

                            LINDSAY
                  Thanks, Jerry.

     As she waits, Linday spots something, walks toward a woman.

                            LINDSAY (CONT’D)
                  Vivi?

     Vivi turns around, taken aback to find Lindsay--

                            VIVI
                  Oh! Hey! What are you doing here?

                            LINDSAY
                  Just errands. What are you doing in
                  the city? I thought you had work
                  stuff to do in Seaford.

                            VIVI
                  I just popped in to... check out a
                  restaurant supply shop downtown.
                  Had to get my bagels.

     Vivi spots Lindsay’s lingerie bag. Remembers what Eddie said.

                            VIVI (CONT’D)
                  So you and Graham are really going
                  at it after that dry spell, huh?

     She watches Lindsay’s response closely.

                            LINDSAY
                  Oh, haha, I was just in the city to
                  pick up this wallpaper for a client
                  and I needed new bras. Nude. Very
                  boring. You took the train in?

                            VIVI
                  Yep.

                            LINDSAY
                  I have my car with me. Come with me
                  to run an errand. Then I’ll drive
                  us downtown to your shop and we can
                  go back to Seaford together--

               Oh, God, thanks! I wish I could,
               but I can’t. I have to get going.
               See you back in Seaford later?

     Vivi hurries out of the store. Lindsay, taken aback, watches
     her go -- WTF?

               Ms. Vasquez! Your order’s ready!

                         LINDSAY
               I’ll take it, Jerry.

     OFF Lindsay, wheels turning --

               I’m telling you, it was weird.

42   INT. ANA'S OFFICE - DAY (D4)                              42

     Lindsay's come by Ana's office, concerned about Vivi.

                         LINDSAY
               And then she ran out of there,
               without her bagels!

                         ANA
                   (stone-faced)
               So you’re not here to apologize for
               getting all up in me the other day?

     Ah. So they’re doing this.

                         LINDSAY
               Look. Okay. You’re right. I
               shouldn’t have gotten involved in
               your money, or your friendship with
               Vivi.

     Ana nods. Good. But Lindsay’s not letting her off the hook --

                         LINDSAY (CONT’D)
               At the same time... I was
               vulnerable about my sex life and my
               marriage, and you threw it back in
               my face. Some things aren't easy to
               be honest about, even with your
               best friends.

     This lands on both of them.

                  So, what’s going on with Vivi?

                            LINDSAY
                  It seemed like she didn’t want to
                  tell me where she was going. And
                  hasn’t she been acting a little
                  weird lately? I’m worried.

     Ana pulls out her phone. Lindsay looks over her shoulder.

                            LINDSAY (CONT’D)
                  You have Vivi on Find My Friends!?
                  Talk about weird.

                  You don’t remember? The 3 of us put
                  it on our phones after we got
                  separated at that Lizzo concert.

                            LINDSAY
                  So... you guys can track me?

                  Sure. Not that we’d want to with
                  your boring life.

     Lindsay discreetly turns off her own Find My Friends--

                            ANA (CONT’D)
                  She's heading uptown on Lex...
                  turning on 67th.

                             LINDSAY
                  Huh. The supply shop is downtown.
                       (then, realizing)
                  Ana, you know what's on 67th and

     The camera pans across our 3 ladies, sitting on a bench
     together: anxious Ana, stoic Vivi, landing on a sad Lindsay.

                         LINDSAY
               Whenever you’re ready to talk, V,
               we’re here.

                             VIVI
               I--    My--

     She chokes up.

                   (determined)
               V, if your cancer is back, we’ll
               beat it just like we did before.
               That’s all there is to it. We are
               not gonna let it get you. I promise-

                         VIVI
               It’s not back! But you’re wrong,
               Ana. Because one way or another,
               cancer always gets you.

     Ana and Lindsay react -- WTF is going on?

                         VIVI (CONT’D)
               The tests just confirmed it. I have
               ovarian failure due to alkylating
               cytotoxics. I can’t have children.

     Ana and Lindsay look at her, heartbroken.

                  We would have mourned with you, V.

                            VIVI
                  Because when I tell it to you two?
                  Then it’s real. And then things
                  start to disappear. And I don’t
                  want them to go. Not yet. I’ve
                  already had my mother taken away
                  from me and my boobs and my hair
                  and now my chance to have kids is
                  gone, and when Rory finds out,
                  believe me, he’ll disappear too.

                            LINDSAY
                  Rory doesn’t know?

                            VIVI
                  You should hear him go on about
                  having kids. He wants five.

                  Screw him if he doesn’t want you

               Okay, Ms. Perfect! Like you tell

               better than the rest of us, so stop

               Hey, let’s all take a breath--

     Vivi’s horrified by what she just said.

               I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said
               that--

                            LINDSAY
               It’s okay.

     Vivi softens, gets emotional.

                         VIVI
               I know I have to tell Rory. I’m
               just scared. I can lose everything
               else. Not him.

                         LINDSAY
               I promise, I won’t tell him. You
               tell him whenever you’re ready. In

     At that, Vivi breaks down. As they hug her, we're OFF our 3

     through the window, confused by what she sees. What is that??

46   EXT. LINDSAY'S BACKYARD - DAY (D5)                           46

     Lindsay approaches something unseen in her yard. Suddenly, a
     hand covers her eyes! WTF?! She gasps! Then a voice:

                               CHARLOTTE
                  Guess who?

                            LINDSAY

                  Come with me.

     Charlotte leads her to a sheet hanging from a laundry line.

                            CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                  Open your eyes.

     The sheet drops, revealing Graham and Mac, sitting in the
     middle of a gorgeous ROSE GARDEN. A tablecloth and picnic,
     candles and twinkly lights. It’s pretty magical. Lindsay
     looks to Graham, questioning--

                            GRAHAM
                  Don’t look at me. It was the kids’
                  idea.

                  But... why?

     Charlotte points to a homemade wooden sign: “LINDSAY LEIGHTON

     She turns to Graham. He shrugs, aloof.

                  They insisted I make you a rose
                  garden. I knew you wouldn’t be

             MAC (CONT’D)                          CHARLOTTE
     Mom?!                               What’s wrong, Mom?

     Lindsay looks at her family --

                            LINDSAY
                  I screwed up.

     OMG. She’s going to tell them about Nick??

                            LINDSAY (CONT’D)
                  I’ve been way too controlling. I
                  expect way too much, I always want
                  everything to be perfect... I must
                  be awful to live with!

     Lindsay hugs the kids, then pulls back to look at them --

                            LINDSAY (CONT’D)
                  I love this garden. I love that you
                  guys did this. I’m sorry you had to
                  worry for even one second that I
                  wouldn’t. I’m so sorry.

     She’s surprised when Graham comes to her.

                            GRAHAM
                  Hey. You’re not that bad.

     He hugs her, whispers in her ear.

                            GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                  And you’re not the only one who’s
                  been hard to live with. I’m sorry,
                  too.

     Off the two of them -- this doesn't magically solve their
     problems, but for now, Lindsay can hear the ice breaking.

     As her family starts laying out the picnic, Lindsay gets a
     TEXT from Nick. She steps away to check it: “Counting the
     minutes till I see you tomorrow.” She stares at it. Makes a
     decision. TEXTS Nick: “I can’t make it tomorrow.

     I’m really sorry. You know I’m married. I don’t think I can
     do this anymore.”

     OFF Lindsay, appreciating her family--

     CLOSE ON a FOR RENT sign being removed from a window. REVEAL
     Vivi holding it. As she looks proudly around at her new
     restaurant -- this is her baby now -- she makes a decision.
     She TEXTS Ana and Lindsay: “Can you guys meet me at the new
     place tonight?” Ana TEXTS back: “Do we get dinner?” Vivi:
     “Yes. IF you help me.” Lindsay replies: “With...?” Vivi: “I
     have to tell Rory. But I don’t know how.” OFF Vivi, knowing
     what she has to do --

48   INT. ANA'S OFFICE - EVENING (D5)                          48

     Ana’s at her desk when there’s a knock at her door. The door
     opens, REVEALING Rory. Ana’s taken aback, uneasy about
     holding’s Vivi’s secret.

                         ANA
               This is unexpected.

                         RORY
               Sorry to just drop in. I... need to
               ask you something -- and I know I
               can always count on you to be
               brutally honest.

                         ANA
                   (uh oh)
               Okay...?

                         RORY
               Do you think Vivi’s okay? She seems
               different lately. Distracted.

     Oh God. Ana’s not sure how to answer this...

                         ANA
               She does seem to have a lot on her
               mind. Maybe it’s just getting
               engaged? That’s a big transition.

                         RORY
               I hope she’s not having second
               thoughts already.

     He laughs, but it’s clear he’s feeling anxious. Ana remembers
     her pledge to Vivi to get on board with them.

                  Look, Rory, Vivi loves you, I know
                  that.

     Rory looks relieved.

                            RORY
                  Thanks. And I’m sorry about the
                  other day. It was my fault. I was
                  just jealous that you’re doing so
                  well at work.

                            ANA
                  Yeah, Vivi mentioned that.

                             RORY
                  She did?

     Rory’s embarrassed, but Ana extends an olive branch--

                            ANA
                  She also said you might even like
                  to find a job on Wall Street. I’d
                  be happy to put in a good word--

                            RORY
                  Thanks, yeah, I was considering it
                  for half a second, but then I
                  remembered, I freakin’ hate Wall
                  Street.

                            ANA
                  Oh, I remember.

                            RORY
                  The irony is, when I mentioned
                  leaving to my boss, he offered me a
                  new job. Too good to turn down.

                            ANA
                  That’s great.

                            RORY
                  Remember that task force I
                  mentioned? The one that got you

                  Yeah?

               dealings on Wall Street.

     Ana’s taken aback, but she covers well.

                         ANA
               Wow. Lucky them.

     Rory starts to exit. Then he stops and JOKES --

               Yeah, so you better watch your
               back, Ana. Because from now on, the

     watching it from the outside, the dialogue low, almost MOS.

                          GRAHAM

                I heard. Good news for us. He’d
                never come down on us--we’re his

                          ANA
                I don’t think he sees me that way.

                            ANA
                  I don’t care. I’m getting rid of
                  them.

                  Ana. Listen to me. You can’t do
                  that. You made your choice. Now you
                  have to live with it.

     She takes this in, knowing he’s right --

                  No one else knows?

                      (hand on heart)
                  Just us.

     Ana, trying to stay calm, EXITS. Jamie looks at his desk
     phone -- we realize he was on a SPEAKER CALL with someone
     else the whole time, they overheard the whole thing. Jamie’s
     frustrated--

                            JAMIE (CONT’D)
                  Fuck. I told you she’d break. No,
                  I’ll keep her in line. What choice
                  do we have?

     We’re left wondering -- who the hell was he talking to?

     Nick walks off. OFF Lindsay, closing the door, her heart
     pounding. She opens the box to reveal: sexy lingerie. She
     quickly stuffs it back in the box. Yikes. Looks like
     Lindsay’s secret lover has a little issue with boundaries...

53   INT. RORY AND VIVI'S COTTAGE - EVENING (N5)                  53

     In the darkened house, Vivi approaches Rory. It looks like
     he’s been crying. His tone is shocked emotion, not anger.

                            VIVI

                  Did your sister say something to

                  Lindsay? No...

     It lands on him that his sister knew and didn’t tell him.

                            RORY (CONT’D)
                  I... ran into Dr. Beth. She assumed
                  I already knew and said too much.

                            VIVI

                  Yes.

                            RORY
                  Okay. Because when she told me, I
                  said, no, that’s impossible. Vivi
                  and I just made a promise to spend

               Wait until it sinks in that you
               can’t have your own children.

                         RORY
               We will have our own children.
               We’ll adopt them. Or use an egg
               donor. I don’t care. All I care
               about is raising them with you. V,
               I would fight through anything --
               fertility issues, cancer, my
               parents, your best friend -- to be
               with you.

     He just doesn’t understand --

                         RORY (CONT’D)
               What is stopping you from believing
               that?

                         VIVI
               I don’t know. All I know is, when
               we fell in love, my life turned
               into a fairy tale.

     Rory smiles. Then she continues --

                         VIVI (CONT’D)
               But I just have this terrible
               feeling that one day, it’s all
               going to come crashing down.

     Rory’s taken aback --

                         RORY
               V, it won’t. Come here.

     He takes her in his arms. Off Vivi, closing her eyes,
     savoring his protective hug. But as she opens her eyes, we
     have a sense of foreboding, which TAKES US ACROSS TO --

54   EXT. RORY AND VIVI’S COTTAGE - NIGHT (N5)                    54

     Vivi’s exiting the house, surprised to find Helen Crawford,
     Rory’s mother, in the shadows of the driveway.

                         VIVI
               Helen?

                         HELEN
               Evening, Vivian.

                            VIVI
                  I’m just on my way out to the
                  restaurant.

                            HELEN
                  It’s fine. I’m here to see Rory.

                            VIVI
                  Okay, well, nice to see you.

     Vivi’s about to go, but then, emboldened by her talk with
     Rory, she turns bravely to Helen --

                            VIVI (CONT’D)
                  Helen. I don’t know what I did to
                  get on your bad side. But Rory made
                  it very clear to me tonight that he
                  wants a life with me, no matter
                  what. I’m going to be part of your
                  family.

     Helen smiles at her nicely.

                            HELEN
                  Sweet girl. Ever since you were
                  little, when your father started
                  working for us, and you’d help him
                  wash our cars or sweep out our
                  garage, you’ve always been so
                  exceedingly bright.

     Vivi smiles. This is going well. But then Helen continues--

                            HELEN (CONT’D)
                  So it can’t come as a surprise to
                  you that I will never let that
                  happen.

     Vivi flashes with anger. She moves toward Helen--

                            VIVI
                  I’d watch how you speak to me.

     Vivi drops her voice, this is furtive, mysterious --

                            VIVI (CONT’D)
                  Summer solstice?

     There’s that summer solstice party again -- the same one
     where Ana claims Rory was up to no good...

               I know what happened that night.
               Upstairs at your house. I was
               there.

     Vivi lets that land. But Helen doesn’t blink.

                         HELEN
               Actually, there are quite a few
               things you don’t know about that
               night. Things you won’t want to
               know. So I’d forget whatever you
               think you saw.

     Helen heads inside, then stops, turns back --

                         HELEN (CONT’D)
               Oh, and by the way, Vivian, what
               exactly were you doing in our house
               that night?

     With that, Helen goes. OFF Vivi, head spinning, CUT TO--

55   INT. VASQUEZ FAMILY HOME - LIVING ROOM                     55

     Vivi furtively enters her childhood home, not making a sound.
     No one’s home. She goes to her mother’s shrine, feels around
     behind it. Ah ha. She pulls something that was hidden behind
     the shrine, tucks it away in her purse. Kisses her fingers
     and then touches her mother’s photo with her fingers. Exits --

     --and enters her restaurant space. We follow her through the
     main dining area and kitchen, into a small office, where she
     opens a closet door, revealing a SAFE. She takes the item out
     of her purse -- a small package wrapped in black -- puts it
     in the safe, locks it. As she stares at the locked safe, we
     FLASHBACK POP TO:

57   INT. HELEN AND TED’S HOUSE - HALLWAY/BEDROOM - FLASHBACK   57

     We see fragmented POPS: Vivi walks furtively along a hallway.
     She’s stopped by unsettling noises behind a door. Grunts and
     groans. Sex? An argument? Vivi edges closer. Hears a thump.
     Peers through the crack, sees a horrified Ted Crawford
     staring at something. Before we see what it is --

     BACK TO SCENE. Vivi shakes her head, wishing she could forget
     that memory, as we CUT TO:

58   EXT. VIVI’S RESTAURANT SPACE - NIGHT (N5)                 58

     A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA being plopped on a table. A subdued
     Lindsay, Ana and Vivi sit on the patio, overlooking the
     water. As Vivi pours the shots--

                         VIVI
               Thanks for coming tonight, ladies.

     Vivi raises her glass to toast, but before she can -- a
     stressed Ana and Lindsay both shoot theirs back.

                            VIVI (CONT’D)
               Good plan.

     Vivi throws hers back, too. Pours three more.

                         VIVI (CONT’D)
               So, I picked a name for my
               restaurant. Tres Amigas.

                            ANA
               Love.

                          LINDSAY
               It’s perfect, V.
                   (then)
               So, you need our advice on how to
               tell Rory?

                         VIVI
               Nope.
                   (off their looks)
               He knows. And he was very
               understanding. We’re still getting
               married.

     Lindsay’s relieved and pleased. Ana, less so. Lindsay raises
     a glass --

                         LINDSAY
               Well, I guess it just goes to show,
               secrets are never a good idea.

     Ana raises her glass --

                         ANA
               True. Better to bare your soul.

     Vivi joins in --

                  One hundred percent. Honesty,
                  always.

     All three of them shoot their shots. Then, they look out at
     the view, each lost in her own world of worry --

     ON ANA -- covering major anxiety about her crime...

     ON LINDSAY -- unsure of what Nick will do next...

     ON VIVI -- holding the darkest secret of them all...
