INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - 5:30 AM

A cursor blinks on a blank computer screen. Text appears.

I have nothing to say.

The words are deleted.

CAIRO SWEET, 17 and plain in a dark hooded sweatshirt, sits
alone at a table in a large kitchen. It’s dark - the only
lights coming from her computer screen, a dim bulb above a
massive chef’s stove, and an expensive television hanging on
the wall, playing NOW, VOYAGER on mute.

She shuts the laptop and stares at the TV a moment. Grainy      *
black and white flickers cast shadows across her impassive      *
face. Behind her, the sun is just starting to rise gray-pink    *
in a winter sky.

She unmutes the television just as Paul Henreid asks Bette
Davis if they should “just have a cigarette on it” in the
final scene of the film.

Bette Davis and Paul Henreid are reflected in Cairo’s pupils.   *

EXT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

The house is a massive white Greek Revival hidden in the        *
trees. A haunted place. A forgotten tomb in the woods.          *

Cairo shuts a glass door behind her.                            *

We follow her down a long path overgrown with thorny plants     *
and dead leaves toward the porte corchere.


EXT. WOODS - EARLY MORNING

Cairo walks through the pathless trees. Mist hangs low and
blue over the ground. Kudzu vines creep over everything.

Eventually, she breaks through the tree line. Ahead of her is
a brick building surrounded by dilapidated sports fields.


INT. BENSON AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MORNING

Cairo walks down the empty hallway of an old school that
hasn’t been updated to the more industrial prison aesthetic
of modern institutions.


INT. BENSON AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY -MORNING

Cairo passes several wooden doors to different rooms, finally
stopping at one at the end of the corridor.

ROOM 416 - MR. MILLER, CREATIVE WRITING

Soft classical wafts from the open door.


INT. JONATHAN MILLER’S CLASSROOM - MORNING

SYMPHONY NO 6. in A Minor: 3 by MAHLER

Thick oriental rugs over the floors. Lamps are used in place
of overhead lights. Floor to ceiling bookshelves and
portraits of famous artists cover the walls. Desks spread out
in concentric circles around a large, mid-century wooden desk
at the front of the room.

A VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY banner hangs above a classic green
chalkboard, on which is written MR. MILLER - CREATIVE WRITING
in beautiful, cursive handwriting. Beneath that, a list of
authors - Nabakov, Twain, DeSade, Vonnegut.

Cairo chooses a seat in front and takes a stack of books from
her bag, opening her library copy of James Joyce’s FINNEGANS
WAKE.

JONATHAN MILLER (elegant, warm, 30s) enters carrying a stack
of freshly printed pages. He wears a uniform of camel and
olive. He isn’t expecting a student this early in his class.

                    JONATHAN
          Good morning.

She looks up.

                    CAIRO
          Good morning.

                    JONATHAN
          Class doesn’t start for another
          hour.

                    CAIRO
          I know.
          I don’t like crowds.

                    JONATHAN
          Do you live very far?

                    CAIRO
          Just down the road, in Lovell
          Hills.

                       JONATHAN
          Wow, nice.

                    CAIRO
              (shrugging)
          My parents are lawyers.

                       JONATHAN
          What kind?

                    CAIRO
          The expensive kind.

                    JONATHAN
          Do you want to be a lawyer?

                    CAIRO
          About as much as I want to be a
          high school student.

He considers her.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                 5.


                    JONATHAN
          What’s your name?

                    CAIRO
          Cairo Sweet.

                    JONATHAN
          I’m Mr. Miller.

                    CAIRO
          I know.

He hands her the reading list for the semester.

                    JONATHAN
          I assume you got this before the
          holidays - have you had a chance to
          look it over?

                    CAIRO
          I’ve read it.

                    JONATHAN
          I know it seems like a lot but I
          promise we’ll move through them
          quick enough.

                    CAIRO
          I mean I read the whole list.

                    JONATHAN
          You read these books?

                    CAIRO
          Yes.

                    JONATHAN
          There are eighteen books on this
          list.

                    CAIRO
          I party hard.

WINNIE BLACK (17) enters as she would her own home. Every
space is hers. She sheds bags and coats and food and paper
until finally she is revealed - glorious, fleshy, femme. She
pauses after her performance to give Jon a once over.

                    JONATHAN
          Winnie.

                    WINNIE
          D’ja miss me?
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)               6.


                       JONATHAN
          No.

                    WINNIE
          That’s too bad.
              (re: his outfit)
          Is J.Crew endorsing you for this?

                    JONATHAN
              (re: her hair)
          Nice feathers.

                    WINNIE
          You like? They’re sewn in.

                    JONATHAN
          How do you wash it?

                       WINNIE
          You don’t.

                       JONATHAN
          Cool.

Winnie leans on Jonathan’s desk, facing Cairo. Jonathan
writes the definitions for CENSORSHIP and SUPPRESSION on the
chalkboard.

                    WINNIE
              (to Cairo)
          You’re overdressed as usual, I see.

                    CAIRO
          Your underwear as usual, I see.

Winnie smiles and spreads her legs wider for Cairo.

                    WINNIE
          What’s on the agenda today, Killer
          Miller?

                    JONATHAN
          Nothing that will interest you, I’m
          sure.

                       WINNIE
          Try me.

                    JONATHAN
          Censorship.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                 7.


                    WINNIE
          Boring. Censorship is dead. It
          can’t exist with the accessibility
          of today’s technology.

                    JONATHAN
          It’s not just the banning of books,
          Winnie. It’s the banning of ideas.
          And without ideas, what are we?

                    WINNIE
          Instafamous.

                    JONATHAN
          You’re not wrong. Do you know why?

                    WINNIE
          Yeah, do you?

                    CAIRO
          The ease of discovery puts the
          responsibility on the learner -
          ignorance is a product of laziness,
          not limitation.

                    JONATHAN
          Perhaps you two should lead class
          today.

                    WINNIE
          Or perhaps you could come up with
          something more interesting to
          teach, Teach.

                    JONATHAN
          If you find my class so tedious,
          why did you elect to take it again?

                    WINNIE
          I like your outfits.

Winnie sits on Cairo’s desk and her stomach growls, loud. She
rubs her belly.

                    WINNIE (CONT'D)
              (to her tummy)
          What’s that you say? You need a
          chicken biscuit?
              (it growls again)
          And a Coke?
              (to Cairo)
          You heard the boss. It’s
          chickybisky Coke-y time. Let’s go.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                   8.


                    CAIRO
          You know chicken biscuits are made
          of chicken, right?

                    WINNIE
          So?

                    CAIRO
          So I thought you were vegan.

                    WINNIE
          New semester, new me.

                    JONATHAN
          Let’s hope.

                    CAIRO
          You want anything Mr. Miller?

                    JONATHAN
          No thanks, Cairo. Sweet of you to
          ask.

                    WINNIE
          I see what you did there.

Cairo and Winnie exit.

Jonathan surveys the room and looks at the stack of books on
Cairo’s desk. Finnegans Wake. The Paris Review. And UNDER THE
ROOFS OF PARIS by Henry Miller. This surprises him. He takes
the book and opens it.

BORIS FILLMORE (30s, charming, smarter than he looks) enters
with a pastry box and two coffees.

                    BORIS
          Pretty suggestive for seniors,
          don’t you think?

Jonathan shuts the book. Boris sets his stuff on Cairo’s
desk.

                    JONATHAN
          It’s a student’s.

                    BORIS
          What’s her name?

                    JONATHAN
          How do you know it’s a girl?

                    BORIS
          Boys are too lazy to read porn.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                 9.


                    JONATHAN
          It’s not porn.
          It’s not just porn.

                    BORIS
          Every other word in that book is
          peen, poon, pee in the poon, pussy
          play peen poon and also anal. Gimme
          that.

He snatches the book from Jonathan and walks around the room,
reciting. Jonathan follows him.

                    BORIS (CONT'D)
              (reciting)
          “Marcelle wants me to fuck her. She
          leaps onto the couch and pushes
          herself between the girl and
          me...there’s something so
          fascinatingly horrible about her
          that I can’t move-”

                    JONATHAN
          Okay.

                    BORIS
              (still reading)
          “-I turn my back to get away from
          her when I feel her bald cuntlet
          touching the end of my dick-”

                    JONATHAN
          OKAY.

                    BORIS
          Tell me her name.

                    JONATHAN
          Cairo Sweet.

Boris grins.

                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
          What’s funny?

                    BORIS
          She’s gonna be Valedictorian. Talk
          about porn.

                    JONATHAN
          We’re not having this conversation.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                  10.


                    BORIS
              (resuming his recitation)
          “Marcelle stretches her tiny split
          fig, holds it open and pushes it
          down against-”

Jonathan snatches the book back from Boris and returns it to
Cairo’s desk.

                     JONATHAN
          And that is quite enough of your
          elocution.

                    BORIS
          Split fig is fucking poetry.

                    JONATHAN
          Is that coffee for me?

                    BORIS
          And a muffin too, if you want.

Jonathan takes a muffin from the pastry box. Boris goes
through Cairo’s bag.

                    JONATHAN
          Oh man, these smell -
              (he looks up)
          What are you doing?

Boris holds a university press paperback with DDC numbers on
the spine.

                     BORIS
          Welly well well, what have we here -
          Apostrophes and Ampersands, six
          gruellingly romantic short stories
          by Jonathan Albert Miller. You’ve
          got a fan.

                    JONATHAN
          She has my book?

                    BORIS
          No one else could come up with a
          title like that.
              (he looks at the library
               card in the back)
          And she’s the only one who’s ever
          checked it out. That’s sweet.

Jonathan takes this book from Boris as well and returns it to
Cairo’s desk.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                11.


                    JONATHAN
          Don’t you have a class to teach?

                    BORIS
          I’ve got an assignment up on the
          television.

                    JONATHAN
          That doesn’t count.

                    BORIS
          Carl Sagan counts.

Boris finishes his coffee and free throws it into the trash.

                    BORIS (CONT'D)
          Those muffins are fresh AF, by the
          way. Made them this morning.

                    JONATHAN
          You have time to bake but not to
          teach?

                    BORIS
          I have priorities.

Boris backs out of the room as Cairo enters. They bump into
one another.

                    CAIRO
          Excuse me, Coach Fillmore. Good
          morning.

                    BORIS
          Morning, Cairo. Later, Brofessor.

Boris mouths “split fig” behind Cairo’s back.

                    CAIRO
          Forgot my wallet.


EXT. JONATHAN’S BACKYARD - DUSK

Jonathan’s car pulls into the driveway of a modest craftsman
home. He gets out and we follow him to a small enclosed
backyard of unraked leaves. Off the side of the house is
small, white shed. Kudzu curls over the top and around the
sides in a slow, verdant smother.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                12.


INT. JONATHAN’S OFFICE/SHED - DUSK

The space is small and well appointed. Rugs cover the rough
hewn floor. Shelves of worn books stack to the ceiling.

Jonathan sets his bag on a built-in desk beneath a small
paned window - its view obscured by a veil of green tendrils.

Several vintage liquors line the windowsill. He takes a look
through them and, grinning, grabs a Pappy Van Winkle.


INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - THAT EVENING

Jonathan walks in with the bottle and a single low ball
glass. Sitting at a table is his wife BEATRICE (30s, rapier
wit, minimal empathy). She types furiously on her laptop, a
corona of Chinese food cartons spread around her.

He sits down at the table and, with a touch of ceremony,
pours himself a glass and looks up expectantly at Beatrice.
She doesn’t notice. He takes a savoring sip.

                    JONATHAN
          Are you gonna talk to me tonight or
          shall I continue contemplating my
          reflection in the back of your
          laptop?

                    BEATRICE
              (still typing)
          Sorry, I’ve been back and forth all
          day with the Nashville office who
          can’t seem to articulate what they
          want to my useless agent and think
          they can somehow articulate it to
          me, which is pretty ambitious
          considering they think articulate
          is a Danish cheese. So I’m gonna
          start scooping my fucking teeth out
          with a baby spoon, as that seems
          the most reasonable way to exorcise
          this day’s lunacy.

                    JONATHAN
          You want a massage?

                    BEATRICE
          I want a lobotomy.

She finally looks up at him. Notes the Pappy.

             Red letter day. Did Benson finally
             get computers?

He laughs.

                       JONATHAN
             It got a writer. And she’s reading
             Finnegans Wake on her own, can you
             believe that?

                       BEATRICE
             I’m forever stunned that the
             children in that backwater shanty
             can read.

                       JONATHAN
             And guess what else?

                       BEATRICE
             Infinite Jest.

                       JONATHAN
             Apostrophes and Ampersands.

He grins.

                       BEATRICE
             Look how proud you are, you’re so
             cute.

                       JONATHAN
             She checked it out of the library.

                       BEATRICE
             They carry your book at the
             library?

Her phone rings. She looks at it in dismay.

                       BEATRICE (CONT'D)
             Hark. A confederacy of dunces.

The conversation is over.

                       JONATHAN
             Deep breaths. Happy place.

                       BEATRICE
             My happy place has all of their
             heads impaled on Montblanc pens.

            Sure.

She answers the phone.

                      BEATRICE
            Hello, Amy. What is it?


INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - EVENING

We follow Jon through the hallway of his house toward the
kitchen. It’s an older home with books and art and dead
plants crammed into every available space.

He stops at a bookshelf and pulls down a well worn copy of
Apostrophes and Ampersands. He opens it to the inside cover,
where a dedication reads:

For Beatrice June Harker. Every last word.

INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

Jonathan puts some of the food cartons in the fridge and the
others in the trash. Empty bottles of beer and literary
magazines litter the counters. A record player sits on a
table with another dead plant. He turns it on. SMOKES LIKE
LIGHTNING by LIGHTNIN’ HOPKINS. His voice floats around the
room like a ghost.

He dances   himself to a cabinet filled with liquor, chooses a
bottle of   Four Roses Bourbon and pours a couple fingers into
a lowball   glass. Beatrice comes to the doorway. He holds the
partially   filled glass out to her.

                      BEATRICE
            You forgot the liquor.

                      JONATHAN
            Liquor? I don’t even know her.

He pours a bigger glass. She smiles and saunters in the room,
a drunk python.

                      JONATHAN (CONT'D)
            You ever read Under the Roofs of
            Paris?

                      BEATRICE
            Honey I had to throw my first copy
            away, it got so sticky.

          That beginning bit with the daddy
          and the prostitute and the cum
          money is filthy filthy fuego.

He hands her the filled glass and kisses her neck.

                    JONATHAN
              (reciting from memory)
          I take the first bill I find in my
          pockets, wipe my cock on it, and
          lay it crumpled on her bare belly
          weighted with a coin.

                    BEATRICE
          There it is.

                    JONATHAN
          You want to reenact?
          I can papier-mâché you with cum and
          money.

                    BEATRICE
              (laughing)
          Gross.

                    JONATHAN
          We can crack you open like a pinata
          after you dry.

He unbuttons her blouse.

                    BEATRICE
          You’re expecting a heavy load then?

                    JONATHAN
          A full body of work.
          I’m the Kandinsky of Cum.
          The Brecht of the Boom Boom.

She laughs. He picks her up in his arms and starts to slow
dance her around the room, singing along. She wraps her legs
around him and they make out in the middle of the kitchen.
Her phone rings.

                    BEATRICE
          Oh for fuck’s sake.

Jonathan sighs into her neck.

                    BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          Take care of these dishes and I’ll
          give you a handy later.

She kisses him on the nose and slides out of his arms.

              (answering)
          It’s Pushkin not Pollyfuckinanna,
          Amy. I’m not changing the ending.

She walks back to the dining room, drink in hand, blouse
unbuttoned. Jonathan adjusts himself in his trousers and
turns to the sink.


EXT. BENSON AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL - A WEEK LATER - MORNING

The sun is rising. Jonathan sits on the side of a brick
building, smoking a cigarette. Boris sits down next to him
with two coffees and a pastry box, which he opens to
Jonathan.

                    JONATHAN
          This is the best part of my
          morning.

They cheer one another with a muffin.

                    BORIS
          Winnie Black’s the best part of
          mine. I like to play drinking games
          with her outfits. Cooter shot?
          Drink. Nipple slip? Drink. It’s a
          wonder I make it through my day.

                    JONATHAN
          Without getting arrested?

                    BORIS
          Without getting blasted. But I
          guess that too.

                    JONATHAN
          Why do you always have to hold my
          coffee hostage?

                    BORIS
          Because you’re a fucking puritan
          and I feel it’s my duty to punish
          the goodness out of you.

                    JONATHAN
          You’re a sadist.

                    BORIS
          I’m a public school teacher.

They both look out at the sun rising over the vine choked
forest.

                    BORIS (CONT'D)
          Do you think there are ghosts in
          there?

                    JONATHAN
          Why don’t you go see?

                    BORIS
          I don’t go in the kudzu.

                    JONATHAN
          My granny told me to keep my
          windows shut tight so it couldn’t
          get me.

                    BORIS
          It feeds on the souls of the dead.
          That’s how it moves so fast.

                    JONATHAN
          Something about the verdancy of
          cemetery trees...

                    BORIS
          It’s a Wallflowers song.

As they watch, Cairo emerges from the forest like a wraith.
She listens to headphones.

From Cairo’s POV, Jonathan and Boris cut figures of Vladimir
and Estragon against the backdrop of the old school. She can
see their mouths moving, little puffs of air evaporating in
front of them. She approaches.

                    CAIRO
          Good morning.

                     BORIS
          Do you always walk alone through
          the woods?

                    CAIRO
          That’s a peculiar question to ask a
          young lady, Coach Fillmore.

                    BORIS
          I realize that, but do you
          actually? It’s dangerous in there.

                    CAIRO
          Not for me.
              (sotto)
          I’m a witch.

Boris squints, considering her.

                    JONATHAN
          What are you listening to?

                    CAIRO
          Celine Dion.

                       JONATHAN
          Really?

                       CAIRO
          Really.

                     BORIS
              (horrified)
          But...why?

                       CAIRO
          Why not?

                    JONATHAN
          Ignore him. He wept openly, aloud,
          to the Titanic theme song at our
          senior prom.

                    BORIS
          Do vows of secrecy mean nothing to
          you? To the grave, man!

                    CAIRO
          No judgement.

                    BORIS
          I didn’t cry.

                    JONATHAN
          You were disconsolate.

          Did I stutter?

              (impressed)
          You made these?

          Yeah, but don’t tell.

                      CAIRO
          Why not?

                      BORIS
          You know.

                      CAIRO
          I don’t.

                    BORIS

INT. BENSON AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS
LATER

Boris walks down an almost empty hall, checking his phone,
humming the Titanic theme song to himself. He walks right
past Winnie Black, standing at her open locker.

She drops a stack of books. Boris turns.

                       WINNIE
          Oops.

                    BORIS
          Oldest trick in the book, Winnie.

                    BORIS
          You’re bored.

                    WINNIE
          Ease my suffering.

Students and teachers begin to crowd the halls.

                    BORIS
          You’ll be too many tests behind.

                    WINNIE
          Don’t you tutor?

          You don’t need lessons.

                    WINNIE

                       BORIS
          You might.

Cairo watches Winnie and Boris from the shadow of a doorway.
They could be any teacher talking to any student. Boris walks
away from a blushing Winnie and Cairo goes to her.

          Whatcha doin.

                    WINNIE

A group of baseball players walks toward them in the opposite
direction. One of them whistles at Winnie.

                    JOCK
          What’s your going rate, baby girl?
          Been saving up my lunch money.

                    WINNIE
              (not missing a beat)
          Hit me up when you finish growing
          out your vagina.

The other jocks laugh at Winnie’s retort and continue on
their way. Cairo barely notices. This is old hat to her.

                    CAIRO
          You’re a lesbian.

                    WINNIE
          I’m an equal-opportunist.
          Are you jealous?

                    CAIRO
          If I say yes, will you lay off him?

                    WINNIE
          If I say yes, will you lay on me?

                    CAIRO
          You’re giving me mixed signals,

                    WINNIE
          We gotta lean in, you know? It’s
          how you build character.

They’ve come to the cafeteria.

They turn and walk inside.


INT. JONATHAN MILLER’S CLASSROOM - MORNING

Cairo sits at the front of a full classroom, listening to a
student stumble through a piece of text.

Jonathan watches her. She feels his gaze on her and turns,
coolly and openly meeting his eyes a moment before turning
back to the recitation.

Class goes on and Cairo watches Jonathan speak in front of
the class. His eyes don’t meet hers again. Winnie watches
them both.

At the end of class, he passes out graded papers. A sticky
note attached to hers reads:

See me after school?

Class lets out and she and Winnie walk out the door together.
Cairo shows her the note and then folds it into her pocket.


INT. BENSON AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL - OTHER CLASSES

We watch Cairo sitting in a series of different classrooms.

She folds the note between her fingers as she listens.


INT. JONATHAN MILLER’S CLASSROOM - END OF THE SCHOOL DAY -
AFTERNOON

Jonathan is attempting to grade papers while simultaneously
having a conversation with Boris, who sits on Cairo’s desk,
eating a power bar.

                    BORIS
          This is nasty.

He tosses the rest of the bar out the open window. From below
we hear student yell “the fuck?”

                    BORIS (CONT'D)
          How’s the book coming?

                       JONATHAN

Once alone, Jonathan sings along to himself and resumes
grading papers. He dances a little in his seat. He looks up
and immediately stops mid-lyric. Cairo stands in the doorway
watching him.

                    JONATHAN
          Hey.

She stifles a grin. He tries to be cool.

                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
          Hi. Hello. Well that’s
          embarrassing, isn’t it?

                    CAIRO
          I won’t tell.

                    JONATHAN
          Generous. Thanks for coming by, I
          hope I’m not keeping you from
          anything.

          Nah, I’m just waiting for Winnie.

Seems like you’re always waiting
for Winnie.

          CAIRO
Waiting for Winnie. Sounds like a
Gin Blossoms album.

          JONATHAN
Gin Blossoms.
What’s she doing?

          CAIRO
Applying to Vandy, you’ll be
pleased to know.

           JONATHAN
Are you?

          CAIRO
God no. Tennessee is a fucking tar
pit. No offense.

          JONATHAN
I think you’ll come to appreciate
it when you’re older.

           CAIRO
Maybe.
From afar.
As it burns.
Like Nero.

           JONATHAN
How far?

          CAIRO
Stanford far.

          JONATHAN
Because you wanna eat pot brownies
and read Joan Didion all day?

          CAIRO
Because I hear the literacy rate is
high.

          JONATHAN
Have you been to the Scroll
Sessions at Mollie Fontaine’s?

          CAIRO
What’s that?

                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
          Let’s chat about this week’s
          assignment.

                    CAIRO
          Okay.

                    JONATHAN
          I asked for a first person short
          story from a social perspective
          different than your own. Your peers
          wrote varying articles about social
          hierarchies - some attempted a
          comment on classism, Miss Black
          delivered a scathing satire on
          popularity - and you wrote about a
          reluctant spider.

They look at one another. Then he recites her work to her.
From memory.

                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
          ‘Survival and desire amalgamated
          and turned an aphotic eye inward.

                    Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)         27.

                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
          I saw my expectations dismantled
          and dismembered by those harsh and
          starving dogs of reality -
          -the truths that sit in the vacuity
          of space like a hypergiant-star,
          burning to ash all elements too
          weak to withstand the awesome heat.
          We are what we are.
          And all creatures must eat.’

                    CAIRO
          She’s not reluctant. She’s
          resigned.

                    JONATHAN
          To her death?

                    CAIRO
          To the order of things. She eats
          and also waits to be eaten.

                    JONATHAN
          Is she you?

                    CAIRO
          All fiction is confession.

                    JONATHAN
          And what does your spider confess?

                    CAIRO
          That the weak are made to be
          devoured by the strong.

                    JONATHAN
          That’s dark.

                    CAIRO
          That’s nature.

                    JONATHAN
          That’s right.

                    CAIRO
          You memorized it.

                    JONATHAN
          I’m eidetic.

She laughs.

                    JONATHAN
          It’s a good party trick.

                    CAIRO
          I’ll say.
          Spider confession?

                    JONATHAN
          I’m all ears.

                    CAIRO
          I read your book.

Beat.

                    JONATHAN
          Reviewers, of which there were
          three, found my
          work...overreaching. Ambitious
          without direction, to quote.

She thinks a moment.

                    CAIRO
          I would describe it as grand and
          tragic. Romantic horror.

She looks into his face. CU on the wrinkles of skin around
his surprised smile. He looks at her beneath his lashes.

INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - CAIRO’S BATHROOM - FLASHBACK

Cairo sits in a clawfoot bathtub filled with pillows, reading
the plastic sheathed library version of APOSTROPHE’S &
AMPERSANDS.

We look up at her from the page of the book. The text appears
projected on her face. She recites his work aloud.

                    CAIRO
          She was an electric white, noon-
          shadow moon casting cold light like
          water over the flat earth of my
          face - don’t look into the sun,
          they say, but the moon, the moon -
          I stared until I was nothing but a
          bleached bone monument beneath her,
          human ruins of a madman’s love.

                       CAIRO
             It’s the tickle boundary.

                         JONATHAN
             The what?

                       CAIRO
             Tickling is technically painful,
             but our brain tricks us into
             laughing as it tries to navigate
             the sensation of pain coming from
             someone we trust. How fucked is
             that?

                       JONATHAN
             Is that true?

                       CAIRO
             You know it is. You wrote about it.
             The horror of loving. The elation
             and the anguish.
             It’s why I wanted to take your
             class.

He stares at her, unsure what to say.

                       CAIRO (CONT'D)
             Too much? Is that weird?

He laughs.

                       JONATHAN
                 (sincere)
             I’m flattered.
             It was the first thing I’d ever
             written that felt tangible. Like
             I’d touched something.

A moment passes between them - a silent thing that smiles and
knows without question or answer.

                       CAIRO
             Is there more?

                       JONATHAN
             I haven’t written in a long time.

                         CAIRO
             Why not?

                    JONATHAN
          I don’t know. I got married.
          I started teaching. I didn’t have
          anything else to say.

                    CAIRO
          You’re uninspired.

                    JONATHAN
              (teasing)
          Are you judging me?

                    CAIRO
          No way.
          More like...challenge accepted.

                     JONATHAN
          That’s my job.
          Speaking of which -
              (beat)
          You want a jump-start on the
          midterm?

                    CAIRO
          Yes.

                    JONATHAN
          I want you to write a short story
          in the style of your favorite
          author. I think it could be the
          highlight of your portfolio
          submission to Stanford.

                    CAIRO
          I think that’s a terrific idea.

                    JONATHAN
          I hoped you would.

Winnie enters the room, dramatically dropping her bags to the
floor. She’s got a thick painter’s portfolio under her arm,
stuffed with loose canvasses. She drapes herself over a desk.

                    WINNIE
          She wants me to have four new
          pieces in OIL. Four. Do I look like
          fucking Time Lord to you?
          No. I don’t.
          My shift starts in like an hour and
          a half and mama needs some snickity
          snackities, let’s roll.

Cairo grabs her things.

                    CAIRO
          I’ll see you tomorrow, Mr. Miller.

                    JONATHAN

They leave. Jonathan smiles to himself.


INT. WINNIE’S CAR - AFTERNOON

HEARTBEATS by THE KNIFE

Winnie’s car is filled with crumpled paper, used books, and
candy wrappers. Almost every available space of the interior -
the ceiling, the doors, the console - is covered in art and
language - an ever evolving art piece by the two of them.

Cairo sits cross-legged in the passenger seat, paintbrushes
and more food wrappers beneath her.

Winnie’s car pulls into a small country gas station.

INT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

The Jock is behind the counter - not nearly as cool out of
uniform.

Winnie goes to the refrigerator and grabs a vanilla Coke,
then to the candy for a Zero bar and a bag of jerky.

She sits everything on the counter. Outside of school, Winnie
and the Jock are different with one another. Kinder.

          Can I get a pack of Marlboros?

                       JOCK

          You’re too pretty to smoke. My
          mom’s skin looks like a handbag.

                     WINNIE
          It’s for a project. I promise not
          to inhale.

counter.

She sets a ten and a five on the counter.

Beatrice, Jonathan and Boris sit at a table in the back of a
family restaurant. An empty lowball glass sits in front of
Beatrice, and various beers in front of Boris and Jonathan,
who pick at chips in a basket.

Her attitude doesn’t faze Winnie. She’s a pro.

          Winnie is. Cairo’s a nerd.

          from the Future Farmers of America.

I feel like I’m finally getting to
enjoy my job. It’s exhilarating to
be so engaged, so -

Worshipped?

I can be meaningful in the career
of a person who has something that
matters.

That’s nice, baby. I’m happy for
you.

Enjoy it while you can. Pickings
are slim in the PS system.

Rural education not as romantic as
you thought it’d be, huh?

I thought it was gonna be Friday

Legends of the Fall. But it’s just
fucking bureaucracy. Red tape and
homogenization and standardizing
that leaves us sitting around with
our dicks in our hands,
regurgitating under-funded,
outdated programs that do fuck-all
for nothing and no one while the
private schools are learning
meditation and oat rolling and
getting bonuses.

I had no idea you had so many

          You don’t have brain damage, we

INT. CAIRO’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT EVENING

The bedroom is a cavernous, Gothic wet dream. All dark blue
and green velvet, black painted hardwood floors, dripping
candles.

Cairo is staring her laptop, smoking a cigarette and ashing
into a coke can. Winnie lays on a plush king size bed eating
a popsicle. Her tongue is purple. Her work uniform is
crumpled on the floor. She’s in her underwear and an
oversized tee shirt.

                    WINNIE
          So you’re a smoker now?

                    CAIRO
          I’m smoking now. No plans for it to
          define me yet.

                    WINNIE
          You like it?

                    CAIRO
          It feels like something I never
          knew I was missing.

          What do you want to do this
          weekend? I traded all my shifts.

                    CAIRO

          with me?

          I’d rather lick a city bus tire.

          Let me dress you up.

                    CAIRO
          I don’t give a fuck about being
          hot, Winnie. I give a fuck about
          being smart.

                    WINNIE

Unqualified.

What’s the subject?

          CAIRO
What has been your greatest
adversity to date, and how have you
overcome? The only legitimate
adversity I’ve experienced was
stomaching the grainy fois gras at
Daddy’s forty-fifth birthday.

          WINNIE
Don’t diminish it, your life is
rife with adversity! Awesome absent
parents and being an only child
holed up in your mansion with your
books and all. A hard knock life,
indeed.

          CAIRO
I imagine it’s about as hard as it
is for you to wake up every morning
looking like Fuck-Me Barbie.

          WINNIE
It’s not that hard.

          CAIRO
But it is. I have no interest in
getting legacied into Yale and I’m
sure as fuck not going to a state
school and for double fuck not in
this state. Which means I have to
get in on my merit. But is a 4.2
GPA enough? Fuck to the no. Because
we’re like, so super fortunate to
grow up in a post 90’s politically
correct clusterfuck, where hard
work isn’t the winning ticket -

You really want Coach Fillmore to
swipe your V card? He’s like twenty
years older than you.

He’s only fourteen years older than
me and so what? Older men have been
harvesting virginity since the dawn
of time.

So it doesn’t mean anything to you?

What?

Your virginity.

EXT. MOLLIE FONTAINE’S - DAY

The sky is bruise purple and fat with unlet rain. Cairo walks
toward a large, gilded Victorian house. A sign out front says
SCROLL SESSIONS: 2:00 PM.

She walks up the front steps and into the house.


INT. MOLLIE FONTAINE’S - DAY

Stained glass windows kaleidoscope a wide foyer aswarm with
hipsters and academics. A long table is set with wine and
snacks. Cairo walks over to it and takes a glass of red.

A woman in a calico dress speaks to the group. This is
SUZETTE (30s).

The room politely giggles.


INT. MOLLIE FONTAINE’S - PARLOR - DAY

Cairo moves into the parlor before anyone else and snags a
low velvet loveseat in the back. A podium is set before a
large fireplace and various chairs are smattered about the
room. A baby grand is positioned in front of a bay window.
Taper candles illuminate the room.

And it begins to rain.

People enter and take their seats. They all clearly know one
another and Cairo observes their casual intimacy with casual
detachment. She feels a presence behind her. A beautiful
mouth leans to her ear and whispers.

                    JONATHAN (O.C.)
          Her Majesty has ventured among the
          people.

She turns to the familiar sound. Jonathan squats behind the
couch, his face close to hers. His hair is wet. He smiles at
her, all warmth and satisfaction glowing all over her.

          May I sit?

She nods. He does. They are close on the small couch. A few
people in front of them say hello to him.

                    CAIRO
          Do you know all of these people?

                    JONATHAN

          Is she a writer?

                    JONATHAN

The room falls silent. Suzette plays NOCTURNE NO. 2 in C
MINOR by JOHN FIELD.

Over the song, Cairo and Jonathan watch as various people
approach the podium to speak.

Both are visibly moved by whatever it is they’re hearing.
Jonathan watches her...his eyes trace her eyelashes, her
nose, the curve of her lips and neck.
She turns to him then, eyes shining with emotion.
They stare at one another the way one does a painting in a
museum that resembles them - with the wonder of how someone
knew their face three hundred years ago.

The room erupts in applause and everyone stands but them.

They are only what they are, there, on a couch together in a
Victorian house in Tennessee.
Two little ghosts in recognition.


INT. MOLLIE FONTAINE’S - PORCH - DAY

Heavy rain creates a cocoon of white noise. Jonathan and
Cairo stand alone in a screened porch. They each have a glass
of wine. They each are a little buzzed.

          I concede.
          That was really something.

Jonathan laughs, delighted.

                    JONATHAN
          You’re just saying that so I don’t
          tell on you for drinkin’ and
          smokin’ and cussin’.

                    CAIRO
          I say only what I mean.

They look at each other. Thunder crashes. Cairo turns to look
out at the rain. Smoke haloes around her.


INT. BENSON HIGH SCHOOL - OUTSIDE - FRIDAY MORNING

Jonathan and Boris sit in their usual location. Jonathan
smokes a cigarette. The sun is rising.

                    JONATHAN
          It’s not that cold. Don’t be such a
          puss.

                    BORIS
          I can see my breath.

                    JONATHAN
          Then go inside.

                    BORIS
          And miss Godot?

                    JONATHAN
          Soon’t yourself.

                    BORIS
          Did you just say ‘soon’t’?

                    JONATHAN
          How do you say it?

                    BORIS
          Suit. I say suit. Because one would
          suit oneself, not soon’t, whatever
          the hell that is.

                    JONATHAN
          That’s what I said. Shut up.

INT. WINNIE’S CAR - MORNING

Cairo sits in the passenger seat, holding a tray of three
coffees in her lap. Her hair is down, her make up is done.
She looks...adult.

                    WINNIE
              (admiring)
          How do you feel?

Cairo takes a deep breath.

                     CAIRO
          Visible.

                    WINNIE
          Ain’t no use in keepin’ that light
          under a bushel.
          Now get out of my car so I can
          watch’at ass walk away.

Cairo grins and gets out. Winnie rolls down her window to cat
call her.

                    WINNIE (CONT'D)
              (singing)
          Tryna get to yoooooou and dat booty-


EXT. BENSON HIGH SCHOOL - OUTSIDE - MORNING

Cairo rounds the corner of the building.

                    CAIRO
          Gifts for the wallflowers.

She offers them the tray.

                    BORIS
          What’s this?

                    CAIRO
          It’s coffee.

                    BORIS
          No, no. What is this I see before
          me? You look like a girl.

                    CAIRO
              (cheeky)
          Like a big girl?

                    BORIS
          Yes ma’am, you clean up good. Got a
          big date?

                       CAIRO
          Nope.

                    BORIS
          Presentation in class?

                       CAIRO
          Nope.

                       BORIS
          Get laid?

                       JONATHAN
          OKAY.

                       BORIS
          I like it.

                    JONATHAN
              (re: coffee)
          Thank you for this. It’s very
          generous.

                    CAIRO
          No one should have to suffer
          cafeteria coffee.

                    BORIS
          Muffin, muffin?

Boris opens a white pastry box to her.

                    CAIRO
          Oh my God, these smell incredible.
          What flavor?

                       BORIS
          Split fig.

Jonathan chokes on his coffee. Cairo stifles a grin.

                    CAIRO
          You should get a logo and sell
          these to raise money for the team.
              (Boris laughs)
          Don’t you laugh! You’d buy some,
          wouldn’t you Mr. Miller?

                    JONATHAN
          I can’t resist a cute boy with a
          muffin.

                    CAIRO
          Winnie could design it for you, you
          know. She’s great at that stuff.
              (inspired beat)
          Coach.
          You could call yourself the Muffin
          Man.

                      JONATHAN
          Nice.

                    CAIRO
          Winnie and I could help you get it
          off the ground.

                    BORIS
          What’s in it for you?

                    CAIRO
          Work experience on our college
          apps.

                    BORIS
          Would you really buy my muffins?

                    JONATHAN
          Why pay for what I already get for
          free?

                    CAIRO
          I would. All the girls would.

He thinks a moment.

                    BORIS
          I’m the Muffin Man.

                    CAIRO
          Once more with pride!

                    BORIS
          I’m the motherfucking Muffin Man!

She throws up a hand for a high-five and he returns it.

                    CAIRO
          Go live your dreams, Coach.

                    BORIS
          Good goddamn you’re smart.

Cairo shrugs and smiles. Boris jumps up and down a little in
the cold.

                    BORIS (CONT'D)
          It’s colder’n wearin’ a brass bra
          on the shady side of an iceberg out
          here. Y’all coming in?

                    JONATHAN
          Nah, I’m gonna have one more. You
          go ahead.

                    BORIS
          Soon’t yourself, Brohan.
              (to Cairo)
          Thanks again. For the all the pick-
          me-ups you brought this morning.

Boris leaves.

                    JONATHAN
          You’re sweet.

                    CAIRO
          When it suits.

Jonathan opens his pack of Camels to her. She opens her pack
to him.

                    CAIRO (CONT'D)
          Set higher standards, Mr. Miller.
          Have a menthol.


INT. BENSON HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER

Jonathan is exiting the teacher’s lounge with a sludgy cup of
coffee when his phone dings with a text from Beatrice:

B: Weekend getaway? xxx

His face registers happy surprise. He responds:

J: For real?

B: Amy’s been fucking me long enough. Your turn. Hurry home.

Jon is interrupted by the sound of high heels approaching. He
looks up to see JOYCE MANNER, VICE PRINCIPAL (sharp, 50s).

                    JOYCE
          Texting in the halls is a
          punishable offense, Mr. Miller.

                    JONATHAN
          Oh excuse me, Vice Principal
          Manner.

                    JOYCE
          I hope it was worth it.

He blushes.

                    JOYCE (CONT'D)
          It was. I won’t tell the Principal.

                    JONATHAN
          How’re you settling into the new
          gig? Better than 10th grade
          English?

                    JOYCE
          I only get to talk to people who
          are in trouble. I think this job
          may have been a lateral move.

                    JONATHAN
          Bummer. Well you look great.

                    JOYCE
          Thanks, I bathe in the blood of
          underachievers. How’s the magical
          world of an elective class? Must be
          charming what with your kids
          choosing to take your course and
          all.

                    JONATHAN
          Yeah, it’s strong this year.

                    JOYCE
          Your student reviews were
          outstanding. Are you giving them
          weed?

                    JONATHAN
          Say nope to dope, Joyce.

                    JOYCE
          I say a friend with weed is a
          friend indeed.

                    JONATHAN
          Do you?

                    JOYCE
          No. But I like that it rhymes.

          You’re streaming a movie, aren’t

INT. BENSON AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - THAT
AFTERNOON

School has let out and kids are shouting in the hallways,
ready for the weekend. Cairo is putting books away in her
locker. Winnie stands next to her, playing on her phone.

                    WINNIE
          What did he say?

                    CAIRO
              (smiling)
          He didn’t have to say anything.

The baseball player entourage walks past the girls. The JOCK
smiles at Winnie.

                    JOCK
          Coming to the game, ladies? I’ll
          let you hold my bat.

                    WINNIE
          If I wanted to hold a tampon, I’d
          just pull it out of your pussy.

                    JOCK
          Fuck you, Winnie.

                    WINNIE
          Omigod, your whole vocabulary in
          one sentence! Come fuck me with
          that big nasty rhetoric, jock-twat.
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                54.


Winnie humps the air. The JOCK flips her off and continues on
his way.

                       WINNIE (CONT'D)
          You ready?

                    CAIRO
          I’ve got to run by Mr. Miller’s
          room first.

                    WINNIE
          Can I watch?

Cairo shuts her locker.

                    CAIRO
          With pleasure.


INT. JONATHAN MILLER’S CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

Winnie is on her phone by the door, keeping a watchful eye on
the scene. Cairo enters the room. Jonathan packs his bag and
shuts down his computer. He’s happy to see her, but hurried.

                    JONATHAN
          Hey, kid. How are you?

She sets her things on her desk.

                    CAIRO
          Hey.
          You in a hurry?

                    JONATHAN
          Headed on a little weekend vacation
          with my wife.

                    CAIRO
          What do writers do on vacation?

                    JONATHAN
          Pretend to write in a different
          location, I guess.

Winnie’s in the door. It’s a dance for them to be alone
together.

                    CAIRO
          Can we talk about the midterm?

                    JONATHAN
          Of course. What’s on your mind?
                      Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)               55.


He has all of his things in order. He comes around and sets
his stuff on Cairo’s desk. They stand close.

                    CAIRO
          I want your approval on my author
          before I start.

                    JONATHAN
          Okay, who is it?

                    CAIRO
          Henry Miller.

                    JONATHAN
          Provocative.

                    CAIRO
          I can justify him.

                    JONATHAN
          His structure is challenging to
          emulate.

                    CAIRO
          It’s not just structural though,
          it’s everything - his decadence,
          his total disregard for literary
          etiquette, his destruction of
          convention. You know. The good
          stuff.

He raises an eyebrow at her.

                    CAIRO (CONT'D)
          You don’t think I can do it.

                      JONATHAN
          Miller is   public enemy no. 1 to the
          censors -   he’s top of the list we
          discussed   at the start of the
          semester.   He’s controversial.

                    CAIRO
          Yeah, and I’m applying to Stanford.
          If it’s not controversial, it’s not
          interesting.

                      JONATHAN
          Okay.

                      CAIRO
          Okay yes?
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                   56.


                    JONATHAN
          I trust you.

A moment of suspension passes between them - Cairo smiles and
he returns it a moment before remembering himself. He gathers
his stuff.

                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
          I gotta go.

                    CAIRO
          I know.

                    JONATHAN
          Try and do something fun this
          weekend, okay? Take a recess.

                    CAIRO
          I’ll rest if you write.

He walks to the door, then stops. Winnie is still on the
phone.

                    JONATHAN
          I’ll see you Monday. Bye Winnie.

He exits. Winnie drops her phone (that she wasn’t even on)
and runs over to Cairo.

                    WINNIE
          But like...omigod. Y’all are...on.

                    CAIRO
          Don’t be gross.

Winnie hikes up her skirt and bends over Jonathan’s desk
suggestively.

                    WINNIE
          Oh Mr. Miller...I just love the
          decadence and the words and
          breaking all the rules.

She throws herself on the desk like a naughty school girl.
Boris comes to the door but they don’t see him.

                    CAIRO
          I didn’t say it like that.

                    WINNIE
          You thought it like that.
              (Cairo rolls her eyes)
          We make a good double-team-team,
          huh? Seduction game ON POINT.
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)              57.


                    CAIRO
          I am not trying to seduce Mr.
          Miller. I’m trying to get into
          college.

                    BORIS
          Am I interrupting?

Winnie slowly gets off the desk and pulls down her skirt. The
action is not lost on Boris.

                    CAIRO
          We were just leaving.

                    BORIS
          Cairo - I think your idea is whiz-
          bang. And I’d love your help too,
          Winnie.

                       WINNIE
          With what?

                    BORIS
          Can you keep a secret?

                    WINNIE
          Sure can’t.

Beat.

                    BORIS
          I bake muffins.

                    CAIRO
          And he’s going to have the baseball
          team sell them to raise money and
          they’re going to call themselves
          the Muffin Men and he wants you to
          design the logo.

Winnie takes a moment.

                    WINNIE
          I think that’s really cool.

                    BORIS
              (surprised)
          You do?

                    WINNIE
          It’s fun to be good at something.
          I’d love to help.

              (grinning)
          Cool. Well. I guess I’ll call you
          girls out on your lunch and we can
          go over the specs-

                    WINNIE
          Here. Give me your phone and I’ll
          put myself in. It’ll be a lot
          faster if I can just text you
          ideas.

He hands Winnie his phone. Cairo digs through her bag looking
for her own.

                    BORIS
          Great. Thank you.

                    CAIRO
          Can you call me?

Winnie punches on his phone.

                    WINNIE
          And now you’ll have Cairo’s number
          as well.
              (she listens a moment)
          It’s going to voicemail.

                       CAIRO
          Shit.

Winnie hangs up and stuffs Boris’s phone in her bra.

                    WINNIE
          Whatever, I’m sure it’s in the
          bottom of your bag.

                    CAIRO
          I just had it a minute ago.

                    WINNIE
          It’s Friday and we’re still here.
          Let’s a-fucking go.

She starts to haul Cairo out of the room.

                    BORIS
          Uh, Winnie?

                       WINNIE
          Uh, Boris.
                         Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)               59.


                         BORIS
             My phone?

                         WINNIE
             My phone?

                       BORIS
             Your phone?

                       WINNIE
             Your phone? Your phone.

She pulls his phone from her bra.

                       WINNIE (CONT'D)
             Right. Sorry.

She hands it to him and it shocks him.

                       WINNIE (CONT'D)
             Danger danger high voltage.

He smirks.

                       BORIS
             See you later girls.

Winnie and Cairo leave, arm in arm. Once out of ear shot:

                       CAIRO
             You’re unbelievable.

                       WINNIE
             I’m practically a professional.


INT.   JONATHAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

Suitcases are packed and ready to go by the back door.
Jonathan reads ON WRITING by STEPHEN KING. Beatrice is on her
phone.

                       BEATRICE
                 (On the phone)
             Yeah, I fucking know.
                 (to Jon)
             I’m sorry, just a few more minutes.

                       JONATHAN
             We were supposed to leave forty
             minutes ago.

Beatrice walks away. Jonathan goes back to his book.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                 60.


The intro to POPPIN MY COLLAR by THREE 6 MAFIA emanates from
his bag. He stares at it. It stops. It starts again.
Jonathan sticks his hand inside and retrieves a cell phone.

                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
              (answering)
          Hello?

INTERCUT between CAIRO’S HOUSE and JONATHAN’S KITCHEN.

Cairo sits outside on a terrace overgrown with ivy and
covered in leaves. A stack of books sit in front of her on a
wrought iron table, where she has her feet propped. She talks
on a house phone.

                    CAIRO
          Hi. You have my phone.

                    JONATHAN
          And whose phone do I have?

                    CAIRO
          Cairo Sweet’s.

                    JONATHAN
          Cairo.
          It’s Jonath-, Mr. Miller.

                    CAIRO
          Sticky Fingers Miller.

                    JONATHAN
          How are you?

                    CAIRO
          Tethered to a landline.
          Are you already gone?

                    JONATHAN
          I should be.

Beatrice enters to pour herself another drink.

                    BEATRICE
          I don’t give a flying backwards
          fuck, Amy. Give them the first
          draft, they’ll think it’s new.

Jon waves at Bea to get her attention.

                    JONATHAN
          I need to drop something off at a
          student’s house.
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)              61.


                    BEATRICE
          Great. Take care of it.

Beatrice pours four fingers of bourbon neat.

                    BEATRICE (CONT'D)
              (to Amy)
          It’s not enough, Amy.

A dark, shining beetle crawls across Cairo’s foot.

                     BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          Can you grab me some tampons,
          please? The organic ones if you can
          find them.
              (to Amy)
          Not you, Amy, obviously. Get me a
          better deal and you can plug my
          pussy.

The beetle makes its way up Cairo’s leg.

                    JONATHAN
          You big-time, road-head owe me.

Cairo looks up. Silver maples above her are turning their
leaves up to the promising rain.


                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
          Sorry, honey. You still there?

                    CAIRO
          Still here.

                    JONATHAN
          You live over in Lovell Hills,
          right?

                    CAIRO
          How did you remember that?

                    JONATHAN
          Eidetic, remember?

                       CAIRO
          Show-off.

                       JONATHAN
          And Mensa.

                       CAIRO
          Shut up.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                   62.


                    JONATHAN
          My mom is really proud.

Jonathan watches Beatrice down her entire glass of bourbon in
one go.

                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
          What’s your address? I’ll come drop
          it off before we leave, if that’s
          okay.

The wind picks up. Cairo’s long hair moves around her like a
curtain.


EXT. LOVELL HILLS - AFTERNOON

LOVER YOU SHOULD HAVE COME OVER by JEFF BUCKLEY

Thick dark clouds hang low over the horizon.

We pass massive estates on rolling acres. The houses are
separated by thick groves of oak and magnolia.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          400 Huxley. Might be hard to see
          for the trees, but it’s there.

                    JONATHAN (V.O.)
          I’ll see you soon.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          Hurry. It’s gonna rain.


INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

Cairo walks toward us down a dark, vast hallway of windows.


EXT. LOVELL HILLS - AFTERNOON

Jonathan drives toward us, one arm out the window. The
reflection of the storm on the windshield obscures our view
of him.


EXT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - THE TERRACE - AFTERNOON

Thunder rolls. Rain drops smack against the books on the
table. On top, is APOSTROPHES AND AMPERSANDS.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                   63.


INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - LOWER GALLERY - AFTERNOON

We follow Cairo past enormous original Egon Schiele
paintings. Her face is luminous. Not smiling exactly, but
bright.


INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - STAIRWELL - AFTERNOON

Her fingers trail up the bannister. Her bare feet pad on the
steps. Up and up she goes, past hallways of countless rooms.


INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

We follow her into her bedroom, then into her bathroom.


INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - BATHROOM

Smooth walls into soaring ceilings. Clawfoot bathtub.
Cathedral windows. She looks at herself in the mirror. Rain
shadows streak down her face. She puts a little perfume
behind her ears. Finger brushes through her hair.


EXT. CAIRO’S DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON

Jonathan’s car moves through the overgrown trees.

As he comes upon it, we see Cairo’s house in full.


INT. JONATHAN’S CAR - AFTERNOON

Jonathan sits in the driveway, idling his car. He turns
Cairo’s phone over in his hand.

He looks up at her house. The view is blurred by rain.

Her ghost stands at a second story window. Then it moves
away.

He opens the car door.


INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - PORCH - AFTERNOON

Cairo opens the front door. The house is dark and vast behind
her.

Jonathan stands in the rain.
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                 64.


A long moment passes between them - the curtain of rain the
only thing separating them.

                       CAIRO
          Come here.

Jonathan makes a decision.

                    JONATHAN
          No. You come here.

Without hesitation, Cairo steps off the porch into the rain.

BLACK.


INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Beatrice types at lightning speed on her laptop. She is
surrounded by paper. A bourbon rocks sweats in a glass next
to her.

Jonathan is across from her, also on his laptop. CU on the
screen - a blank word document with a blinking cursor. He
stares at it. His beautiful hands hover above the keys.

                                                   FLASH TO:


EXT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - EARLIER THAT AFTERNOON

Slow motion rain waterfalls off the second story porch.
Behind the water - a white form, a ghost.


INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Jonathan looks up. Beatrice is staring daggers into him.

                       JONATHAN
          What?

                    BEATRICE
          What are you doing?

                    JONATHAN
          I’m working.

                       BEATRICE
          On what?

                    JONATHAN
          I don’t know yet.
                        Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)             65.


Beatrice pinches her nose between her fingers.

                    BEATRICE
          Baby...I know we were supposed to
          have this weekend together and I’m
          sorry that my team is the fucking
          tasteless worst and I promise to
          fire them the moment this gets to
          press, but I can’t work like this.

                       JONATHAN
          Like what?

                    BEATRICE
          I can’t work with you sitting there
          across from me sucking all the
          inspiration out of the room. I can
          feel you trying to conjure it from
          the air and it’s fucking my flow.

He blinks at her.

                    JONATHAN
          Are you serious?

                    BEATRICE
              (dead serious)
          Please go away.

He shuts his computer and gets up.

                     BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          Thank you.
          I’ll be nicer when it’s over.

                    JONATHAN
          I’ll be outside.

                    BEATRICE
          You gonna cut down that kudzu
          before it eats our home?

                    JONATHAN
          I think it’s pretty.

She looks at him a moment before returning to her laptop. He
leaves.


EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

Jonathan walks across the yard. A curtain of kudzu has grown
across the door to his shed. He maneuvers under it to get
inside. He doesn’t close the door behind him.
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)               66.


INT. JONATHAN’S OFFICE/SHED - NIGHT

Jonathan sits at his desk, pulls down a bottle of bourbon and
pours himself a tall glass. Wet night sounds whisper through
the open door.

He looks at the blank document on his laptop.

He closes his eyes.

                                                FLASH TO:


EXT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - EALIER

The rain slows and the ghost is revealed. Cairo looks
different in his memory - still and shining, a penny wish in
a fountain.


INT. JONATHAN’S OFFICE/SHED - NIGHT

He opens his eyes.

Leaves crowd the window, hundreds of little peeping toms. A
single vine has broken through the rotted wood of the sill.
He reaches out a hand to touch it - thinks better of it, and
pulls his hand away. He leans back in his chair.

                                                FLASH TO:


EXT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - EARLIER

Jonathan looks at Cairo.
She looks amused. She looks at his mouth.

                       CAIRO
          Come here.

The sound of rain turns to white noise.

                    JONATHAN
          No.
          You come here.

We see them in profile. A suspended moment of her in the dry
space and him in the wet.

Then she crosses that barrier.

She moves into the rain. Her hands reach for his face.
Her lips press to his mouth.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                   67.


He gives, just a little. Just enough.
She slides her tongue inside him.

He closes his eyes. She doesn’t.


INT. JONATHAN’S OFFICE/SHED - NIGHT

DING.

A chime pulls Jonathan from the memory.

NEW MAIL.

He reduces the document. His email is behind it - amid
various promotions is a new message from
SALTYSWEET@GMAIL.COM.

He smiles.

The subject title: FOR JONATHAN, LOVE CAIRO

He opens it.


EXT. JONATHAN’S OFFICE/SHED - NIGHT

Gold light within illuminates the little room, turning it
bottle glass green against the vines. A jewel box in the
overgrown yard.

It begins to rain.

BLACK.


EXT. THE WOODS - THE FOLLOWING MONDAY - MORNING

ADAGIO FOR STRINGS AND ORGAN IN G MINOR - RESPIGHI (SUITE
III/ BOCCHERINI: QUINTETTINO)

Cairo looks like Jonathan’s dream version of her, only all in
black. Her hair is done. She wears makeup.

She walks alone through the misty woods. A pink dawn glows
above her.

We follow her through the trees to the back of the school...


EXT. BENSON AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

Cairo breaks through the tree line. We follow her to the
school, into...
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                68.


INT. JONATHAN MILLER’S CLASSROOM - MORNING

...Jonathan’s room. It’s empty and dark. The clock ticks.

She goes around the room turning on the lamps and then over
to the window to watch the sun rise through the trees.

Eventually, Jonathan enters and freezes. They stare at one
another in the reflection of the window a moment before she
turns to him, smiling.

                    CAIRO
          Good morning.

He walks to his desk and sits without saying hello. He pulls
a stack of papers from his bag. She watches him but says
nothing. He’s got his hand on her short story.

                    CAIRO (CONT'D)
          Are you okay?

He starts to say something. Stops. Reconsiders.

                    CAIRO (CONT'D)
          What’s wrong?

He looks like he’s bracing for impact.

                    JONATHAN
          Your story.

                    CAIRO
          Oh.
          You didn’t like it?

                    JONATHAN
          You need to choose another author.

                    CAIRO
          Why?

                    JONATHAN
          This is inappropriate.

She repeats the word back to him as though she’s never heard
it.

                    CAIRO
          Inappropriate.
          What do you mean?

                    JONATHAN
          Why did you write this?
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)        69.


                    CAIRO
          You asked me to.

                    JONATHAN
          Why did you choose this content?

                    CAIRO
          You said to write what you know.

                    JONATHAN
          This is what you know?

                    CAIRO
          This is. Us.

Beat.

                    JONATHAN
          No Cairo, this is you.
          I can’t...understand it.

She stares at him a moment.

                    CAIRO
          It’s about two like-people
          abnegating social convention. It’s
          a comment on the sexual
          anesthetization of a culture super-
          saturated with pornography. It’s
          about the inefficacy of said
          culture’s romantic dogmas on young
          people’s expectations.
          It’s about inexorable attraction.
          It’s layered.

                    JONATHAN
          You deliberately misinterpreted the
          assignment.

                    CAIRO
          I was clear about how I intended to
          write it.

                    JONATHAN
          This is pornography.

                    CAIRO
          Yes.

                     JONATHAN
          So then put it in your diary and
          not on my fucking desk.
              (beat)

                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)      70.

                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
          Write a new story with a new
          author. I won’t indulge this.

                    CAIRO
          The story or us?

                       JONATHAN
          Both.

His mouth is sticky.

                    CAIRO
          But you already have. You inspired
          it.

                    JONATHAN
          I can’t accept it.

                    CAIRO
          Can’t or won’t? Because it sounds
          like you’re scared. And it looks
          like you’re measuring. Stop talking
          to me like a stranger and say what
          you mean.

                    JONATHAN
          What did you expect me to do with

          I assure you I am.

                       CAIRO
          Why?

                    JONATHAN
          You know why.

                    CAIRO
          Tell me. Say it.

          have to fail you for the midterm.

                    CAIRO
          Tell me why.

                    JONATHAN
          I don’t have to tell you anything.

                    CAIRO
          You’re afraid, aren’t you? It made
          you feel something that scared you.

                    JONATHAN
          Don’t put words in my mouth.

                    CAIRO
          Then say them yourself. Tell me
          what it made you feel.

                    JONATHAN
          Incredibly foolish for having
          trusted this material to a child.

                    CAIRO
          A child. And what was I before you
          read it?

                    JONATHAN
          My student.

                    CAIRO
          You’re lying.

                    JONATHAN
          We’re done here.

                    CAIRO
          Did it get too real for you? You
          built the world, you built the
          fantasy but it wasn’t on the page
          it was in real life and now that it
          has flesh you can’t bear the weight
          of it.

                    JONATHAN
          This conversation is over.

                    CAIRO
          You can’t blur the lines and expect
          me to see a boundary when I
          suddenly cross it.

Beat. They stare at each other.

                    JONATHAN
          Let me be very, very clear with
          you; You are my student and I am
          your teacher and that is all. Any
          misconceptions of that are,
          regrettably, something you shoulder
          alone.

Cairo’s face shifts backwards on her skull.

                    CAIRO
          Write what you know, is what you
          said.

                    JONATHAN
          I know what I said.

                    CAIRO
          You don’t know anything you say.
              (beat. Then, slowly)
          This is good. You know it is. So
          let’s examine the real issue, which
          is not my writing, but yours.

                       JONATHAN
          Excuse me?

                    CAIRO
          You thought you were gonna be hot
          shit, didn’t you? You thought you
          were gonna be somebody, didn’t you?
          “Overreaching without ambition.”
          Do you know what that means?
          It means you weren’t brave enough
          to be better.
          It means you’re deliberately
          impotent.
          It means you are mediocre.
          You wanna fail me?
          I fucking dare you.
          But you better make it mean
          something to you and you better
          know what it means because the cost
          is high, Mr. Miller. And if you’re
          not very, very careful...this
          banality, this falsity you wallow
          in will devour you until you are as
          small as you pretend to be. And
          then you will disappear and no one
          will give any more thought to you
          than they do an unread cookie
          fortune.

          those who believed you’d be more.
              (venomous)
          No wonder you’re a public school
          teacher.

She leaves. He watches her go.

He is still. So still as to be inanimate.

Then he stands and turns to the chalkboard. He raises the
chalk, makes a short stroke - then presses his forehead to
the board. Anguish shatters his face.

His arm drops and the chalk streaks against it like the trail
of a falling star.


EXT. BENSON HIGH SCHOOL - OUTSIDE - MORNING

Sleepy students are starting to arrive. Cairo walks through
an outside corridor, into the parking lot and out into the
field behind the school, where she disappears back into the
choked trees.


INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT EVENING

Jonathan enters, exhausted.

Beatrice is cross-legged on the couch, all of her electronics
lit up in a corona around her. She wears pair high waisted
knickers and a tee shirt. A sweating glass of bourbon rests
between her legs. She looks up at him and smiles, buzzed.

He sets his bag down and slumps in a chair next to the couch.
A large window is behind him.

                     BEATRICE
          How you doing over there,
          Professor?

                    JONATHAN
          I’ve had a very bad day.

                    BEATRICE
          You want a drink?

She hands him her bourbon. He drinks it in one go.

                     BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          They make you plough a field or
          something?
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                74.


                    JONATHAN
          I had a very unpleasant
          conversation with a student about
          the midterm assignment.

                    BEATRICE
          Juicy. More info.

                    JONATHAN
          Don’t make fun of me.

                     BEATRICE
          I’m not.
              (off his look)
          I’ve been a cave troll for weeks -
          I long for experiences of the
          outside world. Tell me.
              (beat)
          Oh. Was it with her?
              (teasing)
          Your acolyte?

He looks at her. She can see he’s torn up about it.

                    BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          What happened?

                    JONATHAN
          She drafted something that makes
          Henry Miller look like Dr. Seuss.

                    BEATRICE
          You let a teenager run with Miller
          and you’re surprised it was vulgar?

                    JONATHAN
          She was supposed to use his
          literary technique not his subject
          matter.

                    BEATRICE
          Go on.

She unfolds her legs and moves closer to him. Her cheeks are
liquor flushed. She engages fully.

                    BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          What’s the subject matter?

He’s reluctant. She’s expectant.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                75.


                    JONATHAN
          An English teacher and a student
          who have an illicit affair,
          complete with pre-cum and cherry
          popping. Those words exactly.

                    BEATRICE
          Show me right now.

Jonathan considers her - skeptical of her interest and
starving for her attention. She crawls over the couch and
onto his lap, surprising him.

                    BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          I wanna know what shocked you.

He reaches into his bag and retrieves the story. Hands it to
her. She reads it right there in his lap, in his face.

                    BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          For Jonathan, Love Cairo.
          Oh baby, it’s a love letter.

                    JONATHAN
          It’s pornography.

                    BEATRICE
          Shh. No disclaimers.

She settles herself into his lap.

Jonathan looks over his wife as she reads. Her breasts
beneath her shirt. The way her eyes shimmer over the words.
His hands rest on her thighs. She moves forward on him, in
approval.

She smiles. Then she laughs. She’s enthralled. The quoted
text appears on the screen as she recites.

                     BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          “Alice sat back against the soft
          down of her pillows, her sex split
          and sore, and imagined herself as a
          pitted peach, with bruised and open
          flesh. The sanguine testament of
          her virginity lay heavy like an oil
          slick in the cream lace of her
          Tuesdays.”

Beatrice looks at him like this is the cleverest punchline
she’s ever heard.

          Her Tuesdays. Like her Tuesday
          panties.

                    JONATHAN
          Yes.

She whistles.

                    BEATRICE
          She’s got it bad.

She sets down the pages, looks into his eyes.

                    BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          Tell me what else happens.

                    JONATHAN
          You can read it right there.

                    BEATRICE
          No. You tell me.
          Because I know you remember it word
          for word and I want you to do the
          thing. Tell me how she describes
          you.

She moves against him again. Encouraging him. His hands slide
over her skin. She looks down at him through heavy lids as he
speaks.

                    JONATHAN
              (reciting from memory)
          ”Mr. Murphy, tall and carelessly
          attractive, kept his thoughts to
          himself and his blue eyes at half-
          mast. One might assume his drowsy
          appearance to be symptom of a vague
          institutional ennui, but Alice saw
          it mostly to hide the shock of
          indecency he felt when he lay his
          eyes on the young unripened bodies
          of his female students.

Beatrice slowly presses herself into him until he is
practically saying the words into her mouth.

                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
          He licked his chapped lips,
          imagining his tongue instead
          sliding into the cleft between each
          of their legs. Imagining himself as
          the first. As the standard.

          None were exempt from his salacious
          reveries. All cunts were created
          equal and magnificent in his mind.”

                      BEATRICE
          Are they?

She grinds against him.

                    BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          Or are some cunts remarkable?

He resists her. Torturing himself.

                    JONATHAN
              (half-hearted)
          Stop.

She doesn’t. She intensifies. He’s losing focus.

                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
          You’re drunk.

                    BEATRICE
          I’m indecent.

He pulls her tight against him. They grind into one another.
They breathe together. He slips his hand inside her panties
and she sucks in a breath of air.

Through the window behind Jonathan, a pair of headlights
illuminate the yard.

She gasps again and cums against his fingers - she arches
back and issues a hearty laughs.

She kisses him. Reaches a hand to his cock and gives it a
squeeze. Then she leans into his ear.

                    BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          We’ve got company.

He looks at her with anguish. The front door bangs open.

                    BORIS (O.C.)
          Y’all shouldn’t leave the damn door
          unlocked.

Beatrice dismounts her husband and grins at him before
walking into the foyer, just as she is. Shameless.

INT. CAIRO’S BEDROOM - THAT EVENING

Cairo and Winnie sit on Cairo’s bed, passing back and forth
an expensive bottle of vodka.

                    WINNIE
          What, so he was offended?

                    CAIRO

                    WINNIE
          You still into him?

                    CAIRO
          NO. Are you kidding? He’s a
          pretender. At least with Boris what
          you see is what you get. Jonathan

DING. B_FILL: What does that entail?

They share a look.

          Take off your shirt.

Cairo hops off the bed and walks to her wardrobe.

Cairo undresses in front of Winnie. She puts on a lace bra
and takes her hair down.

Cairo gets back on the bed and faces Winnie.

Cairo sets the phone to face them, framing them in the shot.

They kiss. Soft at first, then more urgent. Cairo snaps the
picture and a flash bleaches them in white light.

The kiss doesn’t end with the flash. Winnie’s hands are on
Cairo’s back, in her hair. Cairo bites Winnie’s lip. Hard
enough to force her to pull away.

They stare at one another a moment. Cairo hands Winnie the
phone.

                       CAIRO (CONT'D)
            Send it.

                      WINNIE
            What do I say?

                      CAIRO
            Nothing. Just send it.

She does.

                                                FLASH TO:

Earlier that day: Cairo walks through students like a ghost,
making her way to her locker.

                      WINNIE
            Are you gonna text Jonathan?

                       CAIRO
            No.

                      WINNIE
            You have his number don’t you?

                                                FLASH TO:

She grabs her things, among them an UNLABELED MANILA FOLDER,
into which she stuffs a copy of her essay.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          All warfare is based on deception.
          Move your enemy but don’t be moved

                                                FLASH TO:

Cairo drops the essay into an INBOX outside the door of JOYCE
MANNER, ASST. PRINCIPAL’S office.

Winnie stares at Cairo.

                    CAIRO
          Any tool is a weapon if you hold it
          right.

                    WINNIE
          How do you just come up with this
          shit?

                    CAIRO
          Do you listen to anything I give
          you?

                    WINNIE
          Only the compliments.

                    CAIRO
          It’s Ani DiFranco. Do yourself a
          favor and have a listen through the
          canon.
          And have a cig with me.

                    WINNIE
          Okay.
          No.
          Okay.
          No.
          I’m just going to lay right down
          here and die.

Cairo digs through Winnie’s bag and pulls out the Muffin Men
logo.

                    CAIRO
          I’m gonna draw this on you.

                    WINNIE
          What?

                    CAIRO
          The logo. On your tits.

Winnie grins at her.

                    WINNIE
          Do it, you nasty bitch.


INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME NIGHT

Beatrice and Boris sit in the kitchen. Cartons of fried food
and several beer bottles are spread over the table. Beatrice
and Boris are drunk-ish. They laugh.

                    BEATRICE
          ...and anyway, I’m almost finished.
          Gonna fire the lot of them once it
          gets to publishing.

                    BORIS
          Did you come up with a title?

                    BEATRICE
          Yeah, but they hate it. Said it
          sounded like a sad love song. I
          told them it is.

                    BORIS
          What’s it called?

                    BEATRICE
          Lesser Expectations of a Greater
          Love.

The phone rings. Beatrice gets up to answer it. Boris texts
on his phone.

                    BEATRICE (CONT'D)
              (on the phone)
          Hello? This is his wife, who’s
          this? Uh huh, just a second.


INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jonathan stares at himself in the mirror. He looks sick.

                                                FLASH TO:

Jon’s POV. Cairo sits on the desk across from him, laughing
at something he’s said.

Beatrice pops her head in.
                      Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                 84.


                      BEATRICE
          Jon?

He watches her mouth move.

                    BEATRICE (CONT'D)
              (covering the receiver,
               drunk)
          It’s ah, Joyce? Want me to tell her
          you’ll call her back from prison?

She guffaws. He focuses on her tongue behind her teeth.

                      BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          Too soon?

He snaps to.

                    JONATHAN
          I’ll take it.

He takes the phone and Beatrice leaves. He takes a breath.

                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
              (on the phone)
          Hey Joyce, what’s up?


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Beatrice sits on the couch with Boris, who finishes his text
and puts his phone back in his pocket.

                    BEATRICE
          Who is she?

                    BORIS
          Not telling.

                    BEATRICE
          Becky? Tara? Tiffany.
          A stripper, naturally.

                    BORIS
          Why are you so mean?

                    BEATRICE
          Can I help it if every girl you’ve
          ever dated owns a pair of five inch
          lucite heels and is named after a
          character from the Babysitter’s
          Club? No I can’t.
          Your life, your choices.
                      Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)               85.


                    BORIS
          You’re a snob. Kristy was great.

                    BEATRICE
          She had one leg.

                    BORIS
          Shoulda seen the way that nub could
          work a pole.

                    BEATRICE
          That’ll do, Pig.

                    BORIS
          Pigs have thirty minute orgasms.
              (he downs his beer)
          Alright baby girl, I gotta run.

                      BEATRICE
          Don’t go.

                    BORIS
          I’ve got forty-five pop-quizzes on
          thermodynamics to grade. Or fail.
          We haven’t even reached fractals -
          fucking hopeless youth of America.
          Tell Jon I had to run?

                    BEATRICE
          You got it.

                    BORIS
          Thanks kiddo. I’ll see ya.

He leans down to kiss her and she turns her head so he kisses
her mouth. It’s a millisecond too long.

                      BEATRICE
          Gotcha.

Beat.

                    BORIS
          I gotta go.

                      BEATRICE
          So go.

He looks at her a moment longer and then leaves. Jonathan
enters, visibly shaken. Beatrice swivels her head at him.

                    JONATHAN
          Joyce got the story.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                  86.


                    BEATRICE
          What?

                    JONATHAN
          Well, it had “For Jonathan from
          Cairo” written at the top, so you
          know, no mistaking. She’d like to
          speak with me formally to go
          through the necessary paperwork.

                    BEATRICE
          Paperwork for what?

                    JONATHAN
          An incident report.
          I think she did it.

                    BEATRICE
          Think who did what?

                    JONATHAN
          Cairo. Cairo turned it in.

                    BEATRICE
          It’s a short story, Jon. Not a
          communist manifesto.

                    JONATHAN
          It’s the implication - if she
          convinces them that something
          happened between us, I could lose
          my job.

                    BEATRICE
          That’s not all you could lose.
          Did something happen between you?

                    JONATHAN
          Nothing I invited.

She stands. Sways a little.

                    BEATRICE
          Teenage girls are dangerous,
          Jonathan. I hope you know what
          you’re doing.

She walks past him into the kitchen. He stares at nothing.


INT. BENSON CITY REC CLUB - OUTSIDE - FOLLOWING MORNING

Various people in work out gear run around a track surrounded
by metal bleachers.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                87.


Jonathan, also in running gear, sits alone watching the
runners and smoking. He’s hungover. Boris enters the track
and jogs over to him with a spring in his step.

                    BORIS
          Sorry for bailing last night. You
          know how I feel about shitting in
          other people’s homes.

                    JONATHAN
          What’s with all the sunshine?
          You’re effervescent.

Boris pulls out his cellphone.

                    BORIS
          You won’t believe me if I tell you,
          so I’m just gonna show you.
          Don’t be judge-y.

                    JONATHAN
          Oh God. Okay. Show me.

He shows Jonathan a picture on his phone.

                    BORIS
          Take a look at that, my brother.

                    JONATHAN
          Woah. Woah. Who’s that?

                    BORIS
          You don’t recognize them?

                    JONATHAN
          Should I? Damn.
              (Boris flips the picture)
          Is that...is that the Muffin Men
          logo?

                    BORIS
          On perfectly pert perky tatas,
          painted to look like muffins.
          It’s genius.

                    JONATHAN
          Where do you find these girls?

Boris swipes to another picture, this one of Cairo and Winnie
kissing.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)        88.


                    BORIS
          That’s the beauty and the brain,
          brother. Being beautiful and not so
          smart.

Jonathan launches the phone back at Boris.

                    JONATHAN
              (horrified)
          Boris - You have to delete that.

                    BORIS
          Like hell I do.

                    JONATHAN
          Neither of those girls are
          eighteen. That’s child pornography.

                    BORIS
          Two girls making out in what could
          easily be bathing suits is not
          child pornography, it’s a beautiful
          statement about equal rights.

                    JONATHAN
          You don’t think this is deliberate?
          They’re fucking with you man, can’t
          you see that?

                    BORIS
          Calm down. I can like it enough for
          both of us.

                    JONATHAN
          Does this idiocy come naturally to
          you or is it an active effort?

                    BORIS
          Mostly natural. What’s your damage?

                    JONATHAN
          Cairo turned in her midterm and...I
          mean, I’ve read some prurient stuff
          before but she wrote some
          shameless, Marquis De Sade shit for
          me, man. Like a love letter. Like,
          she told me she did.
                    (MORE)
          Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)         89.

          JONATHAN (CONT'D)
And in a classic character foible
reserved for schmucks like me, I
mishandled her feelings and she
admitted the goddamn thing to
administration and I know how this
will sound, but I think she did it
to punish me because I didn’t
...because - I don’t know. And now
I have to meet with Joyce because
it was fucking dedicated to me and
I have to explain why and what it
means.

          BORIS
You couldn’t have known what she
was going to write.

          JONATHAN
I approved Henry Miller as her
author. I gave her the assignment
early. She said it was inspired by
me and her.
Fuck, this is so bad.

          BORIS
Was it?

          JONATHAN
Was it what?

          BORIS
Inspired by the two of you.

          JONATHAN
You can’t be serious.

          BORIS
Look, I know you’ve been marooned
on the Island of Sexless Toys and
then along comes this attractive,
intelligent girl who thinks you
invented the Oxford comma, who
worships you...you give her your
time, your attention, your effort -
I mean, you like her. I wouldn’t
blame you if you had a little
thing.

          JONATHAN
You think I could have a little
thing? She’s only seventeen.
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                 90.


                    BORIS
              (shrugging)
          Not that different from eighteen.

                    JONATHAN
          Yes the hell it is. One is legal
          and one is not.

                    BORIS
          Don’t tell me you haven’t thought
          about it.

                                                FLASH TO:

Cairo’s lips wrap around a cigarette. She laughs with it
between her teeth.

                       JONATHAN
          I haven’t.

                    BORIS
          You’re a fucking liar.

                    JONATHAN
          What do you want me to say? That I
          think she’s ideal - that I
          fantasize about being with her?

                       BORIS
          Do you?

                    JONATHAN
          What difference does it make?

                    BORIS
          It’s not exactly a mystery how you
          both have been feeling.

                                                FLASH TO:

Cairo and Jonathan talk with Boris in the morning.

                       JONATHAN
          Come on.

                    BORIS
          She’s special to you. You don’t
          have to be ashamed of it.

                                                FLASH TO:

Cairo and Jonathan on the porch at Mollie Fonatine’s.
                      Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)               91.


                    JONATHAN
          It was never my intention to blur
          the line.

                    BORIS
          Yeah but did you have any intention
          to clarify it?

                      JONATHAN
          But   clarify what, exactly? We got
          on.   We enjoy each other’s company.
          I’m   her teacher, she’s my student.
          How   could it be any clearer?

                    BORIS
          Oh, I don’t know...maybe without
          the special treatment, the
          socializing, the preemptive
          assignments, the clear
          favoritism...
          I just think you have to examine
          your own actions before you accuse
          a kid of going after you.

                                                 FLASH TO:

Cairo smiles. What once was sweet is now sinister.

                    JONATHAN
          The story is fetishistic. It’s
          filth. The fact that she has that
          kind of stuff rolling around in her
          brain is unsettling at best. The
          idea that she wrote it about us,
          that she told me she did, is beyond
          perception.

                    BORIS
          I think it turns you on.

                                                 FLASH TO:

Cairo brings a cigarette to her lips.

                    BORIS (CONT'D)
          That’s why you’re so riled and why
          you can’t stop obsessing over it.

                    JONATHAN
          Quit telling me what the fuck you
          think I think.

                    BORIS
          You want me to lie to you?
          You know I’m right.

                    JONATHAN
          This isn’t about how I feel it’s
          about what she implies - you
          realize people get crucified for
          shit like this while people like
          you are looking at naked pictures
          of your students.

                    BORIS
          Oh, I’m shaking in my boots. You
          know what your problem is? You’re
          just not fucking cool enough to be
          honest with yourself about anything
          that doesn’t fit your narrative.
          So what? You wanted to fuck her.
          Maybe you even loved her. You
          didn’t need to humiliate her to
          capture the moral high ground.
          It’s not a war.

                                                  FLASH TO:

Jonathan leans over Cairo’s desk to look over something she’s
written. Their faces are close.

                    JONATHAN
          No, it’s a witch hunt.

                    BORIS
          You’re the adult.
          Take some responsibility.

                       JONATHAN
          Fuck you.

                       BORIS
          Cool, Jon.

Boris leaves Jonathan sitting on the bleachers.


INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - LIBRARY - MORNING - SAME DAY

Morning light cuts into a vast and dark library through
partially drawn velvet curtains on floor to ceiling windows.

Shapes are hard to make out in the dimness of the room.
Everything is still.
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)              93.


Then, we see her. And only because she moves to light a
cigarette. Cairo sits in the shadow of the window, looking
out. Smoke billows above her.


INT. JONATHAN MILLER’S CLASSROOM - MORNING

Jonathan sits at his desk, head in his hand as he grades with
the other. The classroom is full, save for one desk in the
front. Cairo’s.

The class is watching GOOD MORNING, MISS DOVE.

The bell rings and everyone leaves but Winnie. He looks up at
her briefly, then back down at his papers.

                    WINNIE
          Have you seen Cairo?

                       JONATHAN
          I haven’t.

                    WINNIE
          I’m surprised she hasn’t come by.

Jonathan’s pen hesitates, only a moment.

                    WINNIE (CONT'D)
          I haven’t seen her in a few days.
          I thought maybe...you had.

                       JONATHAN
          I haven’t.

                    WINNIE
          You don’t text or anything?

He looks at her.

                    JONATHAN
          Did she tell you we do?

Beat.

                    WINNIE
          Well, you know, Cairo’s good at
          saying everything and nothing.

He’s at a loss. So is she.

                     WINNIE (CONT'D)
          I don’t understand what’s
          happening.
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                 94.


His eyes flash with gentle accusation.

                    JONATHAN
          Don’t you, Winnie?

They both look at one another. Desperation separates and
unifies them.


INT. JOYCE MANNER’S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

JOYCE MANNER, 40s, Assistant Principal at Benson High School,
sits behind her desk. Her educational diplomas from
Northwestern and a framed photo of her, her wife, and two
teenage daughters hangs on the wall.

INTERCUT between JONATHAN and JOYCE and CAIRO and JOYCE - two
separate conversations that feel like one.

                    JOYCE
          How did it start, in your own
          words?

                    CAIRO
          It was sort of like we recognized
          each other.

                    JONATHAN
          She’s exceptionally talented.
          Singular in that, at this school.

                    JOYCE
          Did you exhibit favoritism? Give
          special mentor-ship?

                       JONATHAN
          Of course.

                    CAIRO
          He was excited to give me the
          midterm assignment in advance.

                    JOYCE
          And the mid-term is what percentage
          of the final grade?

                    JONATHAN
          Twenty-five percent.

                    CAIRO
          Enough to destroy my GPA and ruin
          my shot at Stanford.
          Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)        95.


          JOYCE
You do know that Henry Miller is
not an approved author for public
school studies, right?

          JONATHAN
She’s better than the curriculum,
Joyce. You know that.
I wanted to help her stand out.

          CAIRO
I think he was impressed that I
knew who he was.
Have you read his work?

          JOYCE
How often did you see one another
beyond classroom time?

          CAIRO
Before school, and in class, of
course. Sometimes after.

          JOYCE
What would you do?

           CAIRO
Talk about literature, things we
care about. Sometimes we’d share a
cigarette.

          JONATHAN
We just happened to be in the same
place, smoking a cigarette. That’s
how it started, I guess. Not that
there’s anything - I mean that’s
how we started smoking together.

          JOYCE
Do you see each other socially?

          CAIRO
We went to a poetry reading
together.

          JONATHAN
Absolutely not.

          JOYCE
Would you have considered
yourselves friends?

          CAIRO
Without question.
          Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)         96.


          JONATHAN
I think we are as close as would be
appropriate for a student and a
teacher.

          JOYCE
Have you ever seen each other alone
outside of school?

          CAIRO
Only the one time.

           JONATHAN
Yes.
Sort of.
I mistakenly picked up her phone on
my way out of class and I went to
return it right away before my wife
and I left for a business trip in
Nashville.

          CAIRO
He came to my house.

          JOYCE
Were you alone?

          JONATHAN
Yes.

          CAIRO
My parents were out of town.

          JOYCE
And what happened?

          JONATHAN
Did she tell you something
happened?

          CAIRO
Nothing that didn’t seem okay at
the time...

          JONATHAN
I returned her phone.

          JOYCE
Did you go in the house?

          CAIRO
He told me to come outside to him.
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)              97.


                    JONATHAN
          I was brief.

                    CAIRO
          Mr. Miller always took the time to
          validate me.

                    JOYCE
          And what happened when you went
          outside?

                       CAIRO
          We kissed.

                     JONATHAN
          I didn’t touch her. And when she
          sent me the story, I told her it
          wasn’t appropriate for school.
              (beat)
          Listen, I think this is a teenage
          crush that took a hard leap
          sideways...I feel like there’s
          nothing I can say to defend my
          position.

                    JOYCE
          Because there isn’t.

Cairo leaves Joyce’s office. She’s not smiling. Not exactly.


INT. LOCAL RESTAURANT - EVENING

Jonathan walks into Winnie’s restaurant. Boris is already
seated at the bar. Jonathan sits down next to him.

                       JONATHAN
          Hey.

                    BORIS
          You want a drink?

                       JONATHAN
          Yes.

                    BORIS
          I thought you might.

Boris passes him a draught of beer. Jonathan takes a long
pull of it.

                    JONATHAN
          I’ve been suspended.
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)              98.


Boris holds up four fingers to the bartender.

                    BORIS
          On what grounds?

                       JONATHAN
          Hers.

The bartender sets down two doubles. Boris looks at Jonathan.

                    BORIS
          Did you love her?

Jonathan’s face crumples. Boris squeezes his hand and lets
Jonathan feel everything he’s feeling.

                    BORIS (CONT'D)
          To the grave, man.

Jonathan does his best to collect himself.

                    BORIS (CONT'D)
          What can I do?

                    JONATHAN
          Don’t leave me.

                     BORIS
          You’re my best friend, Jon. I won’t
          leave you.

                     JONATHAN
          Everything is falling.
              (beat)
          It didn’t have to be this way.

                    BORIS
          Maybe it did.

Jonathan looks at him with bleary eyes. He’s tired. Lost.

                    BORIS (CONT'D)
          You fall in love with things that
          diminish you because...I dunno,
          maybe you don’t think you deserve
          more. But you’re not a ladder, man.
          And you’ve made yourself into one.
          So...maybe make yourself into
          something else.

                       JONATHAN
          Like what?
                      Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                  99.


                    BORIS
          Something that can’t be climbed or
          crushed.

Jonathan tips the glass to his mouth and swallows the liquor
in one go.

                    JONATHAN
          My wife is gonna put me in the
          ground.

                    BORIS
          Beatrice is a reptile. Take the
          lashing and let it go.

                    JONATHAN
          This will hurt.

                    BORIS
          Like the goddamn devil.

Jonathan moves to pull out his wallet.

                    BORIS (CONT'D)
          It’s on me.

Jonathan stands. Boris gets up and hugs him, tight.

                    BORIS (CONT'D)
          Go with God, Jon.
          I’ll still be here.

Jonathan leaves. Boris sits back down at the bar. Winnie
comes over.

                    BORIS (CONT'D)
          Hey, sweetheart. Where you been?

                    WINNIE
          I didn’t want to bother you.

                      BORIS
          You okay?

                    WINNIE
          I’m...I dunno.
          How’s Mr. Miller?

                    BORIS
          Fucked six ways to Sunday. How’s
          Cairo?
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                  100.


                    WINNIE
              (heartbroken)
          She dumped me.

Not giving a damn who sees, he puts his hand on her face.

                    BORIS
          Natural disasters are bound to
          occur, baby. You’re gonna be
          alright.

She looks at him. True tenderness exists between them. He
drops his hand.

                    WINNIE
          I gotta get back.

                    BORIS
          I’ll see you.

She leaves. He takes a slow drink.


INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Jonathan leans against the sink. Beatrice stands in the
doorway. She’s drunk. He’s drowning.

                    BEATRICE
          Did you fuck her?

                    JONATHAN
          No.

                    BEATRICE
          What happened?

                    JONATHAN
          I don’t know.

                    BEATRICE
          You were there, weren’t you?

Beat.

                    JONATHAN
          She impressed me and I gave her
          preference. She turned in this
          story, which I obviously couldn’t
          accept - her feelings were hurt and
          she lashed out. That’s how I
          understand it.
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)             101.


                    BEATRICE
          You flirted with her and then you
          rejected her.

                    JONATHAN
          It wasn’t flirting.

                    BEATRICE
          What was it, then?

                       JONATHAN
          Affection.

                    BEATRICE
          Are you attracted to her?

He can’t answer her.

                    BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          I’ll tell you, then. This is about
          a girl who flattered you, who read
          your little book and your
          inevitable surrender to adulation.
          You fucking fell for it.
          Finally, finally someone gave your
          reductive little short stories a
          second glance and you can’t help
          but get hard for it because you
          suddenly feel worth something?

                    JONATHAN
          Yes, she made me feel worth
          something. What does that tell you?

She sways into the room and walks right up to him, pressing
her hips into his. She puts a hand on his face as though she
might kiss him.

                    BEATRICE
          Did her sycophancy get you hard or
          was it the smell of teen spirit?

                       JONATHAN
          Fuck you.

                    BEATRICE
          Be my guest.

She tilts her head up to him - their mouths almost touch.
Then she smiles. It’s awful. He jerks away from her.

                       JONATHAN
          Stop.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)               102.


                    BEATRICE
          Why should I? Did you?

                    JONATHAN
          I didn’t fuck her.

                    BEATRICE
          Then I guess you should try not to
          look so guilty.

                    JONATHAN
          I didn’t do anything wrong.

                    BEATRICE
          Didn’t you?

He looks around at his kitchen. At his beautiful, cold wife.

                    JONATHAN
          I’m in a futility myth.

                    BEATRICE
          How romantic.

                    JONATHAN
          Why are you so punishing?

A ragged, raging annoyance washes over her face.

                    BEATRICE
          You wanted her. I can read it all
          over you.

                    JONATHAN
          How can you read anything in this
          state, you fucking alcoholic. Jesus
          Christ.

                    BEATRICE
          It’s the only thing that makes you
          bearable.

She cuts him deep. He sucks in a sword of air through his
teeth.

                    JONATHAN
          You’re a monster.

                    BEATRICE
          And you’re a liar.
          You’re the banner boy of
          mediocrity, waving your flag of
          spotless virtue like some kind of
          middling American Hero.

                     BEATRICE (CONT'D)
          But Jon...you’re the villain.
          And you can’t even see it, can you?
          God, you are insufferably
          pedestrian. You abused your power.
          You manufactured all of this with
          your refusal to accept your fucking
          privilege.

They stare each other down. Truly looking into one another’s
eyes for the first time in longer than either can remember.

                    JONATHAN
          I love you.

                    BEATRICE
          What?

                    JONATHAN
          I don’t understand how you can say
          such things to me when I love you.

                    BEATRICE
          You think that exempts you from the
          truth?

                    JONATHAN
          From cruelty.

She laughs.

                    BEATRICE
          Honesty isn’t cruelty, you fragile
          fuck.

She walks right past him and pours a drink. To the brim. She
takes a long, slow gulp. He watches her.

                    JONATHAN
              (anguished)
          Don’t you worry for me at all?

                    BEATRICE
          What would I possibly worry about
          other than dying of boredom having
          to listen to your inventions of
          conflict?

Beat.

                    JONATHAN
          You are vile.
                        Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)            104.


                     BEATRICE
          But you’ve always known that,
          haven’t you?
              (beat)
          Why don’t you write about it?

She saunters out of the bloodbath, leaving him alone and
entirely defeated.


EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

Jonathan walks out of the house and faces the shed. The kudzu
almost reaches the ground and covers most of the windows.

Jonathan stares at it a moment, then, with his bare hands,
begins to rip the vines away. They are tough and tear his
skin. He cries and sweats and bleeds until it is all down.

Then he goes inside and shuts the door.


INT. CAIRO’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT EVENING

Cairo is sitting on her bed, leaning against the headboard,
hand writing on a legal pad in red ink. She smokes and ashes
into a coke can.

Winnie enters without knocking. Cairo pays her no attention.

Winnie stands there - mirroring them in a happier time. She’s
upset, nervous.

                    CAIRO
              (not looking up)
          Spit it out, Winnie.

                    WINNIE
          What are you doing?

                    CAIRO
          Completing my Stanford admissions
          essay.

                    WINNIE
          Is that all?

                    CAIRO
          I’m smoking a cigarette too, if you
          wish to be very literal.

                    WINNIE
          Why are you avoiding me?
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                  105.


                    CAIRO
          Because I don’t want to talk to
          you.

This hurts. Winnie is in uncharted waters.

                    WINNIE
          Cairo.

                    CAIRO
              (savage)
          What?

                    WINNIE
          ...What are you doing to Mr.
          Miller?

Cairo sets her notebook down and gives Winnie her full,
withering attention.

                    CAIRO
          I’m testifying against him.

                    WINNIE
          Why?

                    CAIRO
          He underestimated me.
          I overestimated him.

Winnie softens. Unsure what to believe.

                    WINNIE
          Are you okay?

                    CAIRO
          Of course. I’m inspired.

                    WINNIE
          That’s not funny.

                    CAIRO
          It is, a little.

                    WINNIE
          Please don’t do this.

                    CAIRO
          Why?

                    WINNIE
          People go to hell for things like
          this.
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)             106.


                    CAIRO
          No, Winnie. They go to Stanford.

They stare at one another. It takes Winnie a second, but she
connects the dots.

                    WINNIE
              (reeling)
          You created this.

                    CAIRO
          No. I capitalized on it.

                    WINNIE
          For what?
          To punish him because he didn’t
          want to fuck you?

                    CAIRO
          He wanted to fuck me, Winnie.

Cairo lights another cigarette.

                    WINNIE
          I’ll testify against you.

                    CAIRO
          No you won’t.

                       WINNIE
          Excuse me?

                    CAIRO
          I’ll show them what evidence I have
          against you and Boris and not only
          will your credibility be shot to
          shit, but you’ll incriminate him as
          well. Two teachers can lose their
          jobs.
          Oh hey...we could double team.

                    WINNIE
          This isn’t what I meant.

                    CAIRO
          Isn’t it? Haven’t I played it out
          exactly like you imagined?

                    WINNIE
              (weakly)
          I was joking -
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)               107.


                    CAIRO
          You weren’t joking. You just didn’t
          expect me to be better than you.

                    WINNIE
          Why are you doing this?

                    CAIRO
          Because he didn’t stop me.
          Because this is chess.

                    WINNIE
          It’s not a game.

                    CAIRO
          You’re right.
          It’s adversity, and I will overcome
          it.

She turns back to her legal pad. She is in profile against
the headboard. We pull back to reveal the wall behind her -
Jonathan, sitting at his desk in his shed.

They lean against each other in different spaces and times.


INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NASHVILLE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Close in on Jonathan reading Cairo’s short story. We look up
at him from the computer and watch the text project onto his
face and in the air around him.

                    JONATHAN (V.O.)
          Mr. Murphy drove with the
          resignation of the already dead. He
          imagined he felt the way Dylan
          Thomas did heading into the White
          Horse to take the drink that would
          kill him. He knew what they were
          and what they were not.

Slow close on the blue of his eye - in the reflection of his
pupil we see the story playing out - the slow drizzle of rain
and a dark haired girl standing at an open window. Closer and
closer until we’re there...


INT. CAIRO’S BEDROOM - SHORT STORY - FANTASY

The dark haired girl looks out the window. Behind her, the
room glows faintly with the soft diffused gray light of a
rainy afternoon.
                      Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                 108.


The window is open and fat rain drops smack against the sill.
We hear a car pull into the driveway.

Rain splashes her hand. Her cell phone rings and she answers.

Bold text appears on the screen, with a blinking cursor.

                    CAIRO
          “Hello”, she said.

                      JONATHAN (V.O.)
          I’m here.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          Alice thought immediately of a
          slaughtering lamb, though she
          couldn’t be certain which of them
          was meant for sacrifice.

Close on a water droplet landing on the white windowsill
into...


INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

A drop of water from the running bath has landed on the page
Jonathan is reading. He wipes at it and the ink runs.

His face is unreadable.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          He was outside. He was inside.

Jonathan blinks.


INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - SHORT STORY/FANTASY

When his eyes open, he stands before her in her bedroom. The
text floats over what we see, a reenactment of the story.

She puts a cigarette to her lips.

                    CAIRO
           You want one?

The flame and Cairo are reflected in Jonathan’s pupils.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          Smoke drifted from her mouth with
          practiced, cinematic effort.
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                109.


                       JONATHAN
             It excites you, doesn’t it? The
             surreptitiousness of it all.

                       CAIRO
             Is it more romantic for you that
             way?

He smiles.

                       CAIRO (V.O.)
             Mr. Murphy smiled wide, the lines
             around his mouth deepening into
             parentheses that framed his perfect
             lips into a punch line.

Jonathan’s face fills the frame, looking right at us.

                       JONATHAN
             This is no romance. I’m sorry to
             disappoint you.

He snatches her wrist and the cigarette falls to the floor,
spewing ash and spark from its tip before being crushed with
her shoe.


INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Jonathan’s eyes scan the page. He shifts on the floor.

                       CAIRO (V.O.)
             Alice opened her mouth to say
             something, but the words fell away.
             Mr. Murphy loomed over her, his
             Cadillac-blue eyes hungry and
             bored.


INT. CAIRO’S BEDROOM - SHORT STORY - FANTASY

CU on Jonathan as the dialogue spells itself out of his
mouth.

                       JONATHAN
             In what peril you find yourself.

His face is close to Cairo’s. We don’t see their legs, but we
see them shift.

                       CAIRO (V.O.)
             He pressed the knee of his starched
             chinos into the space between her
             legs.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)               110.


                    JONATHAN
          I want you to read to me.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          Alice watched in slow motion as Mr.
          Murphy’s tongue undulated when he
          spoke - pink tide against the bone
          shore of his teeth.

                    JONATHAN
          Read it to me the way you read it
          to yourself.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          Their bodies separated like a
          single cell splitting.

ECU on Cairo’s sticky glossed lips separating in slow motion.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          Alice took the tattered Henry
          Miller paperback off of the bedside
          table and spread it open on the
          comforter of her bed.

CU on a large framed print of Virginia Woolf - the last
portrait taken of her, smoking a cigarette. In the reflection
of the glass, we watch Cairo lean over the book and bed.
Jonathan stands behind her.

                    JONATHAN (V.O.)
          Page thirteen he said, behind her.
          One hand slid up the front of
          Alice’s short cotton dress, as the
          other pointed to a sentence on the
          page.

A slender finger points to the page. Another moves up her
leg.

                    JONATHAN
          Begin here.

                     CAIRO
              (reading)
          It’s not because she’s a child,
          it’s because she’s a child with no
          innocence.

Jonathan slips his hand into his pajama pants.

INT. CAIRO’S BEDROOM - SHORT STORY - FANTASY

A spider crawls across a window sill.

                    JONATHAN (V.O.)
          He was against her then and Alice
          felt a push of muscular wetness
          between her legs. Mr. Murphy placed
          his slender hand over hers and
          guided her to the mound at her
          center, pressing her fingers into
          the dark fold there—

Fingers move over white fabric.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          -just behind the damp fabric of her
          panties, feeling her feel herself.

                    JONATHAN (V.O.)
          He found his way around the elastic
          at her leg and slid two deft
          fingers into the warm darkness of
          her virgin cunt.

We watch what they describe.

                    JONATHAN
          Keep reading.

CU on Cairo’s mouth as she reads. CU on Jonathan’s mouth as
he listens.

                    CAIRO
              (reciting)
          Look into her eyes and you see the
          monster of knowledge, the shadow of
          wisdom—

                    JONATHAN (V.O.)
          She felt him shift, his weight
          suddenly very low. He kissed her
          ass through her dress, pressed his
          face to it.

                    CAIRO
              (reciting)
          -the roundness and shapelessness of
          childhood have scarcely left her
          body. She is a woman in miniature,
          a copy as yet incomplete.
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                 112.


INTERCUT between the hotel bathroom and Cairo’s short story.
Images of the real Cairo, Jonathan, Beatrice, Boris and
Winnie begin to blend with what he sees.

Jonathan’s hand is on her bare thigh.

Cairo’s hands resting between her legs under her desk.

                    JONATHAN (V.O.)
          A thousand years of violence and
          conquering boiled within him as he
          held the mouth of her pubis like a
          hooked fish - a thing gasping for
          release, for mercy, for death.

Close on the back of Cairo’s neck and Jonathan’s open mouth
against it.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          Alice stopped reading.

Cairo’s hands grip the comforter.

CU on a half-eaten muffin. An ant picks away pieces of it.

                    JONATHAN (V.O.)
          Her gullet tightened as he went
          deeper within — searching for the
          answer to a question he’d doubted—

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          -but there it was—

Jonathan is masturbating in the bathroom.

                    JONATHAN (V.O.)
          -the answer and the question
          separated by that thin fleshy veil—
          the cicatrix that will never heal-

Blots of dark red ink drop onto a thick white page.

Winnie, wearing no make up, uses a fine watercolor paintbrush
to thin out the ink in a long slender stroke.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          -the serpent’s apple.

The spider crawls onto the bed.

                    JONATHAN (V.O.)
          He would renounce everything he
          believed in for a taste of her. He
          would abandon all of his burdens—
                     Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)                  113.


Beatrice sucks a raw oyster out of its shell.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          The impassive, harpy wife, the
          marginalization-

CU on Beatrice’s hands as she uses Apostrophes & Ampersands
as a coaster for her bourbon.

                    JONATHAN (V.O.)
          The ethics, the abstemiousness—

Cairo watches Jonathan with his back to us, standing at a
blackboard. She sits at her desk and scratches a raw mosquito
bite on her ankle with her other foot.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          All surrendered and sacrificed to
          the seduction of subjugation.

Cairo’s earring is tangled in her hair.

Jonathan masturbates in the shower while Beatrice brushes her
teeth at the sink.

                    JONATHAN (V.O.)
          He peeled the wet cotton down her
          legs and pressed into her from
          behind, the width of his face
          forcing her legs apart at their
          seam. Her cul was slick against his
          chin—

Jonathan presses Cairo’s bare shoulders onto the bed, his
fingers splayed wide over her blades as her hair fans out
above her. The muscles in her back shiver as he moves against
her.

                    CAIRO (V.O.)
          Just as he imagined it was when she
          was alone, maybe in her bedroom—

The spider crawls across Cairo’s pillow.

Boris and Winnie pass in the hall. Neither looks at the
other.

                    JONATHAN (V.O.)
          Maybe in a bathroom stall at
          school, her own fingers knuckle
          deep - trying to rub out that itch-

A pair of shoes under a bathroom stall, panties stretched
around the ankles.
                       Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy)             114.


                       CAIRO/JONATHAN (V.O.)
             The ache inside.

Jonathan’s face against Cairo’s.

Wide shot of the hotel room. Jonathan with his back to us
against the frosted glass bathroom door. Beatrice sits in
bed, typing. Separate worlds.

                       JONATHAN (V.O.)
             He saw himself burying his cock in
             her, brutally fucking away the
             exigency that swelled her clit and
             choked her better judgements.
             He would fill her up with cum.

CU on Cairo’s eye. Reflected in it is the spider, crawling
across the sheets.


INT. JONATHAN’S OFFICE/SHED - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Jonathan cums.

He sits there a moment, the computer bright before him. He
closes his eyes.

THE LIGHTS IN THE SHED ARE SUDDENLY BRIGHT AND AUSTERE. He
opens his eyes to...


EXT. COURTHOUSE - MORNING

Jon sits alone on a bench outside. He lights a cigarette.

Cairo walks toward him, her parents and Joyce in tow. She
wears a skirt, sweater and keds, and looks terribly young.

She waves to him.

A slow, sad smile spreads across her face.

Checkmate.

Slow rise upward. Above the characters. Above the courthouse.
Above the trees.

Kudzu chokes everything.
