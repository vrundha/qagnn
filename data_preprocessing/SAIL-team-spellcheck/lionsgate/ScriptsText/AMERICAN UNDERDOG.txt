1   INT. WARNER HOUSE - AFTERNOON

    CLOSE ON A TV: JOE MONTANA drives down field in Super Bowl
    XIX for the San Francisco 49ers.

    TWO BOYS sit in front of a small TUBE TV. KURT (9), energetic
    and athletic, is glued to the screen, watching Montana’s
    every move. His brother, MATT (11), glasses and a natural
    bookworm, huffs as he watches. Mildly interested.

    Sports TROPHIES cover the humble walls and shelves.

    THE GAME ENDS. The 49ers WIN. Kurt fixes his eyes on the
    screen. On the celebration. On Montana -- and the number on
    the back on his jersey: #16. Then:

    DUCT TAPE on the back of an old t-shirt doubling for a
    jersey. The tape forms the number 13, with the name WARNER
    above it. Kurt smooths out the shirt, looks it over with a
    smile, and a dream. Then:

                        KURT
              MATT!!


2   EXT. WARNER HOUSE - SUNSET

    A brisk mid-western day. IN THE YARD, Matt lines up as wide
    receiver. Kurt calls HIKE, then narrates his Super Bowl win.

                        KURT
              Tie game with two minutes left.
              Warner drops back. He rolls left.
              Sees his man. Time running out
              AND...

    THROWS. But Matt breaks right instead of left and the ball
    DROPS in the grass. Kurt throws his hands in the air.

                        KURT (CONT'D)
              What was THAT?? I said left! You
              had ONE JOB!

                        MATT
              Easy for you to say, this is all
              you do well.

                        KURT
                  (ignoring him)
              Let’s go again.

                        MATT
              It was fourth down, we lost!
                                                                2.


                        KURT
              No! There was a penalty. Go AGAIN!

    Matt HUFFS toward the house, done.

                        KURT (CONT'D)
              Where are you going? Get back here
              and WIN THE SUPER BOWL WITH ME!


3   INT. WARNER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

    Matt sits in front of the TV. Switches the dial to Channel 3
    and plays COMBAT on ATARI.

    THUMP! The football hits the wall outside and the TV goes
    STATICKY.

                        MATT
              Kurt, STOP!

    Another THUMP!

                        MATT (CONT'D)
              You’re messing up the TV!!


4   EXT. WARNER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

    Kurt hurls the ball again. WHAM!

                        MATT (O.S.)
              STOP!

    A beat up Honda Accord sputters into the driveway. Kurt’s
    mother SUE (30s) climbs out. Weary and tired, she wears a
    work uniform and carries grocery bags.

    Kurt runs to her, wrapping his arms around her. It’s obvious
    how much he loves her.

                        SUE
              Hey baby. Who won the game?

                        KURT
              49ers! Duh. Montana was amazing.
                  (rattling on as they walk)
              331 yards, 4 touchdowns, he rushed
              59 yards -- that’s more than their
              running back...!
                                                               3.


5   INT. WARNER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

    Kurt and Matt clear space on the cluttered table for dinner.
    Mom pulls TV dinners from the oven with one hand, sifting
    through PAST DUE bills with the other.

    Sue sits at the table with the two boys. Kurt holds up a
    SNEAKER, dirty and worn, a hole in the bottom.

                        KURT
              Mom, I need new shoes.

                        SUE
              Sneakers have to last the school
              year, you know the deal. Put
              cardboard in em’.
                  (off his look)
              No whining. Now bow your heads.
                  (closes her eyes)
              Bless this food to the nourishment
              of our bodies. In the name of the
              Father, the Son --

    Kurt’s already taking a bite.

                        SUE (CONT'D)
              Kurtis!
                  (he puts it back)
              -- and the Holy Spirit, amen.

                        BOYS
              Amen.

    Kurt digs in.

                        SUE
              How was school?

                        MATT
              Got my report card. Four As. One B.
              Dad said I get a dollar for ever A!

                        SUE
              How bout all As next time. Kurtis?

                        KURT
              Where is dad? He was supposed to be
              here this weekend.

                        SUE
              He had to switch. How’s school for
              you?

    Kurt hesitates. Matt jumps in.
                                                               4.


                        MATT
              Detention. Again. I had to sit and
              wait for an hour --

                        KURT
              No, you didn’t!

                        MATT
              -- cause you’re slow.

                        KURT
              Faster than you!

                        MATT
              I meant stupid!

    This triggers something in Kurt - he punches Matt in the
    shoulder and Matt punches him back. Sue grabs them both.

                        SUE
              BOYS! Enough! Eat your dinner, or
              so help me GOD!

    Matt scowls at Kurt. But Kurt just stews. Then he STORMS OUT.

    Mom shoots Matt a look. Then they hear it - THUMP! Against
    the side of the house.


6   EXT. WARNER HOME - CONTINUOUS

    Kurt holds the FOOTBALL. Eyes blurred with tears. Sue walks
    over beside him.

                        SUE
              Throw for me?

    Kurt shakes his head. Drops the ball to the ground.

                        KURT
              Don’t feel like it.

                        SUE
              Hey. You don’t get ‘A’s, So what?
              Neither did I. But you got a shelf
              full of trophies. All it takes is
              bein’ great at one thing.
                  (picks up the football)
              This is yours. But talent isn’t
              enough, Kurtis. You have to work
              harder than everyone else. Never
              quit.
                                                             5.


                        KURT
              You and Dad did.

                        SUE
              That’s different. With
              relationships... But don’t let that
              stop you. You have a gift, Kurtis.

    She hands him the football.

                        SUE (CONT'D)
              Maybe some day this ball will
              define you.
                  (he looks up at her)
              Then it won’t matter what people
              say. Cause you’ll be the best. And
              no one can argue with that.

    She hands the ball back to him.

                        SUE (CONT'D)
              I gotta get back to work.

    She pats him on the back, then heads to her car. Thirty yards
    away she stops. Turns back.

                        SUE (CONT'D)
              Hey. Throw it to me.

                        KURT
              I can’t throw it that far.

                        SUE
              Won’t know till you try.

    Kurt winds back, cocks his arms, and throws with everything
    he’s got. AS THE BALL FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, WE:

    SMASH TO BLACK:

    Giant letters scroll across the screen (in homage to ROCKY):

                A M E R I C A N   U N D E R D O G


7   EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

    A FOOTBALL spirals in perfect SLOW MOTION. Finally CAUGHT by
    a receiver for a 40 yard gain. The CROWD ERUPTS.

               University of Northern Iowa. 1993

    The UNI Quarterback steps to the line for the next play. BUT
    it’s not who we expect. Not #13. NOT WARNER.
                                                                 6.


     The camera DRIFTS beyond the action to the UNI sidelines...
     Past front line COACHES and players. Past DEFENSE huddling...

     FINALLY settles at the distant bench. A player as far from
     the game as possible. We see his Jersey: WARNER. #13.
     Benchwarmer.

     KURT (now 22), square jaw. Perfect archetype of a QB. Except
     for the not playing part. His leg jackhammers up and down.
     Impatient. He’s dying to be on the field. Looks to the
     scoreboard: IT’S LATE IN THE GAME. They’re losing.

     The UNI QB runs off the field after a three and out,
     frustrated. Argues with HEAD COACH ALLEN, making excuses.
     Kurt stands and calls out.

                         KURT
               Hey Coach! Put me in and I’ll win
               for you. COACH!

     Coach Allen trades a glance with him. Then looks the other
     way and the moment is over.

                         KURT (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
               I’m sick of it, Mom. I mean it, I’m
               done!


8    INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

     Kurt is the last guy in the locker room. He clutches a
     PAYPHONE in the corner.

                         SUE (O.S.)
               No. You stay in the game.

                         KURT
               There is no game. That’s the
               problem. I did everything right to
               get here and I’ve been sitting on a
               bench for four years. I can’t get
               on the field.

                         SUE
               So find a way. No one said it would
               be easy. Warners don’t quit.

     Kurt sighs, frustrated. Leans against the wall in silhouette.


10   INT. KURT AND MIKE HUDNUTT’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

     A college jock apartment. Beer-stained couches, clothes
     everywhere, neon Bud Light sign on the wall.
                                                         7.


ON THE FLOOR, Kurt sits in front of a stack of VCRs strapped
to a mini TV. He toggles through GAME FOOTAGE, trying to cut
together a reel.

Kurt’s roommate emerges from his room in a plaid shirt and
cowboy boots. This is MIKE HUDNUTT (22). Six feet, 250 pounds
wide, Kurt’s best friend and anchor of the offensive line.

                    MIKE HUDNUTT
          Okay. Pick one.

Mike holds up two giant belt BUCKLES.

                    KURT
          Your buckles are like your music,
          Mike. They’re all the same.

                    MIKE HUDNUTT
          How dare you? These tell two very
          different stories. I’ll take this
          one. You wear the other.

                    KURT
          What? No. I have work to do.

Kurt turns back to the VCR. Scrolls through: NUMBER 13, in
his Panther uniform, dropping back and firing a bullet.

                    MIKE HUDNUTT
          That’s not work. Can’t make a
          highlight reel without highlights,
          pal. Just sayin.

                    KURT
          I have highlights.

                    MIKE HUDNUTT
          You have one. One highlight.
          Anyway, who you gonna send it to?

                    KURT
          Scouts. Agents.

                    MIKE HUDNUTT
          You really are delusional. The NFL
          don’t draft players that never
          started a college game at a 1AA
          school in Iowa.
              (drops one of the buckles
               in front of Kurt)
          Come on - we’re going out.

                    KURT
          I will never wear that.
                                                                 8.


     And...


11   EXT. WILD E. COYOTE BAR - NIGHT

     A country western bar. Flashing neon sign reads: “WILD E.
     COYOTE”. Underneath it hangs a “LADIES NIGHT” banner.

     Mike’s Monster truck pulls into the parking lot, country
     music BLASTING from the stereo. In the passenger seat, Kurt
     SIGHS.

                         KURT
               Turn it OFF. You’re killing me, man.


12   INT. WILD E. COYOTE BAR - NIGHT

     Kurt steps into the smokey dive bar. He cringes, eyeing the
     giant DANCE FLOOR where dozens of cowgirls and cowboys are
     smack in the middle of a LINE DANCE.

     Kurt shakes his head, instantly miserable. Mike slaps him on
     the back...

                         MIKE HUDNUTT
               It’s gonna be a fun night!

     And heads off to greet his friends, leaving Kurt by himself.
     Looking very out of place in a t-shirt, jeans and sneakers.

     As Mike stomps into the dancing crowd, Kurt heads straight
     for the bar. Within seconds, every BLONDE seems to be eyeing
     him. But Kurt can’t be bothered.

     LATER, the dancing continues, but Kurt hasn’t budged. He just
     sips his beer, ignoring the women circling him. Then he looks
     to the DANCE FLOOR and his gaze lands on:

     ONE GIRL. In the middle of the action. Short skirt, cowboy
     boots and spikey dark hair. She’s brash and badass and funny
     all at the same time. This is BRENDA MEONI (25).

     Brenda dances with a HELL’S ANGEL three times her age, then
     spins away and joins a skinny rodeo guy, then moves on again,
     from guy to guy, but not flirting -- it’s all about the
     dancing. And SHE’S GREAT AT IT. She lights everyone up around
     her, and Kurt is immediately captivated.

     He steps closer, watching her. Then Brenda turns his way and
     THEIR EYES MEET...
                                                              9.


     And for just a split-second... EVERYTHING SEEMS TO STOP. The
     room goes quiet. Kurt is locked in. Doesn’t even blink.
     Brenda meets his gaze, curious.

     Kurt takes a step toward her on the DANCE FLOOR when:

                         BARTENDER (O.S)
               All right y’all, line up, it’s a
               BARN DANCE!

     Everyone scrambles, guys in one line facing girls in another.
     Hudnutt included. And Brenda still right in the middle of it
     all. Kurt retreats, back to the bar. Total fish out of water.
     But he keep his eye locked on Brenda. Who is this girl??


13   EXT. NORTHERN IOWA STADIUM - DAY

     MID-PRACTICE. Kurt drops back in the pocket. He looks up to
     see the DEFENSE RUSHING HIM. And he panics. Kurt SCRAMBLES
     BACK.

                         COACH ALLEN
               Stay in the pocket, Warner!

     Kurt dodges to the sideline, but still makes a stellar throw.
     Caught 25 yards downfield. Kurt looks to the coach. Not
     impressed.

                         KURT (PRE-LAP)
               You promised me. You promised if I
               waited my turn I’d play.

     AFTER PRACTICE, Kurt faces off with the Coach. Frustrated.

                         COACH ALLEN
               My promise to this university is to
               put the best out on the field.

                         KURT
               If the best were on the field we’d
               be winning! I can win for you, it’s
               what I’ve been doing my whole life!

                         COACH ALLEN
               You know what your problem is,
               Warner? Want me to sum it up for
               you? Why you’re such a tragedy? You
               don’t stay in the pocket.

                         KURT
               What??
                                                             10.


                         COACH ALLEN
               You have the talent, loads of it.
               But when things get hard, you bail.
               You run from adversity. You don’t
               trust your team or my playbook.
                   (as Kurt tries to object)
               Staying in the pocket means
               standing your ground and taking the
               hit, no matter how much it hurts.
               That’s what leaders do. And you’re
               not a leader.

                         KURT
               That’s not true! Give me a shot to
               prove myself. Let me start one
               game.

                         COACH ALLEN
               Practice is where you prove
               yourself. You don’t deserve to play
               in the game.

     Coach walks away. Kurt chase after.

                         KURT
               Coach, wait! Ten more games and my
               dream is gone. I’ve been working my
               whole life for this. PLEASE.

                         COACH ALLEN
               You need to start thinking about
               life after football, son.

     Kurt steps in front of him, defiant.

                         KURT
               No. I WILL NOT QUIT, sir. Just TELL
               ME WHAT I NEED TO DO.

     Coach studies Kurt. This kid. But there IS a fire in him.
     THEN:


14   EXT. FOOTBALL PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

     WHAM! Kurt gets SLAMMED hard by a MASSIVE DEFENSIVE END. He
     hits the ground. Looks to the coach in confusion.

                         COACH ALLEN
               Again!

     Kurt shakes it off and lines up for a snap. Hike! Drops back
     in the pocket and WHAM!!! Taken down again.
                                                             11.


                         KURT
               How many times we gonna do this,
               Coach? Just... wanna pace myself.

                         COACH ALLEN
               As many as I say. You take the hit.
               No matter what comes at you. You
               can throw, but you cannot leave the
               pocket. You want your shot, you
               take the pain.

     MOMENTS LATER... WHAM!! Another BRUTAL hit.

     NEXT ONE - Kurt gets off a haphazard throw, but still gets
     drilled to the ground.

                         COACH ALLEN (CONT'D)
               Who else wants to kill Kurt?

     Hands go up everywhere, including HUDNUTT.

                         KURT
               You’re on offense, Mike.

                         MIKE HUDNUTT
               I’ll switch for this!

     And... BAM! Kurt goes down again.

                         COACH ALLEN
               Can you take it? Or you gonna quit?

     He wills himself off the ground.

                         KURT
               Just getting warmed up, Coach.


15   EXT. HY-VEE SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - LATER

     Mike and Kurt push their cart from the market, loaded up on
     chips and donuts. Mike already chows down on a bag of Nachos.

     Kurt limps along, sore, leaning on the cart. They pass a
     STOCK BOY, hard at work unpacking a pallet. Mike nudges Kurt.

                         MIKE HUDNUTT
               Could be worse, right?

     He slaps Kurt on the back. Kurt winces. Glancing one more
     time at the stock boy. As they approach Mike’s truck:
                                                             12.


                         KURT
               Hudd, I need a favor. You’re gonna
               laugh.

                         MIKE HUDNUTT
               Can’t wait to hear this.

     Kurt stops and turns.

                         KURT
               Teach me to dance.

                         MIKE HUDNUTT
               Dance?? Like... LINE dance?

                         KURT
               No. Like that... you know, the Barn
               Dance. For instance.

     And sure enough, Mike LAUGHS. Loud. Milking it. Finally...

     MOMENTS LATER The groceries are in the flatbed but the stereo
     is BLASTING Tim McGraw. Mike leads Kurt through the Barn
     Dance moves. Mike is still laughing. The stock boy watches
     them, like “What in the literal hell?”


16   INT. WILD E. COYOTE BAR - NIGHT

     Kurt still wears his normal jeans and t-shirt, but this time
     he’s sporting one of Mike’s giant belt buckles. Mike GRINS.

                         MIKE HUDNUTT
               You know how happy this makes me?

     Kurt ignores him, scanning the crowd for Brenda. He steps up
     to the bar, nods to the bartender, who’s also the DJ.

                         KURT
               You guys have daiquiris?

     The bartender looks at him, deadpan. Kurt glances behind the
     bar to a pin up CALENDAR and he does a double take. It’s
     Brenda. On the calendar. In a bright red shirt, jean shorts
     and big boots - “Miss August”.

     Then he hears her voice and turns... THERE SHE IS. On the
     dance floor, as always. Brenda spots him, too. As if she was
     hoping.

                         KURT (CONT'D)
                   (to bartender)
               Hold up, forget the drink!
                         (MORE)
                                                         13.

                    KURT (CONT'D)
          Can you play one of those line
          dances... No, wait, Barn Dance.
          Please.

He drops a five on the bar. The bartender glances at Brenda.
He gets it.

                    BARTENDER (O.S.)
          Aright! Barn dance, everyone!

A SONG STARTS and Brenda jumps into position. Kurt quickly
steps over, joins the line of men, facing off with the women.
He does his best to keep up, using the moves Mike taught him,
but his attention is mainly on getting to Brenda.

Kurt cheats a few times, skipping the girl he’s supposed to
do-si-do with, messing up the dance a bit, until finally --

He is FACE to FACE with her. Brenda raises an eyebrow.

                    BRENDA
          About time.

He smiles. So does she. Kurt takes her by the hand and they
dance. He struggles to do the steps properly, while she is
smooth as silk.

                    BRENDA (CONT'D)
          You don’t look like a cowboy.

                    KURT
          Cause I’m not.

                    BRENDA
          So what are you, then?

                    KURT
          Football player.

                    BRENDA
          Do you have a name?

                    KURT
          Kurt... Warner. And you are?

She looks into his eyes. Hmm.

                    BRENDA
          Nope. Not yet.

Kurt is getting better. It comes time for the partners to
switch but he just spins past another girl and lands back in
front of Brenda. Over the music:
                                                           14.


                    BRENDA (CONT'D)
          Supposed to switch.

                    KURT
          But I haven’t gotten your name yet.

He causes another traffic jam. She just smiles and keeps
dancing.

LATER. AT THE BAR. Brenda drinks a dark lager. Kurt nurses a
daiquiri, complete with an umbrella. Brenda eyes it, judging.

                    KURT (CONT'D)
          What?? I like what I like.

She nods. Okay.

                    BRENDA
          So... football. Tell me about that.

                    KURT
          How do you mean? What do you want
          to know?

                    BRENDA
          Well, you described yourself as a
          sport. Must be pretty important to
          you. Why?

                    KURT
          How about this, I’ll answer your
          question if you answer mine....
          Miss August?

He motions to the calendar. She laughs and nearly spits her
beer.

                    BRENDA
          That’s ah... Well... it’s a “Hot
          Pants” competition. First Thursday
          of every month. First time I won
          so... God, this is embarrassing.
              (A look. A moment. Then...)
          So football. Give me an honest
          answer and I’ll give you my name.

Kurt nods. Deal.

                     KURT
          Ok, so. Football is the first thing
          my Dad ever taught me, before...
          Before he left. It helped me
          through a lot of hard times...
              (beat)
                     (MORE)
                                                        15.

                     KURT (CONT'D)
          You know. Single mom. Always
          struggling, never had enough. And I
          wanted.... more. To make something
          of myself. And football was all I
          was ever good at. As long as I had
          a ball in my hand, I felt like
          everything was gonna be alright. I
          felt... alive. I guess. Kinda like
          right now.
              (she grins)
          So it’s more than a game for me.
          It’s a chance to be proven worthy.
              (beat)
          Honest enough for ya?

                     BRENDA
          It’s a start...
              (then)
          Come on, more dancing!

She grabs his hand and pulls him back to the DANCE FLOOR.

MOMENTS LATER they’re LINE DANCING this time. Except Kurt is
facing the wrong way. Backwards. Looking right at Brenda.
He’s confident now, doesn’t care about the moves.

                    BRENDA (CONT'D)
          Turn around!

                    KURT
          I like this view better.
              (to everyone)
          She won’t tell me her name.

He’s being a ham, and everyone buys in. Except Brenda, who
rolls her eyes. She steps forward and turns Kurt back around
to face the right way.

AND NOW IT’S MIDNIGHT. They’re slow dancing. And Kurt is very
happy about it. The place has mostly cleared out. The night
belongs to them. A slower song begins -- ‘Fishin’ in the
Dark’ by Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Brenda perks up.

                    KURT (CONT'D)
          Okay. This one I actually like. And
          I hate country music.

                    BRENDA
          Oh yeah? Well, I hate sports, so...
          guess it’ll never work between us.

                       KURT
          Guess not.
                                                                16.


     Kurt pulls her even closer. Brenda rests her head on his
     shoulder.

                         BRENDA
               Why do you like this song?

                         KURT
               Cause it’s different. Like you.

     Brenda smiles, then lifts her head to look Kurt in the eye.
     It’s electric. Finally...

                         BRENDA
               I’m Brenda.

                         KURT
               Good to meet you, Brenda.

     Brenda leans closer into him. They almost kiss, THEN -- the
     house lights start blinking.

                         BRENDA
               And I gotta go.

     She pulls away and heads straight for the back entrance.

                          KURT
               Wait!


17   EXT. WILD E. COYOTE BAR - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

     Kurt catches up to Brenda as she opens the door to her rusty,
     1979 Buick Regal. Two car seats in the back.

                         KURT
               Can I at least have your number?

                         BRENDA
               Trust me. You don’t want it.

                          KURT
               Why not?

                         BRENDA
               Look, there’s a few things you need
               to know about me. I’m divorced...
               and I got two kids.

     She looks up at him. Honest.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
               So if I never see you again, I
               totally understand.
                                                             17.


     She slides behind the wheel, starts her car and drives off.
     Kurt stands, speechless, unsure what just hit him.

     IN THE CAR - Brenda checks her REAR VIEW, sees Kurt still
     standing there, fading off the distance. Fights the urge to
     turn the car around.


18   INT. BRENDA’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT

     Brenda enters, still in a daze. Her mom, JENNY JO (50’s),
     sits in a recliner, baby JESSE (1) asleep on her shoulder.

                         JENNY JO
               So? Was ‘the guy’ there?

                         BRENDA
               He was, actually.

                         JENNY JO
               And...?

     Mom leans in, really wants the scoop. But Brenda just shrugs.

                         BRENDA
               What’s the point, Mom?


19   INT. KID’S ROOM - NIGHT

     A small room, squeezed with two twin beds and a crib. Brenda
     lays the baby down, then kicks off her boots, exhausted.

     Brenda snuggles next to ZACK (4) in a bed too small for the
     two of them. Zack feels for her hand, pulls it right over his
     heart. He whispers.

                         ZACK
               Sing the song?

                         BRENDA
                   (singing)
               There came three gypsies to my
               door, Inquiring after my lady oh,
               One sang high and the other sang
               low, And the third sang...

                         ZACK AND BRENDA
               Bonnie bonnie biscay oh...
                                                              18.


21   INT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - MORNING

     Morning rush. Brenda gets the kids ready. She wears an old
     robe, no makeup, hair a mess. BABY JESSE CRIES at the table.
     Refuses to eat apple sauce.

                         BRENDA
               Eat your food and you can get down.

     Jesse unleashed more FURY. Zack rounds the corner, hand
     touching the wall for guidance. It’s obvious he’s disabled,
     possibly blind, but it doesn’t slow him down. He holds an old
     radio in his hand.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
               Over here, baby.

     Zack hands her the radio. Swaying back and forth.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
               Is it broken?

                         ZACK
               Broken, Mama.

                         BRENDA
               I can’t fix it right now. I gotta
               feed Jesse.

     WHAM. Apple sauce sprays all over Brenda’s robe and hair.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
               Jesse! NO! No.

     Jesse LAUGHS now. More sauce on the walls. THEN:

     A KNOCK on the sliding glass door, covered by vertical
     blinds. Brenda looks up. Totally confused.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
               Mom? Dad? Just a minute!

     She twists the blinds open to reveal... KURT. Smiling.
     Holding a single ROSE. Brenda’s eyes go wide. What the hell??

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
               Wha... Hi. Can you just. Ah...

     Then she realizes what she’s wearing. She brushes her hand
     through her hair. Feeling the apple sauce.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
               Just... Give me a minute.
                                                             19.


     She CLOSES the blinds before he can say anything.

     OUTSIDE, Kurt waits. He looks around. Fiddles with the rose.
     Starting to feel pretty stupid.

                         KURT
               Is this a bad time? I can come back
               if...
                   (to himself)
               This was such a bad idea.

     Finally the blinds twist open. Kurt smiles, but NO ONE is
     there. Then the door unlocks and slides open.

     Kurt looks down to see... ZACK. Still holding the radio. He
     reaches out and touches Kurt’s jeans. His version of seeing.

                         KURT (CONT'D)
               Hi. Where did your mom go?

     Zack smiles. Takes him by the big finger and pulls him into
     the house.

                            ZACK
               Come on.


22   INT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Zack leads Kurt down the hallway. Kurt looks to the mess at
     the kitchen table. Apple sauce still drips down the walls.
     But Brenda is nowhere to be found.

     ON THE MANTLE, Kurt notices PHOTOS of Brenda in full MARINE
     UNIFORM.

     Zack walks to the door of the bedroom, points to a radio that
     sits beside the bed. It PLAYS COUNTRY MUSIC softly. Zack
     walks over and taps the working radio.

     Kurt peers in at the unmade beds, crammed next to each other.
     Then Zack pulls him into the...

     BATHROOM. Where he sets the radio on the counter. Mashing its
     buttons.

                            ZACK
               Broken.

                            KURT
               The radio?

     Zack nods. Kurt looks it over. Spots a power cable dangling
     nearby. He plugs the radio in. Adjusts the antenna. STATIC.
                                                          20.


Zack smiles. Turning the dial. Finding the same COUNTRY
station. Kurt cringes at his choice of music.

                    KURT (CONT'D)
          Country, really? They got to you,
          too?

Zack nods. Then lays on the floor, on his back.

                       ZACK
          I like it.

Kurt looks toward the hallway. Where is Brenda? Then he
shrugs and lays down beside Zack.

                       KURT
          I’m Kurt.

                    ZACK
          I’m Zack.
              (a beat)
          I wanna be a black truck driver.

                       KURT
          A what??

Suddenly Brenda’s mom steps into the doorway, interrupting.

                    JENNY JO
          Ah... What he means is he wants to
          drive a black truck. Not the...
          other way around.

Kurt looks up at her from the floor. Strange moment.

                    KURT
              (awkward)
          Hi. I’m here for Brenda.

                    JENNY JO
          I figured. Otherwise I’d be, you
          know, calling the police.

                    KURT
              (chuckles)
          Right. I’m Kurt.

He starts to get up but Zack grabs his arm. Keeping him on
the floor.

                    JENNY JO
          Ok, then. I’m Jenny Jo. The mom.
                                                           21.


IN THE HALLWAY, Brenda emerges, looking somewhat presentable,
holding Jesse. She makes eye contact with her mom, like “go
away!” As they switch places, Jenny Jo takes Jess. Whispers.

                    JENNY JO (CONT'D)
          Is that “the guy”? He’s cute!

Brenda shoos her away, then hovers by the bathroom door.
Peeks in, listening as Kurt and Zack talk.

                    KURT
          I’m gonna play in the NFL one day.

                    ZACK
          What’s that?

                    KURT
          The National Football League.

                    ZACK
          What’s that?

                    KURT
          It’s a game. That I love to play.
          And if you’re good enough, you can
          play in the NFL.

                    ZACK
          Are you good enough?

                    KURT
          Yeah. Just need a chance.

                    ZACK
          I need a chance.

                     KURT
          To what?

                     ZACK
          Drive my truck. We could drive to
          your game.

They start to get up. Brenda jolt, makes for the kitchen.
Kurt emerges with Zack tugging on his hand. Brenda pretends
she wasn’t eavesdropping.

                    KURT
          Fixed the radio.

                    BRENDA
          Oh, thanks. We have one in every
          room. It helps Zack--
                    (MORE)
                                                        22.

                    BRENDA (CONT'D)
              (shakes her head, anyway)
          Ok, can I just be blunt?

                    KURT
          Why stop now?

                    BRENDA
          How do you know where I live?

                    KURT
          Oh. Friend from the bar.

                    BRENDA
          And... WHY are you here?

                    KURT
          I wanted to meet your kids. Oh
          and....

He holds up the rose. She takes it. Perplexed and intrigued.
Zack still holds Kurt’s hand, swaying back and forth.

                    ZACK
          Come on, Mark.

Kurt frowns, looks to Brenda. Mark??

                    BRENDA
              (shrugs)
          Ex-boyfriend. Don’t ask. Listen, I
          can’t really -- I gotta get Zack to
          physical therapy... I should go.

                    KURT
          Physical therapy?

                    BRENDA
          Yeah he’s...
              (looks at him like “can’t
               you tell?”)
          He’s legally blind and is... well,
          on his own journey.

                    KURT
          Oh. Didn’t notice.

For some reason, that blows her away.

                     BRENDA
          But he’s gonna show the world what
          he can do.
                                                             23.


                         KURT
               I believe it. Well... I’ll let you
               go.

     He heads for the door. Zack holds Brenda’s hand, too and Kurt
     gets far enough away where he has to let go. It’s a moment.


23   EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - DAY

     Kurt steps outside. Brenda joins him. She hands him a napkin.
     On it --

                         BRENDA
               My number. So maybe call first next
               time. Where’s your car?

                         KURT
               Oh. I walked.

                         BRENDA
               From UNI? That’s like three miles.

                         KURT
               Yeah. Worth it!

     He smiles, holding up the napkin. Then turns and walks away.
     She watches him go. Mind spinning.


24   EXT. UNI STADIUM - DAY

     WHAM! Kurt goes down in another “Kill Kurt” drill. But this
     time he gets off a beautiful pass before being CRUSHED. He
     hops up, clapping. YES!

                         MIKE HUDNUTT
               Why you grinnin’ like an idiot?

                         KURT
               Let’s do it again. Come on guys!
               Again!

     Other players step up. Coach Allen watches from a distance.


25   EXT. UNI STADIUM - GAME DAY

     GAME TIME. The opposition prepares to PUNT.

     ON THE SIDELINES, Kurt is in his familiar spot, keeping the
     bench warm. He eyes the Coach, watching him argue with the
     STARTING QB. Suddenly, in frustration, Coach calls out:
                                                          24.


                    COACH ALLEN
          Warner! Next series is yours.

The other QB huffs away. Kurt double-takes.

                    KURT
          Me?!

                    COACH ALLEN
          Any other Warners out here?

                    KURT
          No. Yeah..... Great!

Kurt hops up, heads for the sideline. Coach stops him.

                    COACH
          You’ll need that.

Points to Kurt’s helmet. Still on the bench. Kurt grabs it.

FIRST DOWN. Kurt takes the hike. Drops back, surveys. The
pocket collapses and he gets SACKED. He gets up and looks at
Coach.

SECOND DOWN. Kurt HANDS OFF. The D LINE suffocates the
tailback for a loss.

THIRD DOWN. Kurt drops back, surveys coverage. NOTHING. And
here they come. The pocket collapses -- AND KURT RETREATS.

He darts left towards the sideline. Looking across the field
as he goes...

JUST BEFORE he runs out of bounds he leaps and throws across
his body to the OTHER SIDE of the field. Fifty yards later a
WIDE RECIEVER catches it for a TOUCHDOWN. A PERFECT and
IMPOSSIBLE throw. The crowd goes WILD. The STARTING QB is NOT
happy. But the other players gape.

Even Coach raises an eyebrow. Kurt BASKS in the moment.

                    KURT
          What I tell you, Coach?

                    COACH ALLEN
          Still didn’t stay in the damn
          pocket.

                    KURT
          Got it done, though, didn’t I?
                                                             25.


26   EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - NIGHT

     Brenda sits on the couch in a rare moment of peace and quiet.
     She looks out the window to her father LARRY (60s), a large
     blue collar man, mowing the grass. Zack rides on his
     shoulders, loving every minute of it.

     The phone RINGS. Brenda pulls it over by the cord. Answers.

                         BRENDA
               Hello?

                         KURT (V.O.)
               Hey there. I’m starting! Next week!
               It’s Kurt by the way. Warner.

     KURT IN HIS APARTMENT. CROSS CUT.

                         KURT
               You get my messages?

                         BRENDA
               Yeah. All of them.

                         KURT
               See, I called first. Good, right?

                         BRENDA
               Very impressed.

                         KURT
               I wanted to tell you, we won this
               weekend. 27, 12. I had fourteen
               completions, 300 yards.

                         BRENDA
               Wow. That’s a lot of numbers.

                         KURT
               Good numbers. So let’s celebrate.
               Monday night. On a... date?

                         BRENDA
               Yeah, what are we gonna do, walk?

                         KURT
               Is that a yes? Sounds like a yes.
               Hello?

     Brenda hangs up, smirking.
                                                               26.


30   INT. KURT AND MIKE HUDNUTT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Kurt labels a folder “Project NFL.” Stuffed with research on
     teams, contacts, etc. Then pins a “DAYS TO THE DRAFT”
     calendar on the wall. Marking a day off. Eyeing the DAY OF
     DESTINY, months away. He calls out --

                         KURT
               Hey Hud... I need a favor!


27   EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - AFTERNOON

     Kurt pulls up to Brenda’s driveway in Hudnutt’s monster
     truck. He HONKS and waits. Brenda steps out, confused.

                         BRENDA
               What are you doing?

                         KURT
               Got us a ride!

                         BRENDA
               Kurt, I can’t. I have the kids.

                         KURT
               You’re gonna make this really
               difficult, aren’t you.


28   EXT. DRIVE-IN - DUSK

     The truck is parked backwards with the bed open towards the
     giant screen. Zack is in the drivers seat, pretending to
     drive the truck. ‘The Sandlot’ plays loud over the stereo.

     Kurt and Brenda sit in the back. Legs dangling from the truck
     bed. Jesse is asleep beside them on a pile of blankets.

                         KURT
               So, you were a Marine?
                   (off her look)
               I saw the pictures.

     She nods, a little guarded.

                         BRENDA
               That feels like another life...
               That I don’t really wanna talk
               about.

     Kurt just nods. Silent. Comfortable.
                                                        27.


                    BRENDA (CONT'D)
          It’s.... kinda like a country song,
          you know? Starts out great, then
          everything goes to hell.

                    KURT
          Well, you know I love country
          music. Come on...

He gives her a look. A nod. A challenge. She meets his gaze.
Sighs.

                    BRENDA
          Where do I even start...
              (finding her way)
          When I was maybe twelve, after
          church this woman walks up to me
          and says, “there’s something really
          special about you, Brenda. God is
          gonna do something great with you.”
          And I... had the audacity to
          believe her. So I had this dream of
          becoming a Marine and marrying a
          Marine and having little Marine
          children. God and country all the
          way. So I signed up. Right outa
          high school.

                    KURT
          What’d your parents think of that?

                    BRENDA
          We... had some discussions. I won.
          Always do. Shipped off to Boot
          camp, defined myself. And then....
          I met Neil. Perfect Marine. We were
          the perfect couple. Whirlwind
          romance. Marriage. I’m 20 years old
          at the time. Zack was born a year
          later.
              (wants to stop)
          Why am I telling you this?

                    KURT
          Because you trust me.

                    BRENDA
          Do I?

Kurt grins.

                    KURT
          So... was Zack born blind?
                                                        28.


Brenda hesitates, self-conscious again. Clearly not used to
opening up. And not quite sure why she’s doing it now. But --

                    BRENDA
          No... he wasn’t. Neil ah... dropped
          him when he was four months old. We
          rushed to the hospital, where we
          were told he suffered a traumatic
          brain injury and would be lucky to
          survive the night.
              (with difficulty)
          It was an accident. Just one of
          those things. And I wasn’t even
          there. You know how helpless that
          feels?

Kurt just sits silent. Listening intently. Brenda goes off
into a thousand yard stare.

                    BRENDA (CONT'D)
          I remember praying and praying and
          begging God in that hospital to
          save my baby boy. And he did.
          Doctors said his brain was like
          Swiss cheese. First of all, who
          says that? Who tells a mother
          that?? They said he would never
          walk, and yet...
              (she smiles)
          That he would never talk, and now I
          can’t get him to stop.

Kurt nods to Zack in the driver’s seat.

                    KURT
          That he would never be a black
          truck driver?

Brenda LAUGHS.

                    BRENDA
          He always finds a way to prove
          everyone wrong. And he’s the love
          of my life.
              (gathers)
          Then, from bad to worse, when I was
          eight months pregnant with this
          one, Neil decided to cheat on me.
          So... yeah. I have trust issues.
          I’ve been hurt. You gonna hurt me,
          Kurt Warner?
              (they share a gaze)
          Told you my life’s a country song.
                                                             29.


                            KURT
               I’m sorry.

                         BRENDA
               Don’t be... Look what it got me.
                   (looks to Jesse and Zack)
               Sometimes beauty comes from ashes.

                         KURT
               So... you still believe her? That
               church lady?

     Brenda shrugs, bittersweet. Honest.

                         BRENDA
               I’m tryin’.


29   EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kurt parks the truck. Walks Brenda to the house. Jesse asleep
     in one of his arms, holding Zack’s hand with the other.
     Brenda can’t help but notice.

     ON THE PORCH, Brenda’s parents wait for them. Larry wears a
     factory uniform, all blue collar grit. Jenny Jo smiles.

                         JENNY JO
               Well, hey there!

                         BRENDA
               Hi. Kurt, this is my dad.

                         KURT
               Hello, sir.

     As Larry nods, Zack runs to him.

                            ZACK
               Papa!

     Brenda’s older sister KIM pops her head out. Admiring Kurt.

                         KIM
               Well hi there.

                         BRENDA
               Alright, back off. That’s my
               sister.

                         KIM
                   (to Kurt)
               Don’t worry, I’m married.
                                                           30.


Kurt smirks. Brenda swats everyone away.

                    BRENDA
          Go! All of you.

Mom takes Jesse and they go inside, leaving Brenda and Kurt
alone. Kurt steps close. Brenda goes a bit quiet.

                    BRENDA (CONT'D)
          So... I’m trying to imagine a
          scenario where any of this works.

                    KURT
          What exactly?

                    BRENDA
          You know? Us.

                    KURT
              (grinning)
          We’re an ‘Us’? Great news!

Brenda rolls her eyes.

                    BRENDA
          You’re a jock. I hate jocks.
          And you’re in college, Kurt, and
          I’m.... not. And I’ve got two kids
          and -- This is crazy.
              (gazes at him)
          It’s... not gonna work.

                    KURT
          You keep saying that.

                    BRENDA
          I just don’t want... I can’t... We
          should just...

And suddenly she KISSES HIM. Kurt is caught off guard for a
beat. Then he wraps his arms around her and kisses her back.
A long, potent kiss.

Finally they pull away. Brenda catches her breath. Then:

                    KURT
          So. Tomorrow night?

                    BRENDA
          Yeah.
                                                             31.


31   EXT. STADIUM - DAY

     Packed crowd. TONS OF ENERGY. Students, cheerleaders, fans.

     ON THE FIELD. Kurt steps to the LINE in slow mo. Loving it.
     Ball in hand. He surveys. Takes a breath. HIKE!


32   INT. WILD E. COYOTE BAR - NIGHT

     The bar is packed. Everyone’s eyes on the TV, watching the
     game. Where Kurt is dominating. Brenda sits at the bar. Glued
     to the screen.

                         ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
               ...Warner continues to break
               records, with 5 touchdowns today
               and over 400 yards in the air...

     ON THE TV: Kurt drops back. Let’s it fly. TOUCHDOWN! The bar
     erupts. Brenda CHEERS. OFF THIS --


33   INT. KURT AND MIKE HUDNUTT'S APARTMENT - DAY

     ...NOW THE FOOTAGE PLAYS ON KURT’S TV. As he cuts together a
     new DEMO REEL. He ejects the tape. Labels it. Then looks to
     his DRAFT calendar.

     “DAY OF DESTINY” is just two months away.


     INT. KURT AND MIKE HUDNUTT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Kurt holds the phone to his ear. Talking to a sports agent,
     RICH. Brenda and Hudnutt listen.

                         KURT
                   (into phone)
               A few agents looked at me. Towards
               the end of the season. And I hit up
               Pro-Day at a couple other schools.
               We’re... too small to have one.

     Brenda leans into the phone. Her face close to his. He kisses
     her quick. Mike snaps his finger and points, like “FOCUS!”.

                         RICH (O.S.)
               Six two, two twenty. Didn’t start
               till Year 5.... Why?
                                                                32.


                         KURT
               Ah... Late bloomer? But I was
               Gateway player of the year. And our
               team was first in conference.

                          RICH (O.S.)
               Didn’t seem to help your team in
               the playoffs.
                   (beat)
               Look, it’s rare that a 1AA player
               gets drafted...

     Kurt and Brenda hold their breath. Waiting. Now Mike leans
     in, too.

                         RICH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               But let’s see what we can do.

                         KURT
               Great! Thank you. I--

                         RICH (O.S.)
               Gotta grab this. Look forward to
               it.

     CLICK. Kurt looks to Brenda and Mike, in shock.

                         KURT
               I GOT AN AGENT!

     He PUMPS his fist and they all SCREAM.


36   EXT. KURT’S MOM’S HOME - CEDAR RAPIDS - DAY

     Kurt pulls up to his childhood home in Hudnutt’s black truck.
     Mom greets him on the porch, excited. Quick hug.

                            SUE
               Draft day!


37   INT. KURT'S MOM'S HOME - CEDAR RAPIDS - DAY

     ESPN coverage plays on TV. Mom puts out a bowl of chips.

                         KURT
               Good thing you have cable, or I
               wouldn’t even know if I got picked.

                         SUE
               Feeling confident?
                                                           33.


                    KURT
          Feeling nervous.

LATER. Kurt paces, on the phone with his Dad.

                    GENE (ON PHONE)
          ...Heck yeah, I’m watching.
          Wouldn’t miss it.

                    KURT
          Thanks, Dad. Hey, I better go, it’s
          about to start.

There’s a KNOCK at the door. Sue opens it to find --
BRENDA AND ZACK.

Kurt jolts, surprised. Zack barrels to him. Sue watches this
little disabled boy run into her house, then she nods at
Brenda. A bit cold.

                     KURT (CONT'D)
          Hey, babe.
              (shifts)
          Mom, this is Brenda. And Zack.

                    BRENDA
          Surprise. Thought you might like
          some extra support.

                    SUE
          Hello, there.

                    BRENDA
          Hi! Great to meet you. Kurt’s told
          me all about you.

                    SUE
          How nice. He hasn’t said much about
          you.

Kurt cringes a little. Instant tension.

THEY SETTLE ON THE COUCH as the draft starts. Zack walks
right up to the TV, squints with his good eye.

                    KURT
          Sit with me, Z-man. This is where
          they pick the people who get to
          play football.

                    ZACK
          Pick Kurt. Pick KURT!
                                                           34.


                    BRENDA
              (whispering)
          Quiet down, Zack.

Kurt looks from Brenda to his mom. Sue’s disapproval is
obvious. And here’s Kurt, literally stuck in the middle.

ON THE TV - music and graphic play. Everyone HUSHES. Zack
plops into Kurt’s lap. He can’t see the screen, he’s just
excited to be part of it.

Then PAUL TAGLIABUE, COMMISSIONER OF THE NFL, begins:

                    TAGLIABUE (ON SCREEN)
          For the first pick of the 1994
          draft, the Cincinnati Bengals have
          picked -- Dan Wilkinson, defensive
          tackle.

                    ZACK
          Pick KURT!!

Brenda SHUSHES him again.

                    KURT
          Ok, it’s okay. I probably won’t be
          called before tomorrow.

                      BRENDA
          Tomorrow?

                    KURT
          Yeah. There’s seven rounds of
          picks, spread over two days. If...
          when... I’m picked it’ll be the
          later rounds.

                    BRENDA
          Oh. Tomorrow is Zack’s birthday.
          We’re having a party. At the house.
          Remember?

Kurt waves it off.

                    KURT
          Right. Yeah, that’s fine. You start
          the party. I’ll stop by as soon as
          this is over.
              (grins optimistically)
          We can celebrate everything
          together.
                                                             35.


38   INT. KURT'S MOM'S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     LATER. Sue does dishes, watching through the window as Kurt
     helps Brenda load Zack into her old Buick Regal.

     MOMENTS LATER, Kurt enters the kitchen. Sue glances at him.

                         SUE
               Sure that’s a good idea?

                         KURT
               What?

                          SUE
               Single mom, two kids, it’s no joke.
               I would know.
                   (beat)
               That’s the life you really want?

     She hands him a plate to dry. On Kurt... hesitating.


37   INT. KURT'S MOM'S HOME - CEDAR RAPIDS - DAY

     THE NEXT DAY, Kurt sits alone. Glued to the TV. As...

     ON THE SCREEN: They announce the LAST pick of the draft. Not
     Kurt Warner.

     ON HIS FACE, as it sets it.


39   INT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - EVENING

     Zack’s birthday party. It’s a small affair. Just Brenda and
     her parents, Kim and JOHN (Kim’s husband), little Jesse, and
     a few of Zack’s preschool friends.

     Kurt enters, clearly late. Brenda looks to him. Wondering...
     Kurt shakes his head. Brenda slumps sympathetically.

                         KURT
               Sorry I’m so late. I just had to
               watch to the end.

     She tries to hug him. But he shrugs it off. It stings, but
     Brenda pivots to Zack.

                         BRENDA
               He’s been asking about you. Didn’t
               want to do the cake until you’re
               here.

     Zack runs over. Kurt perks up for him.
                                                             36.


                         KURT
               Happy birthday, Z-man!

                         ZACK
               Want cake?!

                         KURT
               Of course I do.

     LATER. Everyone chats, Larry runs Zack around the house on
     his shoulders. Kurt sits off on his own, poking at a piece of
     cake. Dejected. Brenda approaches.

                           BRENDA
               You okay?

     But he’s off in his own world.

                         KURT
               Fine. Think I’m gonna head out.

     And he walks out. Brenda watches him go, disappointed. Then
     thinks better of it and follows.


40   EXT. BRENDA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     She chases Kurt into the driveway.

                         BRENDA
               Yeah? Just like that? Just gonna
               run off?

                         KURT
               What do you want me to say, Brenda?

                         BRENDA
               You know. Dreams don’t always look
               like you think they will.

                         KURT
               Yeah. Well looks like mine is over.
               So.

                         BRENDA
               Stop it. Hey. You know the motto of
               the Marines?

     Kurt turns.

                           KURT
               What?
                                                             37.


                         BRENDA
               Semper Fidelis. It means “always
               faithful”. It means never give up.
               Never quit. So if this is your
               dream, what do you need to do, Kurt
               Warner?

     Kurt looks at her, surprised. But it’s working, she’s getting
     through. Brenda continues, firm.

                          BRENDA (CONT'D)
               Cause I don’t think you’re gonna
               let this stop you. Just because
               it’s hard. That’s not the man that
               I....
                   (beat)
               ...that I’m....into. A little.

     ON KURT. Deciding.


41   INT. BRENDA’S BUICK REGAL - DAY

     Brenda drives. Kurt’s next to her, in his UNI sweats. Upbeat.
     Revving himself up.

                         KURT
               It’s gonna be ok. Gonna be great.
               GREAT. I’m a free agent now. Teams
               are still filling out their
               rosters, I could still get a call.

                         BRENDA
               Great. So you keep working out,
               don’t let this slow you down.

                         KURT
               Exactly... Hey, left! Gym's over
               there! Turn left.

                         BRENDA
               Can’t do that.

     She TURNS RIGHT.

                          KURT
               What?

                         BRENDA
               Car won’t turn left. I’m serious.
               It just dies.

                         KURT
               But the gym’s that way.
                                                                38.


                         BRENDA
               Listen fella, if you turn right,
               and right, and right again, you can
               get just about anywhere.
                   (grinning)
               Sometimes you just gotta find
               another way.


42   INT. CEDAR FALLS DINER - NIGHT

     Kurt tears into one of THREE CHEESEBURGERS on his plate.
     Slurps a chocolate shake. NFL Folder open before him.

     He’s buried in STATS of various NFL franchises. Brenda just
     smirks. Admiring him.

                         KURT
               What?

                         BRENDA
               You’re cute when you’re focused.

     Then A VOICE interrupts:

                         VOICE (O.C.)
               Kurt Warner! I have been looking
               everywhere for YOU.

     It’s a wondrous cross between a used car salesman and a
     revival tent preacher. Kurt and Brenda spin on their stools
     to face:

                         JIM FOSTER
               Jim Foster. It is my absolute
               pleasure to meet you.

     JIM FOSTER (late 40s) shakes Kurt’s hand up and down. Then
     bows to Brenda.

                         JIM FOSTER (CONT'D)
               And you are?

                         BRENDA
               Brenda.

                         JIM FOSTER
               Pleasure to meet you. Did you know,
               Brenda, that you’re datin’ the best
               damn quarterback in the whole state
               of Iowa?

                         BRENDA
               So he tells me.
                                                        39.


                    JIM FOSTER
          You don’t believe him? You should,
          cause it’s true. Can I sit?
              (he does anyway)
          Look. The elephant in the room. Sorry
          about the draft. But you have it all,
          kid. The whole package. The world
          just needs more time to see it.

                    KURT
              (to Brenda)
          See, he gets it.

                    JIM FOSTER
          Yes. I do! And what if I told you
          starting tomorrow you have a job
          playing the game you love?

                    KURT
          You a scout or something?

                    JIM FOSTER
          No... I am the proud owner and head
          coach of the Iowa Barnstormers!
          Newest members of the Arena
          Football League.

                    KURT
              (deflates)
          Right. You’re the guy who invented
          that whole arena concept.

                    JIM FOSTER
          Last year I was commissioner of the
          league. This year, I came home to
          Iowa to start my own team. And I
          want to build it around YOU.

Foster plops down a brochure for the Barnstormers. Cheesy and
small time in every way.

                    BRENDA
          So it’s arena... football?

                    KURT
          It’s not football babe, it’s more
          like a circus.

                    JIM FOSTER
          YES! That’s right. You get it!
          People LOVE the circus.

                    BRENDA
          I like the circus.
                                                                40.


                         KURT
               I play FOOTBALL. And I’m gonna play
               in the NFL. This is for guys...
               circling the drain.

                         JIM FOSTER
               Tell you what, just think about it.
                   (to Brenda)
               Get him to think about it. Here’s
               my card.

     Foster drops four $20 bills on the table. Then he leaves,
     giving one more thumbs up out the door. Brenda looks at the
     cash on the table, gives Kurt a look.

                         KURT
               It’s all the way in Des Moines,
               Brenda. And it’s NOT football.


43   INT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kurt and Brenda enter. Arms full with diapers and milk.

                         KURT
               We did it! We got the Regal to turn
               left! Just gotta throw it in
               neutral.

     Larry, Jenny Jo and Zack sit around the dinner table.

                         JENNY JO
               Saved you some food.

                         KURT
               Actually just ate.... But sure.

     He digs into the roast and potatoes. Doesn’t notice that
     everyone is staring at him, until...

     Larry clears his throat. Jenny Jo smiles. They trade looks,
     like there’s a joke Kurt isn’t in on.

                         LARRY
               How’dya think the Bears will do
               this season, son?

                         KURT
               Well, they fired Ditka. Probably
               gonna get worse before...

     He stops mid-sentence, drops his fork. Looks to Larry.
                                                             41.


                         KURT (CONT'D)
               Did they call? Are you kidding me?!
               Did somebody from the Bears call
               here?!

     Larry shakes his head, acting despondent.

                         LARRY
               No, they didn’t call. I’m sorry...

     A LONG BEAT as Larry milks it for all it’s worth. Finally:

                         LARRY (CONT'D)
               The PACKERS called. They want to
               sign you.

     Kurt’s eyes go WIDE. Jumps from his chair. Everyone YELLS all
     at once. Off this, we CUT TO:

     A CONTRACT. As Kurt signs his name. We pull out to reveal
     we’re in:


44   INT/EXT. GMC CAR DEALERSHIP - DAY

     It’s not a sports contract, he’s signing the title documents
     for a new car. A SALESMAN hands him the keys to a brand new,
     GREEN ‘93 GMC Jimmy.

     Brenda and Hudnutt are along for moral support. Kurt beams.

                         KURT
               $5000 signing bonus, baby! Pretty
               great, huh? And it’s green...
                   (waiting for their reaction)
               For Packers. Green Bay. Get it?

                         BRENDA
               Yeah, no we get it.

                         KURT
               Packer for life, baby!

                         HUDNUTT
               We get it, Kurt.

                         KURT
               That’s why it’s green.


     INT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT

     Kurt and Brenda lay on the couch in the dark, kissing. Kurt
     grins at her.
                                                                42.


                         KURT
               So how does it feel to make out
               with a professional athlete?

                          BRENDA
                   (beat)
               It was better before you said that.

     Kurt laughs, kisses her again, pulls his shirt over his head.
     Just then... THE FRONT DOOR OPENS. Brenda’s mom steps in.

                         JENNY JO
               I have groceries.... Why are the
               lights out?

     Kurt bolts up. Shoot! He looks around -- nowhere to go. So he
     runs for the WINDOW. Brenda tries to stop him, but he climbs
     out into the yard like a busted teenager, pulling his shirt
     on and tripping over his shoes. Brenda calls after him.

                          BRENDA
               Yeah, run away, football player.
               Really impressive!
                   (then)
               Hi, Mom.


45   EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - DAY

     Kurt is packed and ready to go. Shakes hands with Larry.
     Gives Jenny Jo a hug. He bends down, picks up Zack.

     Zack hugs Kurt extra tight. Clearly emotional:

                         ZACK
               Bye, bye, Kurt. Do good.

     Jesse FUSSES in Brenda’s arms. Brenda hands her to Mom and
     they all go inside, leaving Brenda and Kurt to say goodbye.

     She kisses him. Deep.

                         KURT
               You ever feel like your whole life
               has been leading to one moment?

                         BRENDA
               Then go make the most of it.

     He looks into her eyes. Sees a tinge of something, maybe
     fear. Something is off.

                           KURT
               You okay?
                                                                43.


                         BRENDA
               Yeah. I’m really happy for you...
                   (carefully)
               Look, I know what this means. For
               you, your life - it’s gonna change.
               It’ll get busier, and bigger...

                         KURT
               Brenda. Hey. We’ll figure it out.

     She nods. Steeling herself. But won’t make eye contact.
     Processing.

                         BRENDA
               Yeah, we’ll figure it out.

     Finally, she looks into his eyes. One last kiss and Kurt
     climbs into his truck. Brenda watches him drive away.


46   EXT. HIGHWAY - WISCONSIN - DAY

     Kurt’s new truck speeds through lush green Wisconsin farmland.


47   EXT. ST. NORBERT STADIUM - DAY

     Kurt step into the stadium, where dozens of players warm up.
     BRETT FAVRE sprays bullets around the field. Kurt’s jaw drops.

                           KURT
               Wow.

     He spots REGGIE WHITE getting stretched out by a trainer.

                         KURT (CONT'D)
               Hey! Minister of defense. This
               is... SO cool!

     Reggie looks over.

                           REGGIE
               Hey, kid.

     Kurt puts out his hand, geeking out. But Reggie is mid-
     stretch. Not really a good moment to shake.

                         REGGIE (CONT'D)
               Can’t really.

                         KURT
               Oh yeah, sorry.
                                                                44.


     Kurt ends up sort of patting Reggie on the head. It’s really
     weird. Reggie just chuckles. Kurt shakes his head,
     humiliated. Such an idiot.

     QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS, as Kurt is put through the wringer
     with the other recruits. 7 on 7 drills, warm ups, laps, etc.

     Kurt lines up behind center. Takes the snap, but before he can
     look up, he’s rushed. Panicked, he throws... an incomplete.

                         KURT (CONT'D)
               Damn, this is really fast.

                         REGGIE
               Welcome to the NFL.

     He pats Kurt on the head the same weird way and walks off.

     LATER, Kurt stands on the sideline, brow furrowed from
     reading the THICK PLAYBOOK.

                         VOICE (O.C.)
               Hey Pop! Pop Warner!

     It’s the quarterbacks coach, STEVE “MOOCH” MARIUCCI (30’s).
     Kurt hustles over.

                            COACH MOOCH
               You’re in.

     Kurt immediately starts backpedaling.

                         KURT
               Ah, Coach... I just got here. I
               don’t really know the playbook
               yet...

                         COACH MOOCH
               You don’t want to go in?

                         KURT
               Yeah. No, I just... Don’t wanna
               blow it out there. I’ll have it all
               down tomorrow.

                         COACH MOOCH
                   (moving on)
               Detmer! You’re in.


48   INT. MOOCH’S OFFICE - DAY

     Kurt enters Coach Mooch’s office. Mooch shakes his hand.
                                                               45.


                         KURT
               You wanted to see me?

                         COACH MOOCH
               Yeah. Thanks for coming, Warner.
               Wish you well.

     Kurt stops. Confused.

                         KURT
               Wait. What?

                         COACH MOOCH
               We’re letting you go.

                         KURT
               I don’t understand. I just got
               here. You guys didn’t even see me
               play.

                         COACH MOOCH
               We saw enough.

                         KURT
               No. I’m sorry, sir, but... I’m not
               leaving. Not yet. You can’t cut me.

                         COACH MOOCH
               You cut yourself.

                         KURT
               Coach, please, I’ve worked my whole
               life for this--

                         COACH MOOCH
               You know how many times I’ve heard
               that? If it was true you’d have
               been ready to go on that field.
               You’re not. Good luck, son.


49   EXT. STADIUM TUNNEL - DAY

     AT A PAYPHONE, Kurt is mid-conversation with his agent.

                         KURT
               I don’t know, you’re the agent. I
               mean what about Tampa Bay, San
               Diego? There were other offers.
               Can’t you make some calls?

                         RICH (O.S.)
               Teams are making cuts, not looking
               to add players.
                         (MORE)
                                                             46.

                         RICH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               And definitely not players like
               you. I just don’t see a path
               forward. Sorry.

     As that settles....


     INT. KURT’S TRUCK - DAY

     Kurt drives back, numb. Passes the sign “WELCOME TO IOWA”.

                         KURT (PRE-LAP)
               I don’t know what to do.


50   EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT

     Brenda sits with Kurt. Her hand in his.

                         KURT
               I’ve called every team in the NFL
               and no one is interested. I wanna
               keep going, I do. But... look at
               me. I’m unemployed, I’m homeless...
                   (off her look)
               Oh yeah, Hudnutt’s movin’ to Des
               Moines.

     Brenda processes this. Gets a thought.

                         BRENDA
               Then... move in.

                           KURT
               What?

                         BRENDA
               With us. My family.

     He looks at her. You kidding?

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
               I’m starting nursing school. Could
               use a live in nanny. We’re both
               gonna be struggling, so...

                         KURT
               Let’s struggle together?

                         BRENDA
               Yeah. Together.

                         KURT
               What’s your mom gonna think?
                                                             47.


                         BRENDA
               It’s your mom I’m worried about.
               That woman hates me!

     They laugh.


51   INT. BASEMENT - DAY

     Kurt carries boxes to the basement. Followed by Larry, with a
     port-a-crib. Then Brenda, hefting a mini-fridge. There’s a
     carpet on one side, with a full-sized bed. Couch and a tv.

                         KURT
               Thank you. For taking me in. Just a
               temporary --

                         JENNY JO
               You’ll be sleeping on the couch,
               right?

     Larry waves it off. But Jenny Jo is clearly uncomfortable
     with this. Kurt shoots Brenda a look. Told you.

                         LARRY
               We’re happy to have you. Stay as
               long as you like.

                         BRENDA
               Gotta run to class. I’ll be home
               late. Zack comes at 3. Baby’s
               sleeping.

                         KURT
               I got this. Go!


52   INT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Zack and Kurt sit on the couch together watching football on
     TV, eating mac and cheese. Both of them loving it.

                           ZACK
               Football!

                         KURT
               Yeah Z-Man, you like it?

                         ZACK
               How come you’re not playing?

                         KURT
               I didn’t get picked.
                                                                48.


     Zack nods thoughtfully. Scratches at his eyebrow. Swaying
     back and forth.

                         ZACK
               I pick you.

     He holds up one of his trucks. Kurt’s face fills with love
     for this kid. He takes the truck and they start playing.


53   EXT. LONG STRETCH OF WHEAT FIELD - SUNRISE

     Kurt runs and runs, pushing himself. The sun rising behind
     him.

     LATER, he throws a worn football over and over. Keeping his
     arm up. He’s not giving up.


56   INT. HY-VEE SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

     The same market Kurt and Mike shopped at earlier on. The
     cashier rings Kurt up. Diapers. Cereal. Etc.

                         CASHIER
               Twenty-seven twelve.

     Kurt opens his wallet, feeling the strain.

                         KURT
               Hey, you uh... take food stamps?

     The cashier eyes him, nods reluctantly. Kurt hands over an
     EBT card. Then he spots a NOW HIRING sign in the window.

                         CASHIER
               Anything else for ya?

                         KURT
               No, that’s it.

     He heads for the exit. Then stops, doubles back.

                         KURT (CONT'D)
               Actually. Ummm... can I get an
               application?


57   INT. THE BASEMENT - NIGHT

     The basement door opens. Brenda peeks down to find:
                                                             49.


     Kurt, laid out on the carpet, Zack in his arms. Both of them
     stone cold asleep. Zack has built a whole racetrack up and
     around Kurt’s body, like Gulliver’s Travels.

     Brenda admires them for a moment. Then gently picks up Zack
     to put him to bed. Kurt stirs. Takes a breath. Opens one eye.

                         KURT
               Hey, mama. Got a job today.

                         BRENDA
               Yeah? Where?

                         KURT
               Stocking shelves at the Hy-Vee.
               Graveyard shift.

     Brenda nods thoughtfully.

                         BRENDA
               That must have been hard.

                         KURT
               Guess sometimes you gotta do what
               you gotta do... while you’re
               waiting to do what you’re meant to
               do.

     He manages a genuine smile, and her heart fills with
     admiration for this man. Off this:

                         WEARY TEACHER (PRE-LAP)
               You need to re-set your
               expectations.


58   INT. KINDERGARTER CLASSROOM - DAY

     Kurt sits with Brenda in tiny plastic kindergarten chairs.
     Facing off with a WEARY TEACHER. Larry leans against the
     wall, off to the side. Brenda is already worked up.

                         WEARY TEACHER
               Most retarded children require a
               special learning environ...

                         BRENDA
               Hey! Zack is NOT retarded. Don’t
               call him that.
                                                                50.


                         WEARY TEACHER
               He’s... developmentally disabled.
               In my experience, he won’t be able
               to keep up with his classmates,
               and... frankly, you shouldn’t
               expect him to.

                         KURT
               But we do. We DO expect him to.
               Look. Miss... Causey. Zack likes
               this school, he likes this class.
               We know what he’s capable of, and
               we’re not just gonna pull him out
               the moment things get a little
               hard.

                         WEARY TEACHER
               We may not have that choice. If he
               falls too far behind...

                          KURT
               Tell you what. We’ll make sure he
               doesn’t, how’s that sound?
                   (firm)
               You do your job, we’ll do ours.

     Brenda exchanges a look with her father. Larry raises an
     eyebrow. Damn.


59   INT. BRENDA’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Kurt works with Zack -- drawing letters on a Magna-Doodle.
     Zack is determined. But having trouble.

     Brenda peeks in. Kurt writes something on the board.

                         KURT
               Can you read that?

     Zack squints with his good eye. He can’t.

                         ZACK
               What’s it say?

                         BRENDA
                   (steps closer, reading)
               “I love your Mama.”

     She looks to Kurt, surprised. Then rolls her eyes.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
               Really? THIS is how you’re gonna
               tell me you love me?
                                                                51.


     Kurt grins boyishly. What?? She just shakes her head and
     walks out. As she goes...

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
               And yeah, when you stood up for him
               today... That was super hot.


60   INT. HY-VEE SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

     Kurt wears a clerk’s apron, stocking groceries.

     A WOMAN and her SON (10) push a cart past. She spots Kurt and
     pauses. Whispers to her kid, who wears a UNI jersey.
     Obviously recognizing him. Then her surprise turns to pity.

     Kurt sees. Trying to shrug it off. But it stings.


61   INT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

     Kurt enters, just as THE SUN RISES. Weary, he strips off his
     apron. BEYOND tired.

     Morning rush hour. Brenda hurries to make a bag lunch. Her
     mom feeds the kids.

                         BRENDA
               Gotta go. Back tonight at seven.
               Date night?

                         KURT
               Sorry. Shift starts at 6:30.


62   EXT. STREET - MORNING

     Kurt runs the streets. Still training. Still believing. But
     WORN the hell down.


63   INT. HYVEE SUPERMARKET - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

     Cereal aisle. Kurt unpacks boxes of WHEATIES, each one with
     the FACE of Dan Marino on it. He stares at Dan’s face. Like
     “I could be that guy”.

     From down the aisle, another clerk, MARSHALL, calls out.

                         MARSHALL
               Hey, Dan Marino! Pass me some
               Wheaties.
                                                              52.


     Marshall laughs at his own joke. Kurt FLINGS a box at him,
     then grins mischievously.

                         KURT
               Awright. You wanna play? Game on!

     He pulls out a canister of Quaker Oats, then crouches behind
     a pallet like he’s under center.

                         KURT (CONT'D)
               Number 13 takes the snap, pump
               fakes to the weak side, looks
               downfield... And lets it fly!

     Marshall takes the cue, breaks long toward the seafood
     counter.

     Mr. Quaker spins in a perfect spiral toward Marshall’s
     outstretched hands. Except DEREK, the night manager, walks by
     and -- SMACK! The canister hits him right between the
     numbers, spilling wild oats everywhere. Kurt cringes.

                         KURT (CONT'D)
               I’ll get the broom.


64   EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

     The sun hasn’t yet appeared. Brenda walks out to find Kurt
     throwing a football against the garage roof, like when he was
     a kid.

     She watches him a moment. Steps up beside him.

                         BRENDA
               Wondered where you were.

     Kurt stops. Eyes on the ground. He speaks quietly.

                         KURT
               Why would God give me this dream --
               then not let me have it?

     Brenda doesn’t answer at first. Then:

                         BRENDA
               Maybe you should ask Him yourself.

                         KURT
               Yeah, I don’t really do that.

     Brenda moves closer.
                                                             53.


                         BRENDA
               Hey, listen to me. I’ve been
               through a lot, fit a lifetime of
               pain and regrets into a short
               number of years. So I know quite a
               bit about disappointment. And
               here’s what I’ve learned... Our
               struggles, they shape us. They make
               our stories unique. You really want
               to be like every other football
               player out there? With the same old
               story?

     He shakes his head.

                         KURT
               No, but I want to have a story.

                         BRENDA
               Then, what did your coach say? Stay
               in the pocket.

     Kurt takes that in. Turns to her.

                         KURT
               I just want one shot, you know?
               Just to prove...

                         BRENDA
               Prove what?

                         KURT
               That I’m good enough.

                         BRENDA
               Kurt... I don’t think a football
               game will ever be able to tell you
               that.

     He lets out a breath, wrestling with that. Still unsettled.
     As the sun breaks through.


65   EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY

     Kurt mows the lawn, Zack on his shoulders. Larry steps onto
     the porch with sweet tea. Watches them. Then:

                         LARRY
               Kurt, steal you for a second?

     LATER, they sit together out of ear shot, braving a cold fall
     wind. Zack plays in the leaves nearby. Larry’s got his buck
     knife out, whittling a toy tractor.
                                                54.


                    LARRY (CONT'D)
          We bought our dream home, son.
          Down in Arkansas, close to Jenny’s
          family. Brand new ranch house. Two
          car garage. Sitting right down the
          road from the White River. Man,
          that’s good fishin’. So... we’ll be
          leaving soon.

                    KURT
          That’s... great, Larry. Really
          happy for you.

                    LARRY
          We were gonna do it a few years
          back. But stayed because... well,
          that’s what was needed. Thing of it
          is--

                    KURT
          We’re gonna need a new place to
          live?

                    LARRY
          I was hoping you’d say “we.”
          You two are good together. Brenda’s
          all stability, you’re all dreams.
          Would be nice to see her dream
          again.
              (stops carving)
          Look, Jenny Jo would want me to ask
          this. Good Christian family, after
          all. You love her?

Without hesitation.

                    KURT
          Yes sir, I do.

                    LARRY
          Then what’s holding you back?

Kurt goes flush, but he thinks it over.

                    KURT
          I guess... I wanted to prove myself
          first. Show her I could do what I
          set out to do. Be... worthy of her.

Larry nods with respect.
                                                             55.


                         LARRY
               Hell Kurt, accomplishing one thing
               or another -- that’s not what’ll
               make you worthy of her. Life’s not
               about what you can achieve, it’s
               about who you can become. It’s a
               journey, not an event.
                   (let’s that sink in)
               Just promise me this... that you
               won’t take off when things get
               hard. And they will get hard. My
               daughter’s been through a lot
               already, I can’t watch someone
               break her heart again.

                            KURT
               Yes, sir.

     Then Larry nods to Zack, still playing in the leaves.

                         LARRY
               And take care of those kids for me.

     Kurt meets Larry’s gaze, feeling the pressure of that. He
     nods and they shake hands.


66   INT. RENTAL HOUSE - DAY

     It’s winter now. THE FRONT DOOR OPENS to a humble rental
     home. Kurt leads Brenda and the kids inside. ZACK is 6 now,
     JESSE is 2. Toddling around.

                         KURT
               Okay. We are walking through the
               front door. Ready?

                            ZACK
               Ready!

     It’s a total SLUM. Peeling paint, casement windows, and VERY
     warped floorboards.

     Zack inhales, taking in the smell. He puts his truck down,
     feels the first wall. Kurt and Brenda watch as THE TRUCK
     ROLLS DOWN THE CROOKED FLOOR TO THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.

                            ZACK (CONT'D)
               I like it!
                                                               56.


67   EXT. THE RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT

     It’s snowing. Kurt rushes in from the car to the house,
     carrying groceries.


68   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     He hands Brenda a bottle of pink antibiotics. Brenda and both
     kids huddle under the blankets on the couch, coughing and
     sneezing.

                         KURT
               How’s the fever?

                         BRENDA
               Same.

     Kurt puts groceries away, stares into the half-empty fridge.
     He shivers.

                         KURT
               What happened to the heat? Did we
               pay the bill?

                         BRENDA
               I dunno, Kurt. You said not to put
               it in the mail. Remember?

                         KURT
               Dammit.


69   INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Kurt slams a kettle on the stove. Brenda steps in behind him,
     wrapped in her robe, holding a fussing Jesse.

                         BRENDA
               I decided. I’m dropping out of
               school. Gonna get a job.

                         KURT
               No. No way.

                         BRENDA
               We can’t make it on one income at
               minimum wage. We’re buying
               groceries with food stamps and we
               still don’t have enough.

                         KURT
               I’ll take more shifts.
                                                             57.


                         BRENDA
               Kurt, it’s not working. Nothing
               here is working!

                         KURT
               You’re not going to QUIT, Brenda!

                         BRENDA
               It’s what’s NECESSARY.

                         KURT
               No, STOP IT!
                   (gathers)
               I have to believe there is
               something I can do! That I’m not...
               stuck on a bench watching a game I
               can’t change. So we are not giving
               up. Understand?

     Brenda nods, stunned. She turns and goes back to the COUGHING
     children. Kurt stands alone, barely holding it together.


70   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

     Patches of ice line the shoulders. The Jimmy speeds along a
     two-lane highway.


71   INT. THE JIMMY - SAME TIME

     Kurt stares out the window, stuck in his own head. Suddenly,
     a THUNK sounds from the engine. Kurt grips the wheel. The
     power steering is gone. The car slows.

                          BRENDA
               Kurtis?

     Kurt guides the Jimmy off to the shoulder. He stares at the
     gauges. Swears to himself.

                         KURT
               I think we’re outta gas.

     MOMENTS LATER Kurt and Brenda DIG in the seats for loose
     change. He finds a couple quarters. Moves on to the center
     compartment. Digs through wrappers and trash, excavates more
     coins. Brenda feels under her seat. Fishes out a dime.

                         KURT (CONT'D)
                   (counting)
               Grand total? One dollar and seventy
               seven cents.

                                                               58.

                         KURT (CONT'D)
               I’ll be right back, alright?
               Everything’s gonna be fine.

     Zack nods, SHIVERING.

                         BRENDA
                   (warms her hands, nervous)
               Be fast.


72   EXT. THE TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     Kurt half-runs down the road, keeping his bare hands in his
     pockets, breath visible in the freezing air.

     He reaches an intersection. Looks left, right -- no gas
     station. He glances back, worried. Then continues on.

     A COUPLE MILES LATER. His walking slows, face buried in his
     jacket. He’s exhausted, and lower than low. Finally he looks
     up and sees a sign in the distance.


73   INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

     Kurt drops all his change on the counter. The ATTENDANT
     barely looks up.

                         KURT
               A dollar seventy seven on pump
               three, please.
                   (then, realizing)
               Do you have gas cans?

                         ATTENDANT
               Yeah, five bucks.

     Kurt’s face drops. He turns to the guy, desperate.

                         KURT
               I just need to borrow a can. I’ll
               bring it back.

                         ATTENDANT
               Sorry man, it costs what it costs.

                         KURT
               Listen. My family is out there
               freezing in a car on the side of
               the road. I swear to you...
                   (reading his nametag)
               Edward, I SWEAR I will come back here
               and I will pay you back. PLEASE.
                                                               59.


     The attendant looks him over, finally relents. HE NODS.


74   EXT. THE JIMMY - NIGHT

     Kurt SPRINTS through the freezing snow, fingers numb from the
     gas can. But he refuses to slow. ON HIS FACE, genuine fear.

     He finally arrives. Rushes to the car. The windows are iced
     over. Looks like a tomb in there.

                         KURT
               Brenda?

     He pulls open the door. Brenda has both kids in her arms,
     under her coat like a blanket. They’re all SHIVERING.


75   INT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT

     Zack and Jesse are asleep in their room. Kurt shuts the door
     behind him, his face a mask of worry and self-loathing.

     IN THE LIVING ROOM, Kurt sits next to Brenda, who’s wrapped
     in a blanket in front of a propane TANK with a heater,
     GLOWING RED.

                         KURT
               You coulda died out there.

                         BRENDA
               It’s late, Kurt. Get some sleep.

     Kurt blinks back the tears.

                         KURT
               No. I promised your dad I’d take
               care of you.

                         BRENDA
               Stop.

                         KURT
               I’m a failure, Brenda. Stick with
               me and you’ll freeze to death. I
               just... try and I try and I keep
               letting everyone down. I don’t know
               why I can’t catch a break!

     Brenda turns to face him. Her voice level.

                         BRENDA
               Hey. Semper Fidelis. No quitting,
               no running away, right?
                         (MORE)
                                                              60.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
               We’ll figure it out. Together. Now
               what do you need to do?

     Kurt meets her gaze. Struck.


76   EXT. COW PASTURE PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

     One by one, HAY BALES are lined up in an open pasture,
     forming the outline of a football field, 1/2 the size of NFL.

     Gathered in the middle are a motley crew of PLAYERS. Has-
     beens and wannabes. There’s a hulking defensive lineman
     called TINY. An intense, jacked-up linebacker covered in
     tattoos, ALVAREZ.

     Jim Foster stands before the ragtag team, flanked by a
     muscled ex-NFL coach, RED BRUBAKER (50’s).

                         JIM FOSTER
               Fifty yards long, eight yard end
               zones. Eight men each side. But
               this is not a football field --

                         TINY
               Yeah, it’s a cow pasture.

     The guys LAUGH.

                         JIM FOSTER
               This is an arena for gladiators.
               For warriors who want a second
               chance. For true lovers of the
               game.

     He walks up to the WALL of hay bales.

                         JIM FOSTER (CONT'D)
               And this is the sideline. Yes, in
               our version of the game the
               sideline is a wall. It will pound
               and punish you, trust me. And right
               on the other side, within arm’s
               reach, there are hundreds of
               screaming fans. In time you’ll come
               to love that fact.

     Jim pauses, looks BEHIND the players. Surprised to see...

                         JIM FOSTER (CONT'D)
               Kurt... Warner.
                   (Kurt waves)
               So, has hell frozen over? Or did you
               get tired of waiting on the NFL?
                                                         61.


                       KURT
          Both, sir.

                    JIM FOSTER
              (smirks back at the players)
          Forget everything you think you
          know about football. No punts. No
          turning back. All pressure. It’s
          football at the speed of Nascar.
              (looks to Kurt)
          Think you can handle that, Warner?

ON KURT, as he takes it all in, trying not to look
intimidated. He nods.

                    KURT
          Time to find out.

Then, from behind him, we REVEAL...

                    MIKE HUDNUTT
          Well, well. Look who’s circling the
          drain.

Kurt turns to find MIKE. He smiles, gives him a BEAR HUG.

                    MIKE HUDNUTT (CONT'D)
          If we’re gonna go down, might as
          well go together!

LATER, IN THE PASTURE, Red runs the team through INTENSE
drills. They SLAM and ATTACK with a fierceness Kurt has never
seen. Alvarez SCREAMS like a crazy man, OBLITERATING anyone
in his path. And loving every second of it.

                    ALVAREZ
          That’ll wake you up in the mornin’.
          That will WAKE YOU UP!

Kurt’s eyes go wide. He steps up. Under center. HIKE. Drops
back. Gets immediately CRUSHED by Alvarez. Kurt GROANS.

                    ALVAREZ (CONT'D)
          Feels good, right?? Pain feels
          good!!

He smacks Kurt on the back, fired up. Red calls Kurt out.

                    JIM FOSTER
          Three step, drop! Get rid of the
          ball, Warner -- you look like
          you’re moving in slow motion!

Kurt struggles to orient. Looks to his three man line.
                                                               62.


                         MIKE HUDNUTT
               It’s fast. You’ll get used to it.

                         KURT
               Hey. If this is where we practice,
               where the heck do we play?

     A giant GRIN on Mike’s face.


77   INT. IOWA BARNSTORMERS’ STADIUM - OPENING GAME

     IN THE TUNNEL, Kurt gathers with his team, ready to enter.

     LOUD MUSIC and indoor FIREWORKS assault them from the arena
     inside. Fans SCREAM for their favorite players, like the WWE.
     Kurt takes a deep breath. Mike slaps his back.

                         MIKE HUDNUTT
               We call this place the House a’
               Horrors!

     Kurt leans close to hear over the ruckus.

                         KURT
               What??

                         MIKE HUDNUTT
               HOUSE OF HORRORS!

                         KURT
               Why??

                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


78   THE OPENING GAME

     It’s ABSOLUTE MADNESS:

     - Players are FLIPPED into the audience. BOUNCING off the
     foam pads, and right back into the action.

     - Fans dressed like farm animals SCREAM at the players,
     throwing beer.

     - FIST FIGHTS break out in the middle of the play. Alvarez
     RAGES on the field. CRUSHING any player he sees.

     - Footballs BOUNCE off nets and back into the hands of the
     kickoff return specialists. Kurt just stares.

                         KURT
               God help me.
                                                                 63.


     FINALLY, Kurt has possession. He lines up under center. He
     drops back, gets SACKED before he can even look downfield.

     NEXT PLAY. Kurt tries to bail from the pocket. It collapses
     before he can get away. He takes a hard HIT.

     ON JIM FOSTER, PROWLING THE SIDELINE behind Red.

                         JIM FOSTER
               Hey, Red. They got a lemon law for
               quarterbacks?

     IN THE STANDS, Brenda watches, cringing. Kurt catches her
     eye. Frustrated.


79   INT. “PERKINS” BAKERY - NIGHT

     Kurt limps to a booth with Brenda and Zack. He groans
     painfully as he sits.

                            BRENDA
               Is it bad?

                         KURT
               Pretty bad.

                            ZACK
               Can I see?

     Kurt lifts his shirt a bit,     revealing a large bruise on his
     ribs. Zack puts his hand on     it - his way of “seeing”. Kurt
     recoils from the pain. Then     Zack takes Kurt’s hand and puts
     it on a big nasty scrape on     his elbow. Sharing injuries.

                         KURT
               What happened, Z-man?

                          BRENDA
               He took a pretty nasty fall
               yesterday.

                         ZACK
                   (shrugs)
               I’m ok. You’re ok.

     It’s not lost on Kurt that the 6-year-old complains less than
     he does.

     A WAITRESS sets down a giant cinnamon roll, topped with an
     entire stick of melting butter. Zack licks his lips, so
     stoked. Kurt sighs, venting.
                                                             64.


                         KURT
               I just have to find the rhythm, you
               know? Everything moves so fast,
               it’s just... off. It doesn’t feel
               like...

                           BRENDA
               Football?

     He looks up at her.

                         KURT
               Yeah. Exactly.... You know only one
               arena player has ever made it to
               the NFL... I don’t know, Brend. I
               hope this wasn’t a mistake. I mean,
               we’ll be living in different cities
               and... I just -- I don’t feel like
               I belong here.

     Brenda stops. That didn’t sit well.

                         BRENDA
               Yeah? Where do you belong? Stocking
               shelves? You know, you might want
               to try a little gratitude. And
               maybe some humility.
                   (off his look)
               You’re not above them, Kurt.
               They’re your teammates. If you
               can’t win here with them, you’ll
               never win in the NFL.

     Tension. Finally Kurt nods, but his eyes are on the table.


80   EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - EVENING

     The sun sets. It’s ICE COLD, which doesn’t faze Kurt. He’s
     still out there, working with Red. The only other player is
     Mike, standing in for center. Jim Foster watches.

                         JIM FOSTER
               Three steps, drop and throw.

     Kurt takes a SNAP from Mike and drops back.

                         JIM FOSTER (CONT'D)
               No, you don’t have time to drop
               back and settle. It’s faster than
               that. Step and THROW.

     He drops back again. Throws again. Jim calls out.
                                                               65.


                         JIM FOSTER (CONT'D)
               You’re thinking too much, Warner.
               There’s no time to think.

     HOURS LATER. It’s dark. Kurt is still out there, alone.
     Dropping back and throwing at a painted square on a BARN.


81   INT. IOWA BARNSTORMERS’ STADIUM - NIGHT

     MID-GAME. Kurt lines up under center. Looks around. Takes a
     breath.

     DROPS BACK. THREE STEPS. THROW. Perfect strike. 20 yard gain.
     Kurt rushes up to center. Glances around. HIKE. Another
     STRIKE.

     And finally... TOUCHDOWN. The crowd CHEERS. Kurt beams.


82   INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

     Kurt packs up at his locker. Jim Foster strolls in, holding a
     wad of cash. He stops in front of Kurt, thumbs through $100
     bills.

                         JIM FOSTER
               Looks like you’re getting the hang
               of it. Here.

     He hands him a few bills.

                         KURT
               What’s this?

                         JIM FOSTER
               Touchdown bonus. Three touchdowns.
               Three hundred dollars.

                         KURT
               You pay me... per touchdown??

                         JIM FOSTER
               I also pay you to WIN. Did you even
               read your contract?


     On Kurt, and his REALIZATION. SMASH TO:


83   INT. IOWA BARNSTORMERS’ STADIUM

     - Kurt BOMBS one to the end zone.... TOUCHDOWN.
                                                               66.


     - Dances out of the pocket. Drills another one. TOUCHDOWN. A
     fan offers him a beer from the front row.

                         KURT
               Thanks! But I’m working.

     - TOUCHDOWN after TOUCHDOWN. LIGHTING.... IT.... UP. Kurt is
     a TOUCHDOWN MACHINE. From this:

                         KURT (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
               It was amazing, Babe! I threw SEVEN
               touchdowns tonight.


84   INT. RENTAL HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Brenda cradles the phone, tending to a fussing Jesse. Having
     a hard time hearing.

                         BRENDA
                   (into phone)
               How many?


85   INT. KURT’S DES MOINES APARTMENT - INTERCUT

     The players’ apartment is a DUMP. Like a HOSTEL for football
     players. There’s a party going on: players, cheerleaders,
     locals. All CELEBRATING. And Kurt in the middle, phone pressed
     to his ear. Yelling over the music.

                         KURT
               Seven. SEVEN touchdowns. It was
               epic!

                         CHEERLEADER (O.S.)
               The touchdown MACHINE!

     Kurt plugs his other ear, moves off to the side.

                         KURT
               We win next week, we’re going to
               the Semi-Finals, babe. It’s
               happening. And hey, are you getting
               my salary checks? I told them to
               send them straight.

     ON BRENDA, frustrated. As Zack tries to take the phone.

                         BRENDA
               Yeah, I got them, thanks.....
               Sounds party-ish over there.
                                                             67.


                         ZACK
                   (leaning into the phone)
               Kurt! Where are you??

                         KURT
               Z-man, hey pal!! I miss you so
               much!

                         ZACK
                   (straining to hear)
               What??

                         BRENDA
                   (frustrated)
               He can’t hear you, Kurt. Listen, I
               should get the kids down. Are you
               coming home this week? Zack’s been
               asking.

                         KURT
               Can’t, hun. We got practice. I was
               thinking, what if you come on
               Saturday. Bring the kids.

     More CHEERS behind him from a drinking game. Brenda’s heard
     enough.

                         BRENDA
               I have to study this weekend. Look,
               I’m tired. Going to bed. Love you.

                           KURT
               Wait!

     She hangs up. ON KURT, frustrated.


86   INT. IOWA BARNSTORMERS’ STADIUM - NIGHT

     “GET READY FOR THIS” blares over the loudspeaker in the PITCH
     BLACK venue. Then cheerleaders light SPARKLERS. PYROTECHNICS
     blast. Kurt is FIRST MAN, ready to lead his team out.

                         JIM FOSTER (O.S.)
               LET’S GET READY TO RUMBLE!!

     And the crowd goes WILD. Foster nods to Kurt.

                           JIM FOSTER (CONT'D)
               Told you!

                           KURT
               What?
                                                             68.


                         JIM FOSTER
               You’d love the circus!

     Kurt can’t help but SMILE. Kurt salutes, then CHARGES out
     onto the field.

                         COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
               Kurt Warner is something to behold.
               They call him Houdini - the guy
               manages to escape from any
               situation. And he just keeps
               winning. He’s breaking new records
               with every game...

     IN THE NOSEBLEEDS, Brenda pushes through the HECTIC CROWD,
     toting Jesse and Zack. She covers Jesse’s ears.

     LATER. END OF GAME, KURT BOMBS one to the end zone.
     TOUCHDOWN! He’s making it look EASY. The crowd FREAKS OUT.


87   INT. IOWA BARNSTORMERS’ STADIUM - NIGHT

     AFTER THE GAME, Kurt stands surrounded by fans, other
     players. Brenda tries to work her way to him, kids in tow.

                         BRENDA
               Excuse me. Excuse me.

     She gets bumped by people rushing ahead of her. Then STOPPED
     by a security GUARD.

                         GUARD
               You need a wristband, Ma’am. For
               the meet and greet.

                         BRENDA
               No, I’m with Kurt.

                         GUARD
               Yeah, you and everyone else. Still
               need a wristband.

                         BRENDA
               No, we’re his family...

     Then she looks down and realizes. Zack is gone. She instantly
     PANICS. Grabs Jesse’s hand and pushes backwards through
     people.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
               Zack!! ZACK!!!!
                   (to anyone)
               Have you seen my son.
                         (MORE)
                                                               69.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
               He’s six, he’s.... He’s in a green
               sweatshirt. Anyone...?!!

     She scrambles, frantic. Calling his name, pushing people out
     of the way.

     Finally she spots Zack pressed up against a trash can,
     rubbing his eyebrow and rocking back and forth, scared.

                         ZACK
               Mama??... Kurt Kurt?....

     Brenda rushes to Zack. Throws her arms around him. Thank God.
     She catches her breath, then looks through the crowd to Kurt.
     Still signing autographs. Oblivious.

                         KURT (PRE-LAP)
               I had no idea you guys were here! I
               thought you had to study.


88   EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     The kids are asleep in the car. Kurt and Brenda stand
     outside, mid-argument.

                         BRENDA
               That’s what “surprise” means, Kurt.

                         KURT
               Then why are you upset?

                         BRENDA
               I’m not. I just... I couldn’t get
               to you and then I lost Zack. And,
               it’s like... everyone else could
               and I couldn’t, and...

                         KURT
               Because I didn’t know you were
               coming. But babe... we WON. We’re
               going to the Semi-Finals.

                          BRENDA
               I know. It was supposed to be
               different....

     From across the parking lot, Alvarez calls out.

                         ALVAREZ
               Warner! Party’s at our place, man.
               Come on!

     Brenda goes cold.
                                                                70.


                         KURT
               I don’t have to go to that.

                         BRENDA
               Go ahead. We have a long drive
               back. You were great out there.

                         KURT
               Yeah?

     But it doesn’t feel that way. She gets in the car and starts
     the engine. No kiss. EMPTY. Kurt just watches her drive off.


89   INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

     Kurt grabs his stuff, SLAMS the locker, angry. Alvarez passes
     by, stops.

                         ALVAREZ
               I feel for you, man.

                         KURT
               How do you mean?

                         ALVAREZ
               Dealing with all that, while we’re
               doing all this? Must be rough with
               kids.

                         KURT
               Oh, we’re not... They aren’t my
               kids.

                         ALVAREZ
               Really?? Man, you crazy.

     He pats Kurt on the back. ON KURT, as that sinks in.


90   INT. BRENDA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Brenda plops on the couch after tucking the kids in. Lonely.
     CLICKS on the TV. Sunday Night Movie night. She looks to the
     phone.

                         JENNY JO (V.O.)
               How’s my baby girl?


91   EXT. LARRY AND JENNY JO’S HOUSE - INTERCUT

     Brenda’s parents sit out on the porch of their new home,
     listening to the sound of the nearby river.
                                                        71.


                    BRENDA
          Hey Momma. Just fine. How are you?

                     JENNY JO
          Just waitin’ on my Sunday Night
          Movie. Miss watching with you.
              (beat)
          So what does “just fine” mean?

                    BRENDA
          You know... just... fine.

                    JENNY JO
          And how’s Kurt?

A long pause.

                    BRENDA
          Far away. I don’t know.... maybe
          I’m not for him, Mom. Or maybe he’s
          not for me.

Just saying it brings tears. Brenda stifles a SOB. Mom hears.

                    JENNY JO
          Hey. Don’t give up on yourself,
          Brenda. God still has a plan for
          you, that hasn’t changed.

                    BRENDA
              (through tears)
          I don’t know, Mom. I messed it all
          up. The Marines, my marriage...
          Zack. Everything. Whatever that
          plan was, I don’t think it applies
          anymore.

                    JENNY JO
          Listen to me, young lady. You are
          strong, and beautiful, and worthy.
          And you’ll find someone who will
          love you the way you deserve to be
          loved.

Brenda wipes tears, trying to believe she deserves any of it.

                    BRENDA
          Is Daddy there?

                    JENNY JO
          Yes, and he says “Listen to your
          mother.”

Brenda laughs despite herself.
                                                             72.


                         LARRY
                   (into the phone)
               Love you, baby girl.

                         BRENDA
               Love you, too...


92   INT. KURT’S DES MOINES APARTMENT - DAY

     Kurt lies on his bed, alone. Tosses the football in the air,
     lost in thought. There’s a KNOCK at the door. Kurt opens it
     to find Brenda. He’s surprised.

                         KURT
               Hey. No kids?

                          BRENDA
               No kids.

                         KURT
               Oh. Want to grab some lunch?

                         BRENDA
               Actually. Can you sit for a few
               minutes?

     Kurt hesitates. Okay...

     IN THE LIVING ROOM. Brenda eyes the couches, tries to find
     one to sit on. They’re all GROSS.

                         KURT
               Sorry. Jim got us this furniture.
               They pulled it from some flooded
               hotel downtown.

     Kurt lays a jacket down. But Brenda pulls up a chair across
     from him and sits. Takes a breath, gets right to it.

                         BRENDA
               Listen, I just want to say this,
               and get it out. And I want you to
               know, I’m not angry.

     Kurt tightens, already defensive.

                         KURT
               Angry about what?...

                         BRENDA
               I’m not. I’m not angry. I’m...
               happy for you. For everything. For
               what’s happening in your life.
                         (MORE)
                                                           73.

                     BRENDA (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          But it isn’t working for my life.

Kurt is trying to catch up.

                    KURT
          Wait, hold up, Brend.

                    BRENDA
          Let me just finish. I’ve been
          through this before, you know that.
          And I can’t do it again. I know
          where it ends. So let’s just...
          skip to that part. Save ourselves a
          lot of time and tears.

Kurt stares at her, can’t believe what he’s hearing.

                    KURT
          I’m not your ex husband, Brenda,
          give me a little credit.

                    BRENDA
          I do. But Kurt.... you have a dream
          to chase. And you deserve to chase
          it without any baggage.

                    KURT
          Oh, so this is you looking out for
          me? Give me a break, Brenda, just
          be honest. You’re afraid, that I’m
          gonna bail on you, that I’ll hurt
          you...

                    BRENDA
          I’m afraid we’re going to hurt each
          other! I’m just trying to be
          responsible.

That word triggers something in Kurt.

                    KURT
          “Responsible?” Right. You need
          someone who can provide.

                    BRENDA
          No, that’s not...

He gets up and walks from the room. When he returns he’s
holding a jar stuffed with $100 bills. Hands it to her.

                    BRENDA (CONT'D)
          What is this?
                                                             74.


                         KURT
               My touchdown money.

     She looks at him, confused. Hurt. This has gone all wrong.

                          KURT (CONT'D)
               I get it. You’re right.
                   (bitter)
               So let’s just do this now, get it
               over with.

                         BRENDA
               Are you paying me... to break up?

                         KURT
               You broke up with me.

                         BRENDA
               It was a discussion--

                         KURT
               I gotta get to practice.

     And he leaves, SLAMMING the door behind him. OFF her look--

                         COMMENTATOR (O.S.)
               What a performance from Kurt Warner
               tonight. Five touchdowns. 432 yards
               in the air.


93   INT. BARNSTORMERS STADIUM - SEMI-FINALS - NIGHT

     THE CROWD RUSHES THE FIELD as the clock RUNS OUT.

                         COMMENTATOR (O.S.)
               And with that the newest team in
               the league, the Barnstormers, are
               going to the Arena Bowl for a
               chance to win it all!

     Amidst the celebration and chaos, Kurt is pulled in every
     direction. Reporters, fans, surrounding him. Begging for
     autographs. But Kurt is utterly lost. Then his gaze settles
     on a woman in the stands. It’s HIS MOM.


94   EXT. IOWA BARNSTORMERS’ STADIUM - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     It’s late. They sit on the back of Sue’s flatbed truck. Kurt
     drinks a beer, spins a football in his hand.

                         SUE
               Shouldn’t you be celebrating?
                                                           75.


                    KURT
              (raises his beer)
          What do you think this is?

Sue chuckles. They sit for a beat. Kurt feels her watching
him.

                      KURT (CONT'D)
          What?

                     SUE
          That’s not the face of someone who
          just made the Finals.
              (then)
          Where’s Brenda?

Kurt shrugs.

                      KURT
          Broke up.

She nods, already figured that out. But she doesn’t look
happy about it.

                    SUE
          Winning doesn’t always feel like
          winning, huh?

                    KURT
          Never has. No matter what I do, no
          matter how hard I try, no matter
          what I accomplish. Why is that?

                    SUE
          Cause it doesn’t mean anything if
          you don’t have someone to share it
          with. I hope you don’t think you
          failed somehow, not playing for the
          NFL.

Kurt scoffs, a little bitter.

                    KURT
          This is my purpose. That’s what you
          always told me, right? This ball
          “defines” me.

Sue looks at him, surprised. Realizing...

                    SUE
          Kurt. That’s not what I meant. You
          were always good at it, sure. You
          enjoyed it.
                    (MORE)

                          SUE (CONT'D)
               But there’s not a ball or a game or
               a stadium in this world big enough
               to define you.
                    (turns to him)
               You’ve grown up to be a good man.
               Those are not easy to find, I would
               know. But I’m glad Brenda found
               one.

                         KURT
               Thought you didn’t like her.

                         SUE
               I just... didn’t want you to
               struggle the way I struggled.
                   (with difficulty)
               But MY story doesn’t have to be HER
               story. You love her, you’ve stuck
               with her, with those kids -- and I
               am so proud of you for that. She
               makes you happy son, I’ve seen it.
               She makes you better.

     Kurt takes a breath, fighting emotion.

                         KURT
               So what do I do?

                         SUE
               Go get the girl, dummy.


95   EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     Kurt speeds along a dark interstate.


96   INT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT

     Brenda washes dishes. Hears a KNOCK. She peeks through the
     window, sees Kurt. Surprised. He speaks through the door.

                         KURT
               Can we talk?

                         BRENDA
               We already talked.

                         KURT
               Come on, Brenda. Please.

                         BRENDA
               I don’t think it’s a good idea.
                                                             77.


                         KURT
               You’re really not gonna let me in?
                   (no answer)
               Hello?

     AN HOUR LATER, Kurt sits leaning against the door.

                         KURT (CONT'D)
               Would you please just let me in?

                         BRENDA
               We made a decision. I’m sticking to
               it.

                         KURT
               But what if it was a bad decision?

                         BRENDA
               Is that how you feel?

                         KURT
               I don’t know, I just...

                         BRENDA
               Go home, Kurt.

                         KURT
               I’m not leaving.

                         BRENDA
               Suit yourself.

     ANOTHER HOUR LATER, Kurt still leans against the door.
     Suddenly he hears COUNTRY MUSIC playing softly from inside.

     He peers through the glass and sees Zack, RADIO IN HAND. He
     sets the radio on the floor for Kurt. Then taps on the glass.

                         ZACH
                   (whispers)
               I have to go to bed.

     And he scurries off. Kurt smiles bittersweetly.


97   INT. RENTAL HOUSE - DAWN

     Brenda is up early. She peeks out the window to see:

     Kurt, asleep on the porch in an old lawn chair. She SIGHS,
     quietly opens the front door. Kurt springs awake.

                         BRENDA
               I don’t want to wake anybody.
                                                                78.


     Brenda’s voice isn’t angry. It’s compassionate.

                          KURT
               Brenda.

                         BRENDA
               You’ll be fine without me.

                         KURT
               But I’m better with you.

                         BRENDA
               It’s okay. Just go.

     She closes the door. He sighs.


98   INT. KURT’S DES MOINES APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Kurt watches TV. Sunday Night Movie. The PHONE RINGS. He
     checks Caller ID. Smiles.

                         KURT
               Hey, there.

                          BRENDA (V.O.)
               Kurt...?

     Kurt’s smile drops. He can tell immediately something is off.

                         KURT
               Brenda, what’s wrong?

     She talks through HEAVING SOBS, barely comprehensible.

                         BRENDA
               Kurt... oh my God...! My
               parents....KURT!!!

     She’s WAILING now, unable to speak. Kurt leaps up.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
               Just get here. PLEASE get here.


99   INT. ARKANSAS HORIZON - MORNING

     Kurt drives as fast as he can. Worried. ON THE RADIO:
                                                               79.


                          RADIO NEWS (V.O.)
                A F5 tornado has swept through
                northwest Arkansas, leaving at
                least nine dead and dozens missing
                and injured... Thousands are still
                without power...


100   EXT. LARRY AND JENNY JO’S HOUSE - MORNING

      Kurt pulls up to what was once Brenda’s parents home. It’s
      now just a concrete SLAB, surrounded by debris.

      Brenda stands in the rubble, looking lost. Kim and her
      husband JOHN stand nearby. All of them in shock.

                             KURT
                Brenda!

      Kurt jumps from the car and rushes to her. She COLLAPSES into
      his arms.

                          BRENDA
                This was their house! This was
                their house!

      Brenda drops to her knees on the concrete.

                          BRENDA (CONT'D)
                I was just here, Kurt. Two months
                ago. This can’t be real...

      There’s a step in front of them that once led to the front
      door. Kurt pushes away the debris. Inscribed in the concrete:
      “L+J Carney”, then a heart.

                          BRENDA (CONT'D)
                That’s my dad’s writing.

      Brenda bursts into SOBS. Kurt sits beside her.

                          BRENDA (CONT'D)
                WHY?? Why would He take them from
                me?? I’m sick of losing people!
                Sick of being let down!! I can’t do
                it anymore....

      Kurt tries calming her, but she HITS him, letting out her
      anger. He swallows her into his arms. Just holds her.

                             KURT
                I got you.
                                                              80.


101   EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

      Brenda, Kurt, Kim and John sit in a small circle of lawn
      chairs in a motel parking lot, drinking beers in silence.

      Brenda holds a cracked photo of the family. The only one they
      found. She speaks softly, mostly to herself.

                          BRENDA
                They’re gone. Really gone....

      A long pause, as she tries to make sense of her own words.
      Then --

                          BRENDA (CONT'D)
                At least we know where they went.
                I’m trying to picture them up there
                now. Together. No pain. No tears...
                I’ll bet they’re dancing.

      Kim nods. Brenda’s eye fill with fresh tears. But they’re
      different tears. She smiles, bittersweet. Then closes her
      eyes.

                          BRENDA (CONT'D)
                    (a whisper)
                Thank you, God...

      CLOSE ON KURT, amazed by this. That she can find a way to be
      grateful, even in this moment. Finally Kurt raises his beer.

                          KURT
                To Larry and Jenny Jo.

      They all raise a bottle. Brenda’s gaze lingers on Kurt for a
      moment. Then she stands.

                          BRENDA
                I need to check on the kids.

                          KURT
                No, I got it. Stay.


102   INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

      Kurt looks in on Zack and Jesse. Watches them sleep. He pulls
      the blanket up further over Zack. Softly:

                          KURT
                I’ve missed you, buddy.

      Kurt sits on the edge of the bed and lets out a breath. His
      first moment alone. He rubs his temples. Then his eyes....
                                                              81.


      And suddenly TEARS. Kurt sobs as quietly as he can.

      Then, from behind him, small arms wrap around his neck. It’s
      Zack.

                          KURT (CONT'D)
                Sorry, Z-man. Didn’t mean to wake
                you, I just...

      Zack doesn’t say a word. Just wipes away Kurt’s tears. And
      hugs him. Kurt clutches him tight and just BREAKS.

      FROM THE DOORWAY, Brenda watches them hold onto each other.
      And somehow her shattered heart is mended just a bit.


103   EXT. THE WHITE RIVER - DAY

      Brenda and Kim each carry an urn. They walk with Kurt and
      John on a path toward the river. Suddenly, Brenda stops and
      pulls Kurt aside.

                          BRENDA
                Ok, here’s the thing.
                    (he nods)
                I’m gonna remember this moment for
                the rest of my life. So the way I see
                it, if you’re not gonna be with me...
                I don’t want you in this memory.

      Kurt nods again. Okay.

                          BRENDA (CONT'D)
                I mean it. It would be stupid that
                you were here. Right?

      Kurt takes her hand. Looks her right in the eye.

                          KURT
                It’s ok, Brenda. I’m gonna be here.

      AT THE RIVER BANK, Brenda and Kim stand by the water’s edge.
      Kurt and John beside them. Brenda’s urn is open.

                          KIM
                Um... I don’t know which one is Mom
                and which one is Dad.

                          BRENDA
                Well, this one’s heavier, it’s
                probably Dad.

      They both SNICKER.
                                                                82.


                             KURT
                Ladies.

                          KIM
                Maybe we just... mix them together?

      The boys shake there heads. Brenda addresses her urn.

                          BRENDA
                Mom... or Dad...

      Kim SNICKERS again, so does Brenda. Then the tears start.

                          BRENDA (CONT'D)
                I miss you. And I love you. And
                sometimes... there are no other
                words to say.

      She kneels down and spreads the ashes. They float, then
      dissolve into the water. Then Kim steps forward and opens her
      urn. She pours the urn, but UP and OUT instead of down.

      The WIND kicks it back in her face.

                          KIM
                Oh no!! UGHK, it’s in my nose! My
                nose!

      Brenda busts out LAUGHING, tears still in her eyes. Kim
      sneezes.

                          BRENDA
                God bless you, Mom!

                             KIM
                It’s Dad!

      The girls cannot stop LAUGHING. Kurt tries to hold out, but
      fails. Brenda looks back at him, and her smile says it all.
      I’m glad you’re here.


104   EXT. MOTEL - MORNING

      Kurt loads the kids into a cab, then turns to face Brenda. He
      wraps her in his arms. One of those long, warm moments.

                          BRENDA
                Thanks for taking them. I’ll be
                back in a few days.

                          KURT
                Least I can do. Whenever you’re
                ready.... See you at home.
                                                                 83.


      Kurt waves goodbye to Kim and John, then ducks into the cab.


105   EXT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT

      John and Kim pull into the driveway. Brenda climbs from the
      back seat, bag in hand. She looks up to see:

      Kurt standing outside the house, kids beside him. Brenda
      smiles. Confused. What’s up?


106   INT. RENTAL HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Kurt opens the door. The kids lead Brenda inside, excited.

      BRENDA’S POV: The ratty old house has been transformed. Rose
      petals line the hall. Flickering candles lead to the backyard.

      Brenda looks to Kurt. The kids GIGGLE. Zack leads his Mom
      slowly forward. Jesse follows behind, picking up the flowers.


      OUTSIDE ON THE PATIO

      A vase of roses on the table. And a boom box. Kurt whispers
      something to Zack, who grins and presses PLAY. Immediately:
      ‘Fishin’ in the Dark’ plays.

      Kurt takes Brenda’s hand and they start dancing. She buries
      her head in his shoulder.

                          KURT
                Babe. All my life I defined myself
                by what I could do on that field.
                What I could accomplish, how many
                games I could win. But... I always
                came up empty. It was never enough.
                Like I was meant for something
                else. Something more. And you,
                you’ve been waiting all these
                years, for that promise. God’s big
                plans for you.
                    (looks into her eyes)
                What if it’s this? Us. Together?

      Kurt hits a switch that LIGHTS UP the backyard fence with
      Christmas lights that spell out: “WILL YOU MARRY ME?”

      Brenda GASPS. Kurt gets on one knee. Holds up a little box.

                          KURT (CONT'D)
                Everything I want in the world is
                right here.
                          (MORE)
                                                                 84.

                           KURT (CONT'D)
                It doesn’t matter if I play
                football, or if I don’t, or what I
                play or where. Because.... Winning
                isn’t winning without you.
                    (beat)
                I love you. And I want what you
                have, babe. Your faith, your
                strength. You make me--

                            BRENDA
                Yes. Yes.

                          KURT
                Wait. Let me ask the question. I
                haven’t asked --

                          BRENDA
                Then get on with it. God!

      Now Kurt stalls. Turns to the kids.

                          KURT
                How about you guys? Will you be my
                family? For real? Forever.

      They both NOD. Giggling. He turns back to Brenda.

                          KURT (CONT'D)
                Brenda Carney Meoni, will you--

                            BRENDA
                YES!

                          KURT
                Will you please let me finish?

                            BRENDA
                NO!

      And she KISSES him.


107   INT. BARNSTORMERS STADIUM - NIGHT

      Super: ARENA BOWL.

      Kurt, mid-game. Playing hard. Having a blast. The crowd is
      LOVING HIM. Chanting his name. Brenda SCREAMS for him in the
      front row, kids by her side.

      Kurt throws a scoring pass. As he runs back mid-field, a
      BUSINESSMAN calls to him from behind the wall.
                                                              85.


                          BUSINESSMAN
                Hey, Kurt Warner! I want to talk to
                you after the game!

      Kurt nods at the guy. Sure, pal. No idea who he is. But JIM
      FOSTER sees him and cringes. He knows EXACTLY who the guy is.

      LAST DRIVE. Kurt has a heck of a game, but they miss the win
      by ONE FOOT. In Kurt’s disappointment...

      POST GAME, Kurt greets fans, Brenda by his side. The
      Businessman approaches.

                          DAVID GILLIS
                Heck of a game for you, Kurt.

                          KURT
                Well, it didn’t help us win. I hate
                to lose, sir. Hate it for the team.

                          DAVID GILLIS
                I’m David Gillis. We’ve been trying
                to reach you. We want you to come
                try out for us.

                           KURT
                Try out?

      Gillis waits for it to register. Kurt looks to Jim Foster,
      confused. Jim just shrugs.

                          JIM FOSTER
                I’ve been... putting off his calls
                for a while. Can you blame me?

                          KURT
                    (back to Gillis)
                I’m sorry, WHO are you?

                          DAVID GILLIS
                I’m with THE RAMS.

      On Kurt and his SHOCK.


108   INT. ST. LOUIS RAMS WAR ROOM - DAY

      MIKE MARTZ, the Rams’ offensive coordinator, sits with DICK
      VERMEIL, the head coach, and JOHN RAMSDELL, the quarterbacks
      coach. Vermeil studies the depth chart.

                          MIKE MARTZ
                I don’t get it, Dick.
                                                              86.


                          DICK VERMEIL
                I like him. It’s a hunch.

                          MIKE MARTZ
                Arena Football? You really think
                that’ll translate.

                          DICK VERMEIL
                Character translates anywhere.

                          COACH RAMSDELL
                GM likes his price. I think our
                groundskeeper will make more this
                season.

                          MIKE MARTZ
                He’s old, he’s slow as molasses.
                Frankly, he’s below the standards
                of this franchise.

                          COACH RAMSDELL
                Got a howitzer for a right arm,
                though.

                          MIKE MARTZ
                Why are we even talking about this?
                There is no way this guy makes the
                team.


109   EXT. CEDAR FALLS CHURCH - DAY

      KURT AND BRENDA’S WEDDING RECEPTION - A humble, old fashioned
      potluck. Filled with family and friends. Including KURT’S
      DAD. Kurt and Brenda dance. He’s in a tux and she looks
      STUNNING in her wedding dress.

      LATER, Brenda leads Jesse (now 4) to the middle of the dance
      floor. Hands her the mic. She turns to Kurt.

                          JESSE
                Daddy, may I have this dance?

      The crowd responds with a collective “AWWWWW” as the band
      plays “Butterfly Kisses”. Kurt LIFTS Jesse up and floats with
      her across the floor, eyes filled with tears.

      LATER, The DJ plays the song: “Thanks to the Keeper of the
      Stars.” Zack holds the mic and BELTS OUT every word. Kurt
      stands next to his dad, listening. Both share a beer.

                          DAD
                You make a great family. I’m happy
                you found each other.
                                                              87.


                          KURT
                Thanks, Dad.

                          DADAT
                    (after a be)
                I’m sorry I missed out on so much.
                Especially when you were younger.

                          KURT
                Dad. It’s ok. You taught me what I
                needed when you were there...
                and when you weren’t, actually.
                    (hugs him)
                You’re here now. That’s what
                matters.

      END OF THE NIGHT. Kurt and Brenda dance, surrounded by their
      friends. Admiring each other and the kids.

                          BRENDA
                When do you go?

                          KURT
                First light. Camp starts Tuesday.
                    (holds her close)
                Look, I know it’s a long shot...
                and I know it’s my last shot. So I
                just wanna say, if this doesn’t
                work out. That’s it. I’ll put it
                down. And I’ll be okay with it.

                          BRENDA
                So this is your “all in”?

                          KURT
                    (tucks her hair)
                Well, this is my all in. But yeah,
                something like that.

                          BRENDA
                Then, Kurt. Do me one favor...
                    (leans close and whispers)
                WIN THE DAMN THING.

      His eyes light up. Hell yeah!


110   EXT. MACOMB, ILLINOIS - RAMS TRAINING CAMP - DAY

      NFL Training Camp - the sequel. Kurt drives up and jumps from
      his truck. Like a racehorse breaking from the gate.

      ON THE PRACTICE FIELD
                                                              88.


      Quarterback TRENT GREEN is the clear number one. Kurt watches
      from the sideline as Trent takes all the reps. And makes the
      HARDEST THROWS. Kurt’s not the only one with a strong arm.

      Mike Martz claps from the sideline.

                          MARTZ
                Way to sling it, Trent!

      Martz steps close to Kurt. Doesn’t make eye contact, just
      starts talking.

                          MARTZ (CONT'D)
                Packers called you up once.

                          KURT
                Yes sir. Long time ago.

                          MARTZ
                How long did you last?

                          KURT
                Not long enough.

      Martz nods. Exactly. He steps close. Looks to Kurt’s
      playbook.

                          MARTZ
                Don’t get too comfortable, Arena
                boy.

      With that, he walks away. Another player, ISSAC BRUCE, steps
      up.

                          ISAAC
                Don’t mind Coach Martz. His bite is
                worse than his bark.

      Kurt LAUGHS, grateful.

                           ISAAC (CONT'D)
                Let me know if you need anything.
                I’m Isaac.

                          KURT
                Man, I know who you are.

      Isaac smiles and trots off.


111   EXT. TRAINING CAMP FIELD - DAY

      Mike Martz has turned Kurt into his personal whipping boy.
      Berating him at every turn.
                                                                 89.


      ON THE FIELD - INTERCUTTING

      Trent makes a throw.

                          MARTZ
                Good read, Trent. Good read.

      Kurt makes the exact same throw.

                          MARTZ (CONT'D)
                The hell you doing, boy?! Wrong
                read. WRONG DAMN READ!

      Kurt shakes his head. Isaac steps close.

                          ISAAC
                Ride it out, rook. All in the plan.

      Isaac points up, then pumps his fist over his heart. A symbol
      of faith. Kurt registers.


112   INT. THE FILM ROOM - DAY

      The quarterbacks and receivers watch film. IN THE FOOTAGE,
      Trent throws a pass slightly BEHIND Isaac, the receiver.
      Martz freezes the frame.

                          MARTZ
                Now let me tell you why Trent put
                that ball there. He was trying to
                protect you from getting hit.

      MORE VIDEO. This time Kurt makes a near identical throw,
      slightly behind his receiver. Martz explodes.

                          MARTZ (CONT'D)
                Kurt! You gotta hit him in stride.

                             KURT
                Yessir.

                          MARTZ
                What are you grinnin’ about, Arena
                Boy?

                          KURT
                I don’t know sir... Just wondering
                why everyone moves so slow here in
                the NFL.

      A couple guys CHUCKLE at this. Damn.
                                                              90.


      Martz takes out a $50 bill and sticks it to a chair with a
      piece of chewed gum. As he walks out --

                          MARTZ
                This is for Warner when he learns
                to throw a spiral!

      ON THE FIELD. Kurt lines up behind JONES, his center. Jones
      flubs the snap. The ball SQUIBS away. Martz blows his
      WHISTLE, storms onto the field. Gets inches from Kurt’s face.

                          MARTZ (CONT'D)
                What the damn hell are you
                thinking?! HOW CAN YOU DROP THAT?!

      The other players look around. WTF? They know Kurt never even
      touched the ball. Not his fault. Martz points over at Jones.

                          MARTZ (CONT'D)
                That man’s risking his life for
                you, EVERY SNAP!

      More looks. Is Kurt just going to take it?

                          MARTZ (CONT'D)
                And you don’t have the dignity to
                HOLD ONTO THE DAMN BALL!?
                    (Throws the ball at Kurt)
                HOLD ONTO THE BALL.

      Kurt takes a breath, but keeps his mouth shut.

                          KURT
                My mistake. Won’t happen again.

      FROM A DISTANCE, Coach Vermeil watches. Isaac trots up beside
      him.

                          ISAAC
                Just took a bullet for his team.
                    (raises an eyebrow)
                You know what that is, Coach?
                Leadership.

      Vermeil nods. Taking it all in from a distance.


113   EXT/INT. THE TRANS WORLD DOME (RAMS STADIUM) - DAY

      Kurt, in civilian clothes, walks out onto the turf of the
      gleaming new stadium. Looks up and around.

                          VOICE (O.C.)
                Beautiful, isn’t it?
                                                              91.


      Kurt turns to face Coach Dick Vermeil.

                            KURT
                Yes, sir.

                          DICK VERMEIL
                Kurt. From the first time I saw you
                I thought there’s something special
                about that kid. Looks like I’m
                gonna get the chance to find out.

      He holds out his hand. Smiles.

                          VERMEIL
                Welcome to the Rams, son.

      Kurt shakes his hand, ecstatic. Then gives him a HUGE HUG.


114   EXT. ST. LOUIS - NEW HOME - DAY

      Kurt walks Brenda through a spacious, brand new house. It’s
      beautiful. She can’t believe it.

                          KURT
                Nice, right? Sits on four acres.

                          BRENDA
                Kurt. We can’t afford this. I mean
                what if you get traded. Or
                something worse...

                          KURT
                Don’t worry, it’s not gonna happen.

                          BRENDA
                How do you know that?

                          KURT
                I’m trusting.
                    (with a grin)
                Staying in the pocket. Isn’t that
                what you’ve been trying to teach
                me?

                          BRENDA
                Don’t even.

      He hugs her. She takes in the huge empty foyer.

                          BRENDA (CONT'D)
                Seriously, though. Can we even
                afford this?
                                                              92.


                          KURT
                Hmmm, good question. Since I’m only
                making league minimum... $250,000.

      Her eyes go WIDE.

                           BRENDA
                DOLLARS?

      And she practically tackles him.


115   INT. TRANS WORLD DOME - NIGHT

      Game on. The Rams have the ball. TITLE:

           ST. LOUIS RAMS EXHIBITION SEASON - AUGUST 1999

                           RAMS VS. CHARGERS

      Trent Green drops back to pass, delivers STRIKE AFTER STRIKE
      to the Rams’ fleet of talented receivers.

      Kurt, #13 in his Rams uniform and wearing a headset, CHEERS
      from the sidelines next to Coach Ramsdell, watches Trent
      complete yet another perfectly threaded pass.

                          KURT
                Way to throw, Trent! Way to throw!
                What is that? Eleven in a row?

                          COACH RAMSDELL
                    (smiles)
                QB on fire.

      UP IN THE STANDS, Brenda sits with three other Rams WIVES,
      all clearly younger and better dressed. They wear gobs of
      jewelry, full makeup and tailored jerseys with their
      husbands’ names on the back. Brenda is a fish out of water.

      OUT ON THE FIELD, Trent stands in the pocket, releases the
      ball just as the Chargers’ safety CRASHES INTO HIM.

      Trent falls to the turf, clutching his knee. All the players
      react. Issac throws his fist into the turf.

      ON THE COACHES. Dick Vermeil blinks. Martz’s face goes white.
      The TRAINERS rush out. Trent is writhing in pain.

      Kurt steps forward. Looking at the situation... then he
      glances up to the Jumbotron and realizes how bad this is. THE
      CAMERAS ARE ALL ON HIM. From this:

      MONTAGE OF NEWS FOOTAGE. THE KURT WARNER DEBATE HAS BEGUN:
                                                               93.


      - Sportscenter. Every network and halftime report. Sports
      radio. The entire SPORTS NATION is talking about Kurt Warner.

                          SPORTSCASTER
                The Rams hopes for a comeback
                seasons just went down with Trent
                Green.

                          SPORTSCASTER 2
                There is NO WAY they trust their
                franchise to a rookie from the
                Arena Football league. They’re
                gonna have to recruit someone new,
                and fast.

      And ON and ON....


118   INT. KURT’S NEW HOUSE - THE LIVING ROOM - DAY

      Not much furniture yet. The TV blares SPORTSCENTER. Knees
      bouncing, Kurt watches intently, just like the draft years
      earlier. But this time the TV has his picture on it.

      Kurt watches and listens, taking it all in.

                          ESPN TALKING HEAD (ON SCREEN)
                If you’d asked me a week ago with a
                healthy Trent Green, I’ve got the
                Rams going 8 and 8, but... Kurt
                Warner behind center - they’ll be
                playing for the number one pick.

                          OTHER SPORTSCENTER GUY
                Agreed. The stock boy is never gonna
                cut it. But hey, maybe he can help
                them shop for a new quarterback!

      They LAUGH. Kurt’s jaw tightens, then his gaze shifts out the
      window, to a new JOHN DEERE MOWER in the yard. He looks to
      Zack, playing with a BLACK TRUCK.

      Then he looks back to the TV and... it takes everything in
      him... Turns it OFF. Takes in the silence.

                          KURT
                Hey buddy. Want to do something
                fun?

      Zack nods. Kurt takes one last look at the TV, then...
                                                               94.


119   EXT. KURT’S NEW HOUSE - DAY

      The mower travels in a big circle in the yard. Zack WHOOPS
      and YELLS, sitting on Kurt’s lap... DRIVING!

                          ZACK
                I... AM... DRIVING!!!

                          KURT
                Yes, you are.

                          ZACK
                I wanna do it myself...

                          KURT
                No buddy, you can’t.

                          ZACK
                I’M READY! I CAN DO IT!

                          KURT
                I don’t know if that’s a good idea.

                          ZACK
                BELIEVE ME!

                          KURT
                Momma wouldn’t like that.

                          ZACK
                She’s not here!

      Kurt LAUGHS. Good point. He sees the excitement and sheer
      confidence on Zack’s face.


120   INT. CAR - LATER

      Brenda drives up to the house. Listening to the RADIO.
      HUFFING. Getting more angry with EVERY SENTENCE.

                          RADIO (O.S.)
                Warner is a joke, there’s no way...
                No WAY Vermeil is gonna bet on him.

                          BRENDA
                    (yells to the radio)
                Shut up, Jackass! You don’t know my
                husband!

      Then she looks up and double takes. She sees -- ZACK DRIVING
      THE RIDER MOWER BY HIMSELF! She jumps from the car...
                                                              95.


121   EXT. YARD - CONTINUOUS

                          BRENDA
                Zack!! Honey, no!

                          KURT (O.S.)
                He’s good! He’s good!

      Brenda spins to find Kurt on a lounge chair, drink in hand.

                          KURT (CONT'D)
                Sit with me.

                          BRENDA
                Kurt! Why would you let him do
                that?

                          KURT
                He said he was ready... and I
                believed him.

      Reluctant, she sits next to Kurt. Then watches for a minute
      as Zack drives in circles. She smiles.

                           KURT (CONT'D)
                Take it in, Brenda.
                    (beat)
                That’s a blind boy driving a truck.

                          BRENDA
                Tractor. And it’s not black.

                          KURT
                Close enough.


122   INT. MIKE MARTZ’S OFFICE - DAY

      Kurt stands in Martz’s office. Waiting. He glances at all the
      pictures, memorabilia and swag on the walls.

      Finally Martz storms in. Looks Warner up and down.

                          MARTZ
                Sit down, Kurt.

                          KURT
                Thank you, sir. I’d prefer to
                stand.

      Martz checks him. Interesting.

                          MARTZ
                Go ahead, then. Tell me.
                                                        96.


                    KURT
          Tell you what?

                    MARTZ
          Why a team worth eight hundred
          million dollars should put a stock
          boy in the driver’s seat. Because
          you threw some touchdowns in a
          little football arena?
              (Doesn’t faze Kurt)
          Sorry to burst your bubble, Warner,
          but you passed your expiration
          date. You’re too old to be a
          rookie, too green to be a pro. You
          don’t belong here.

                    KURT
          You’re wrong, sir. Just give me a
          chance and I’ll prove it to you.

                    MARTZ
          You’re gonna make us the laughing
          stock of this league. You’re gonna
          embarrass yourself, every member of
          this team and every fan in this
          city.

                    KURT
          That’s not true.

                    MARTZ
          You do not have what it takes.
          That’s what I believe. So why in
          the world should I give you this
          shot?

Kurt meets his gaze. Doesn’t blink.

                    KURT
          Because this is my time, sir. I
          know who I am and I know why I’m
          here. I’ve earned this. I’ve waited
          for it, I have bled for it, and I
          am ready for it. And I will not let
          you down. You give me the ball and
          I will win for you.

With that, he walks right out the door. Martz sits for a long
beat. Then he nods. Smirks. Picks up the PHONE. And dials.

                    MARTZ
          Hey coach... He’s ready.
                                                               97.


      IN HIS OFFICE, on the other end, Vermeil lowers the phone...
      a SMILE crosses his face.


123   INT. RAMS PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY

      Dick Vermeil faces a room full of reporters. There’s a BUZZ
      in the space. Questions flying at him. “What’s the next
      move?” “Can you tell us your plan?”.....

      Vermeil waits for it to quiet down. He leans into the mic.

                            VERMEIL
                 As a team, as a franchise, we have
                 made a decision. And we stand by
                 our decision.
                     (firm)
                 We will rally behind Kurt Warner...
                 And we will play good football!

      FLASHBULBS POP. The place ERUPTS with questions.


124   EXT. TRANS WORLD ARENA - NIGHT

      The parking lot is filled with Rams fans pre-gaming.

      Super:   Season Opener. Rams Vs. Ravens. September 12, 1999

      AN ARIAL SHOT OF THE PACKED STADIUM. It plays on a TV SCREEN
      in:


125   INT. WILD E. COYOTE BAR - SAME

      Where Hudnutt and the other arena players watch at the bar.
      Warner’s picture flashes on screen and they all YELL.


126   INT. STADIUM - NIGHT

      Brenda rushes in high heels down the cavernous halls to the
      restricted area. Flashes her pass to a guard.


127   INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      The Rams players file out. Kurt hangs back. He lays out his
      jersey, with the name WARNER on the back. #13. Smooths his
      hand over it, just like when he was a kid.

                           BRENDA’S VOICE (O.C.)
                 I do love a man in a uniform.
                                                                98.


      Kurt turns back. His face lights up.

                          KURT
                What are you doing -- how’d you get
                in here?!

                          BRENDA
                I needed you to hear this before
                you went out on that field.
                It’s from our son.

      She pulls a piece of paper from her purse. Flattens it.

                          BRENDA (CONT'D)
                “To my daddy Kurt Kurt. You fix all
                my radios. You walk to the gas
                station in the snow. You never give
                up on me. You never give up. You
                play your football game. I drive my
                truck. Love, Zack.”

      Kurt wipes his eyes, overwhelmed.

                          BRENDA (CONT'D)
                That little boy has defied all
                odds, every time. Proved everyone
                wrong. And so can you.
                    (proud)
                You helped me believe again. That
                all things are possible. Now it’s
                time to prove it to yourself.

      Kurt beams. He carefully takes the paper and tucks it inside
      his pocket.

                          BRENDA (CONT'D)
                You nervous?

                             KURT
                Terrified.

      She takes his face in her hands.

                           BRENDA
                Go show the world what I’ve known
                all along.

      A long and beautiful kiss.


128   INT. INSIDE THE TUNNEL - NIGHT

      Kurt stands tall amidst his band of brothers. They run out
      one-by-one as the ANNOUNCER calls their name.
                                                           99.


Kurt takes a deep breath. He catches Isaac Bruce’s eye. Who
pumps his chest and points at Kurt. Finally:

                    PA ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
          Number 13 -- KUUURT WARNER!!

As Kurt runs out onto the turf, he points two fingers to the
sky. Takes in the CHEERS, the spectacle, the sold out crowd.
This is it. He made it.

IN THE STANDS, Brenda joins Kurt’s Mom and Matt. And on
Matt’s other side - Kurt’s father. They’re on their feet,
SCREAMING and CHEERING. Sue gives Brenda a hug and Brenda
points down at Kurt:

ON THE FIELD, Kurt runs to the Rams sideline, helmet in hand.

MOMENTS LATER, the National Anthem is sung. Kurt stands. Hand
over his heart. And everyone CHEERS. Kurt finds BRENDA in the
stands. Blows her a kiss. Vermeil walks right up to Kurt.

                    VERMEIL
          You ready for this, son?

Kurt nods. Pumped. Then he looks across the field to the
Raven’s linebacker. RAY LEWIS, #52. He’s an absolute BEAST.
Staring daggers at Kurt.

                    RAY LEWIS
          You’re all mine now, rook. ALL
          MINE!

Kurt swallows. OFF THIS:

THE RAVENS KICK OFF. The football spins end over end as:

                    TV ANNOUNCER (O.C.)
          Here we go! Rams versus Ravens.
          Brand new season! And you know
          Vermeil is taking a ton of heat for
          betting the farm on a kid whose
          resume is, well...

                    COLOR MAN (O.C.)
          ...non-existent?

A SERIES OF PLAYS

Kurt lines up behind center, barks out the count, then hands
off to Marshall Faulk, who gains two yards off the tackle.

ON THE RAVENS DEFENSE, RAY LEWIS shouts out instructions to
his teammates.
                                                       100.


Kurt drops back for his first pass. Lewis blitzes from the
left side, around a lineman and SLAMS KURT TO THE GROUND.

                    TV ANNOUNCER (O.C.)
          Ray Lewis with the sack.

As Lewis climbs off Kurt:

                    RAY LEWIS
          You don’t belong here, Arena Boy!

Kurt pops up, shaking it off. Runs back into the huddle.

                    ISAAC
          Hey, man. Look at me...
              (locks in with Kurt)
          Here’s what I know. You were born
          for this moment! You can do this! I
          know you can.

Kurt nods. Pumped. Gets into position.

                    KURT
          Z-42, slot back on two.

NEXT PLAY. Kurt drops back, has protection, fires a BULLET to
Isaac for a gain of 22 yards. Another STRIKE, again to Isaac,
for 13.

IN THE STANDS, Brenda CHEERS. Kurt’s MOM and DAD exchange a
look - so damn proud.

ON THE FIELD, Kurt threads the needle to AZ AKIM, for a first
down.

                    TV ANNOUNCER (O.C.)
          Warner, getting into a nice rhythm
          here. 1st and goal from the 7.

Kurt pump fakes, throws a slant to Faulk that is --

INTERCEPTED BY RAY LEWIS

Kurt sprints back, attempting a tackle. He misses, but one
hand grabs Lewis’ jersey, slowing him down enough for more
Rams to stop him. Lewis PREENS for the audience. Beats his
chest. Mocks Kurt.

                    RAY LEWIS
          Eatin’ you for dinner, rook!

Kurt walks off the field. Deflated. He paces. Losing
confidence.
                                                       101.


Suddenly AN ASSIST runs over to him, holding out a phone.
Kurt takes it, looking up to the PRESS BOX. TO MARTZ. Where
he calls plays from the Eagle’s Nest.

                      KURT
          Yes, sir.

                     MARTZ
          Warner, listen to me. You know why
          I was so hard on you for so long?
              (beat)
          I had to pressure you as much as
          possible. Had to know if you were
          ready. And guess what? You ARE. I
          would never have put you on that
          field if I didn’t believe you were
          a champion. Now get back out there
          and DRIVE. GET IT DONE.

Kurt jumps back to his feet. Let’s go!

NEXT SERIES

Kurt walks to center. Surveys. Takes a breath...

                    KURT
              (to himself)
          You got this.

IN THE STANDS.

                    BRENDA
          You got this.

HIKE! Kurt marches his team downfield. FAST. At the SPEED of
Arena Football.

                    TV ANNOUNCER (O.C.)
          Warner looking very composed. Got
          the Rams back in scoring position.

                    COLOR MAN (O.C.)
          You know he told us before the game
          that even though he hasn’t played
          in the NFL, in the Arena League you
          have to score on every possession.
          He said he loved the speed of the
          game. And he’s bringing that speed
          right now...

Kurt runs the play action to Faulk, then sends a beautiful
HIGH ARCING PASS to the tight end ROLAND WILLIAMS, who
CATCHES IT at the back of the end zone!!
                                                         102.


                    TV ANNOUNCER (O.C.)
          First career TD for Kurt Warner!

IN THE STANDS, Brenda throws her arms around Sue, FREAKING
OUT! Sue beams.

                    SUE
          Can’t argue with that!

AT THE BAR, the place ERUPTS! Hudnutt raises his beer.

AT HOME Zack listens, glued to a radio. Jumping up and down.

ANOTHER QUICK SERIES

KURT to Marshall Faulk for 40 yards.

KURT with a nifty shovel pass to Az Akim for 17 yards.

CLOSE ON KURT - he seems to move in Slo Motion as he scans
the field, past the defense, then fires a bullet to --

ISAAC BRUCE, WHO CATCHES IT for their 2nd touchdown.

Kurt nods to himself, his face focused and alive. He looks to
the stands again, for Brenda. WE SEE HER JUMPING AND
SCREAMING, hugging everyone, unaware Kurt is watching. He
grins to himself, then turns back to the game.

                    TV ANNOUNCER
          Warner is lighting it up here in
          his NFL debut. With completions to
          seven different Rams receivers.

ANOTHER PASS, a gorgeous fade to Tony Holt for a 20 YARD TD.

                    TV ANNOUNCER (O.C.) (CONT'D)
          Touchdown. BAM! Twenty yards! Kurt
          Warner put that right where only he
          could catch it!

                    COLOR MAN
          Rams 27. Ravens 10. With less than
          three minutes left, I think that’s
          gonna seal the deal.

FINAL PLAY. Rams have possession.

IN THE STANDS, Brenda looks at the scoreboard, then to Kurt
on the field. Puts her hands to her face in disbelief. He’s
about to win it!

                    BRENDA
          Oh... My... God.
                                                       103.


ON THE FIELD, Kurt walks up to center. Isaac and the other
players pat him on the head.

                     ISAAC
          This was YOUR GAME Warner. So keep
          that ball!

Kurt smiles, catches the hike, then takes a KNEE to run out
the clock. As the CROWD CHEERS, we cut to -

CLOSE ON KURT’S FACE, through his helmet, down on one knee,
he closes his eyes....

AND EVERYTHING STOPS, ALL SOUND FADES AWAY.

And in this incredible, life changing moment, he silently
prays...

                       KURT
          Thank you.

Then Kurt opens his eyes and EVERYTHING RUSHES BACK. Crazed
fans rush the field. Teammates hug and celebrate.

                    ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
          This game was about one thing...
          Kurt Warner and how well he stood
          up to the pressure.

                    COLOR MAN (O.S.)
          28 of 44. 309 yards. Three
          touchdowns. Incredible! Absolutely
          Incredible!

Players run to Kurt to congratulate him. But he has only one
thing on his mind...

                    KURT
          Brenda!
              (looking for her)
          BRENDA...

WITH THE GAME BALL IN HIS HANDS, he pushes past his
teammates, through the CHAOS, through raving PRESS wanting to
get a comment -- pausing only as Coach Vermeil pats him on
the back and smiles --

                    COACH VERMEIL
          Well done, son. Well done.

                    KURT
          Thank you for believing in me,
          Coach.
                                                       104.


-- and Kurt continues through, fighting against the tide,
searching.

IN THE STANDS, Brenda runs down toward him, calling his name,
racing for the field, where...

KURT FINALLY SPOTS HER --

-- and JUMPS up to the railing. Brenda leans over and Kurt
hands her the winning game ball. She’s absolutely BEAMING.

He draws her in close, face to face. It’s just the two of
them now. He speaks over the crowd, tears in his eyes.

                    KURT (CONT'D)
          I don’t know where we go from here.
          I don’t know what happens next...
          but THIS. We did this. We did it
          TOGETHER!
              (kisses her)
          I LOVE YOU!

Brenda smiles through her own tears.

                    BRENDA
          I love you, too, babe. WE DID IT!

It’s a moment of sheer victory. A lifetime of struggles, of
pain, of dreaming -- as he pulls her in for a KISS. And from
this, we.....



                                          FADE TO BLACK.

But it’s not over yet.

OVER BLACK, sound RUSHES back in. CHEERING CROWDS.
COMMENTATORS, one after the other, each more energetic than
the last, blending into a chorus covering a season of
victories - “THE GREATEST SHOW ON TURF.”

                    TV ANNOUCER 1 (O.S.)
          This is perhaps one of the greatest
          underdog stories in the history of
          sports...

                    TV ANNOUCER 2 (O.S.)
          The Rams, who were all but
          dismissed after the injury of Trent
          Green are now headed to the Super
          Bowl...
                                                             105.


                          TV ANNOUCER 1 (O.S.)
                Kurt Warner, the lowest paid
                athlete in the league and a former
                stock boy has just been named the
                MVP of the Season!

      The CHEERS build and build and BUILD....

                          TV ANNOUCER 2 (O.S.)
                And the Cinderella story of Kurt
                Warner all... comes down... to
                THIS...


129   INT. STADIUM - NIGHT

      Kurt sits on the bench. Just like we met him. ANGLE ON the
      name on his jersey: WARNER. #13.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL.... IT’S THE SUPER BOWL!

      SUPER: SUPER BOWL XXXIV. RAMS VS. TITANS - JANUARY 30, 2000

      Kurt stands. Surveys. Takes a breath. Clutches his rib cage
      in pain. Walks toward the field. Steps up to Coach.

                          COACH VERMEIL
                How’s the ribs?

                          KURT
                Still broken. But we’ve come too
                far not to finish this.

      He looks to the SCOREBOARD that shows the game tied up, 16 to
      16. Two minutes remain. A situation worthy of Dan Marino.

                           COACH VERMEIL
                Damn right! Couldn’t ask for a
                better script. LET’S GO WIN IT
                RIGHT NOW!

      Kurt walks onto the field. A man born for HIS MOMENT. Trades
      a glance with Isaac Bruce.

      FINAL HUDDLE. Kurt takes the snap. Protecting his ribs as he
      steps back, looking for his window.

      KURT POV - things slow down as the Titans’ defense CHARGE
      DIRECTLY FOR HIM, ready to crush him.

      CLOSE ON KURT - as he breathes, staying focused, waiting for
      his moment. FEET PLANTED.

      IN THE STANDS, Brenda watches, just as focused. She whispers.
                                                        106.


                    BRENDA
          Stay in the pocket, Warner...

And he doesn’t budge. Rears back to THROW. Here comes the
rush. Knows he’s gonna take a HIT, and LETS... IT... FLY.

AND IN THIS MOMENT, we quickly FLASH BACK TO KURT AS A KID,
throwing the ball against his house...

JUST AS #90 Jevon Kearse crashes into him. AND KURT HITS THE
GROUND HARD. He quickly sits up and looks. The ball SPINNING
IN THE AIR. OFF THIS --

WE CUT TO ACTUAL GAME FOOTAGE.

And watch as the real Isaac Bruce catches it and runs it into
the endzone. “THE RAMS WIN THE SUPERBOWL!”

WE STAY WITH THE REAL FOOTAGE NOW.

The real Kurt Warner, as he runs to the real Brenda in the
stands. She leans down and he kisses her.

AFTER THE GAME. Kurt talking to reporters. Thanking God.
Thanking his teammates. Thanking Brenda. His family. Raising
the silver Lombardi HIGH INTO THE AIR.

An underdog. A champion.

TEXT OVER BLACK:

Kurt Warner’s touchdown throw in the 1999 Super Bowl broke
Joe Montana’s all time post-season pass record. He was named
the MVP of the game.

The Rams’ 1999 season, known as “The Greatest Show on Turf”,
is still considered one of greatest underdog stories in the
history of sports.

Kurt was inducted into the NFL hall of fame in 2017. He is
widely considered to be the best undrafted NFL player of all
time.

Kurt and Brenda are happily married to this day. They have
seven children.

THEN... one final shot. Home footage of a high school
graduation. It’s Zack, receiving his diploma.

Zack graduated High School in 2012. Proving everyone wrong.
Again.

AND WE END ON the real Kurt and Brenda cheering in the crowd.
