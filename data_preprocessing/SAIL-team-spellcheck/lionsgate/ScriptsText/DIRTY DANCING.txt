EXT. NEW YORK CITY - EVENING

CITY LIGHTS shine. The TWIN TOWERS stand tall. TRAFFIC jams
the streets. The night’s hot. Steam rises. Sweat drips as
PEOPLE jostle for space on crowded sidewalks.

Cabbies shout at pedestrians. MUSIC mingles with CAR HORNS...

SUPER: SUMMER, 1995


INT. SUBWAY STATION - SAME TIME

...as BUSKERS lay down a boiling beat. The cadence echoes off
the brick walls as a TRAIN pulls in, lending its squeaky
clickety-clack sound to the underground tunes.

Some TEENS dance to the pulse of the music, heated young
bodies riding the rhythm.

A few HOT GIRLS breeze through the platform. One drops a few
bills into the busker’s basket. They head toward the train...

...and walk right past a YOUNG COUPLE leaning against a post.
The guy whispers into his girlfriend’s ear. She grins, pulls
his face to hers. As they make out...


INT. SUBWAY TRAIN

...the TRAIN DOORS open. The Hot Girls hop on. Just before
the doors close, the Make-Out-Couple dart inside. The Guy
grabs an overhead strap, pulls his Girl close.

Next to them:

JAKE (19) grips a hand-strap. He’s broody. Scowly. Sexy as
hell. He glances down at a SEALED LETTER in his other hand.


EXT. LONG ISLAND - MIDNIGHT - FLASHBACK

An expansive ELEGANT HOME is being remodeled. The yard is
half-landscaped. A BACKHOE sits near a dirt mound.

The area’s littered with BEER CANS, BOTTLES, and Jake’s
FRIENDS. One climbs into the backhoe, says:

                    DRUNK FRIEND
          Dude. The keys are in here.

The Backhoe’s engine RUMBLE to life. The BUCKET judders up
and down. Jake laughs. Climbs onto the rig.
                                                            2.


                    JAKE
          Get out of there, idiot.

The Drunk Friend hops out. Jake slides into the seat. He
yanks at the levers. His feet work the clutch and gas.

A puff of DUST rises as the backhoe starts to move. His
friends let out a raucous cheer.

The backhoe bucket-teeth punch through the dirt. Jake shifts
the lever and the bucket rises, dirt falling like snow.

                      JAKE (CONT'D)
          Where to?

A SEXY TEEN steps up to the backhoe. She smiles at Jake.

                      SEXY TEEN
          The pool.

A pristine, crystal-blue swimming pool glitters in the
moonlight. More cheers. Jake grins.

                    JAKE
          The pool. You got it.


INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - END FLASHBACK

The train STOPS. Make-Out-Girl stumbles, bumps into Jake.
Whoops! Her Guy pulls her back to him. The doors OPEN.

The Hot Girls eye him. Yummy. Jake grins. Not half bad.

The train stops. The Hot Girls get off. One looks back at
him. Smiles. Maybe he’ll go talk to her. But... the letter.

The doors close. Oh, well. The train LURCHES forward.


EXT. LONG ISLAND ELEGANT HOME - FLASHBACK

BLUE LIGHTS strobe on top of a POLICE CRUISER. A few of the
friends, the ones who didn’t run, loiter near the backhoe...

...which has been driven through the wall of the house.

The cops approach, flashlights shining over the damage.

Then the flashlights find Jake, sitting on a mound of dirt.
Drinking a beer. Not a care in the world.

                    JAKE
          Yo. Whaddup?
                                                          3.


EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE, MANHATTAN - END FLASHBACK

Jake walks past THE LINCOLN CENTER. A group of DANCERS come
out, still in rehearsal gear. They hurry down the stairs.

He slows as the dancers dart around him, his eyes on a
brightly-lit HIGHRISE up ahead. Imposing. Posh.


INT. POSH HIGHRISE - CORRIDOR

Jake checks the gilded door numbers. He looks at the
envelope. Finally, he gets to: APT 1911.

LAUGHTER inside. MUSIC. Jake straightens. KNOCKS. Waits. He’s
about to knock again-- the door opens: a WOMAN (50s).

Jake doesn’t know her. But we do. It’s LISA HOUSEMAN.

                    JAKE
          I, uh, I’ve got this letter for...

He shows her the letter. She stares at it. Then at him.

                    LISA
          What’s your name?


INT. BABY’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM

Lisa drags Jake into the room.

It’s a SMALL PARTY, in full swing. Well-heeled guests laugh
and mingle. Lisa hurries in, pulling Jake behind her.

                    LISA
          You are not going to believe this.

A woman turns. It’s BABY (50s). Time has been good to her.
She’s refined. Sleek. She eyes Jake. He looks familiar.

                    LISA (CONT'D)
          This is Jake Castle. Johnny’s son.

Baby’s face lights up. She hurries toward him.

                    BABY
          I don’t believe it. Johnny’s son?

                    LISA
          Spitting image, right? Jake, this
          is my sister, Frances Houseman.

Ah, okay. Jake holds up the letter.
                                                           4.


                    JAKE
          I have this for you. From my dad.

Baby takes the letter. Grins even wider. The guests are
intrigued by this new bit of excitement. They all watch.

LOLA (13), Baby’s daughter, joins her mom.

                    LOLA
          Who’s Johnny Castle?

She starts to open the envelope.

                    BABY
          Is he here? In the city?

She lifts the flap of the envelope and Jake realizes...

                    JAKE
          You don’t know, do you?

Baby stops opening, looks up. Know what? Jake hesitates for a
brief moment. Then:

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          My dad died. Six years ago. It was
          cancer. I just found that letter
          and wanted to know who you were,
          and how you knew my dad.

                    BABY
          I don’t-- wait, he... what? No. No.

DANIEL (50s), Lola’s dad, puts a hand on Baby’s back.

                      DANIEL
          Francie--

Baby steps sharply away from him. Daniel looks to Lisa. Help?

                    LISA
          Okay, everyone. Johnny... Castle.

Lisa takes center stage, keeping the attention off Baby.

                    LISA (CONT'D)
          Johnny was the love of Baby’s
          teenage life. It was the summer we
          spent at Kellerman’s, that place up
          in the Catskills...

Baby gives her a pleading look. Please don’t. So Lisa pivots.
                                                            5.


                    LISA (CONT'D)
          Um, well, you all know me. I was
          nineteen and determined to find a
          husband.

                    GUEST
          Just the one, Lisa?

Everyone laughs. Everyone except Jake and Baby. He hasn’t
taken his eyes off Baby. She looks pretty broken up.

                    LISA
          So I chased this waiter around all
          summer. Robbie. But he turned out
          to be a real asshole--

                    JAKE
          What about my dad?

                    LOLA
          Yeah. Tell us about Johnny.

Uhhh... Lisa looks to Baby. Baby forces a smile. Jake watches
her closely. So does Daniel.

                    BABY
          Johnny was...

She doesn’t cry, but she can’t speak, either.

                    LISA
          Johnny was a dance instructor.

                    JAKE
          A what? No. My dad was a house
          painter.

                    LISA
          When we knew him, he was a dance
          instructor.

This is news to Jake. The fuck?

                    LOLA
              (whispers to Baby)
          You got it on with the dance
          instructor? Mom, that’s kinda hot.

Baby shakes her head. Trying to process... everything.

Lisa still holds court -- but now she’s carried away. The
guests hang on her every word:
                                                         6.


                    LISA
          He was so good. So was Baby. They
          were like magnets. You couldn’t
          keep them apart. Our parents found
          out and lost their minds. Johnny
          got fired. But he showed up to the
          summer showcase anyway. He grabbed
          Baby and they did this dance number
          that blew everyone away. Even Dad.
          Nobody puts Baby in a corner--

                    BABY
          Yep. And that was the big finish.

She stands abruptly, a trembling smile pasted to her face.
Daniel steps closer to her.

                    DANIEL
          How did I not know any of this?

                    BABY
          Because it was before you. Okay?

Okay. Daniel backs off. Baby goes to Jake.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          I’m-- I didn’t know. I’m so sorry.

The tears threaten again. Jake looks around at the guests.
The mood has gone from jovial to awkward.

                    JAKE
          No, look, I shouldn’t have busted
          in on you like this.


INT. BABY’S APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR

Baby walks him to the door. She’s still spinning, but she’s
got a better handle on it now. Just a little.

                    BABY
          I’m... can I get your phone number?
          I’d like to talk more, but...

She glances back at the guests.

                    JAKE
          Yeah, sure. I guess.

She watches as he walks toward the elevator. DING.
                                                            7.


INT. BABY’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Baby offers goodnights to the guests as they file out. Lisa
hugs her tightly.

                    LISA
              (whispers)
          Call me if you need me, okay? I
          don’t care what time it is.

Baby nods. Lisa starts to leave. Turns back. Gives Baby a
long look, then kisses her cheek.

                    LISA (CONT'D)
          I love you.

She leaves. Closes the door behind her. Baby stares at the
closed door. Turns. Daniel’s still there. She sighs.

                    DANIEL
          You want to talk about it? I can
          stay, if you need some company.

                    BABY
          No, Dan. I know we promised to stay
          friends--

                    DANIEL
          We can still be more than that.

Lola joins them. Gives her dad a hip-bump.

                    LOLA
          You wanna stay and hang out?

                    DANIEL
              (off Baby’s look)
          I don’t think so, hon. You know I
          how I feel about clean-up duty.

Lola laughs. Baby pushes him toward the door.

                    BABY
          ‘Night, Daniel.

She closes the door. Lola’s dying to know:

                    LOLA
          So what happened with you and
          Johnny? After the big showstopper?

                    BABY
          Come on. We’ve got to be up early.
                                                           8.


Lola grumbles and trods away, disappears into the hallway.

Baby leans against the door. Shit.


EXT. DARK HIGHWAY - LATER

A BUS speeds down the road, the city lights far behind.


INT. BUS

Jake sits in the back. Alone.


INT. POLICE STATION - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Jake sits on a BENCH inside the police station.

A couple his friends share looks of “what-the-fuck-ever” with
him as they’re dragged out by their parents.

A cop, PETE (50s), talks with MR. WINSTEAD (60s). Polished.
Wealthy.

Jake’s mom, ANNE (40s), hurries into the station. Tired.
Overworked. She glares at Jake.

                     PETE
           Anne, this is Mr. Winstead, he’s--

                     MR. WINSTEAD
           --the owner of the property.

                     ANNE
           Mr. Winstead. I’m so sorry about my
           son. Jake’s had a rough few years.

Pete puts a hand on Anne’s arm. Too familiar. Jake bristles.

                     PETE
               (quietly to Anne)
           You gotta get a handle on him.

                     JAKE
           “He’s” right here.

Jake stands. Starts to walk past them but--

                     PETE
           Son, wait--

                     JAKE
           Don’t call me son.
                                                            9.


Pete backs off. Winstead gives Jake a long, sympathetic look.

                    MR. WINSTEAD
          I’ve had rough times, too, kid.

Jake’s face reddens. He seethes, humiliated.

                    MR. WINSTEAD (CONT'D)
          If you kids pay for the damages,
          we’ll forget this ever happened.

                    ANNE
          They will. Thank you.

But Jake’s already at the door. She hurries to catch up.

                    ANNE (CONT'D)
          What would your dad think of you?

                    JAKE
          What would he think of you?


INT. BABY’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM

Baby looks through a PHOTO ALBUM, the unopened letter beside
her. She flips through the album.

Stops. Removes a photo.

She stares at it. We don’t see the photo - just her face.


INT. BABY’S BEDROOM

Baby walks past a mirror and sees YOUNG BABY staring back.
Then she’s gone. Baby looks down at the envelope. Opens it.


INT. JAKE’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

Jake comes in. A POLICE UNIFORM SHIRT is draped over an
ironing board. Another shirt hangs nearby.


INT. JAKE’S BEDROOM

Jake opens a nightstand drawer. Takes out a HOSPITAL
WRISTBAND. He runs his thumb over the name: JOHN CASTLE.
                                                           10.


EXT. BABY’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM BALCONY

Baby stares blindly out at the city, the open letter clenched
in her hand. Whatever that letter said, it broke her.


EXT. CHELSEA PIERS INDOOR SPORTS COMPLEX - EARLY NEXT MORNING

A sprawling 28-acre indoor sports and entertainment complex
on the Hudson River.


INT. SPORTS FIELD

A LACROSSE game. Lola’s on the field in her GREEN uniform and
gear. She scoops the ball from the air.


INT. BLEACHERS

Baby sits with several other LACROSSE MOMS. They each wear an
article of clothing in the same green as the girls’ uniforms.

Baby’s in a green top. Fitting right in. But distracted.

DIANE (50s) nudges her.

                    DIANE
          Val tapped you for the charcuterie.

                    BABY
          Oh. I can’t do brunch this weekend.
          I’m sorry. Something’s come up.

                    DIANE
          Okay. Next Sunday, then.

                    LISA (O.S.)
          Give ‘em hell, honey!

Baby looks up as Lisa plops down beside her.

                    BABY
          Hey. Thanks for taking her.

                    LISA
          Oh, please. You know Lola’s
          practically my best friend. We’ll
          make it a girls’ weekend. Hair,
          nails, shows.
              (off Baby’s smirk)
          Don’t act like I’m speaking a
          foreign language. What do you think
          these ladies do all weekend?
                                                          11.


She jerks her head toward the Lacrosse Moms. Baby eyes them.

                    BABY
          I don’t want to be like them.

                    LISA
          You’re not like them.

Baby looks ruefully down at her green shirt. Yes, she is.

                    BABY
          It felt like we were going to live
          forever, didn’t it?

                    LISA
              (gently)
          You read the letter, huh?

                    BABY
          He wanted to see me one last time,
          before he-- and I didn’t--

                    LISA
          Oh, God. Baby.

Baby shakes her head. Force-swallows. She can’t cry here.
Lisa grabs her hand. Grips tightly.

Baby pulls a photo from her purse. It’s the photo Baby took
from the album: Johnny and Baby doing THE LIFT, 1963.

                    BABY
          If I had seen him again... what
          would I have said? About myself?
          What I’m doing now?

Baby stares at her young, idealistic self in the photo.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          That girl would not be sitting
          here, letting herself be drafted to
          bring a meat tray to Sunday brunch.
          I thought I was going to change the
          world. Instead, I ended up just
          like Johnny said I would. A society
          housewife...

                    LISA
          Soon-to-be-ex-housewife.

                    BABY
          ...and I can’t even blame it on
          Dan. It was my choice. I gave up my
          career for him. For my family.
                    (MORE)
                                                        12.

                     BABY (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          I love Lola more than anything,
          but... I’m not me anymore. And I’m
          not going to live forever.

Lisa grabs the photo from Baby. Holds it up to Baby’s face.

                    LISA
          See this girl? You are still
          everything you always were.

Lisa scoots closer. Puts an arm around her.

                    LISA (CONT'D)
          I’m so glad you’re doing this.
          Now you’d better get on the road.

Baby stands, finds Lola on the field. Gives her a wave and
blows her a kiss. Lola waves back. Baby kisses Lisa. Leaves.

Lisa turns to smile at Diane.

                    LISA (CONT'D)
          Meat trays, huh? Are they kosher?


INT. JAKE’S BEDROOM - MID MORNING

Jake zips a DUFFLE BAG. He grabs his WALLET and KEYS.


INT. LIVING ROOM

Anne’s waiting when Jake comes in, bag over his shoulder.

                    ANNE
          Where were you last night?

                    JAKE
          I see Officer Pete slept over.
          Thanks for keeping it down.

                     ANNE
              (beat)
          It’s been six years, Jake. This
          thing with Pete, it doesn’t mean I
          don’t still love your father--

He opens the front door.

                    ANNE (CONT'D)
          Where are you going now?
                                                        13.


                    JAKE
          None of your business.

                    ANNE
          It very much is my business.

That stops him. He turns.

                    JAKE
          Who is Frances Houseman? I found
          the letter Dad wrote to her. The
          one you never sent.

Anne falters. Last thing she expected him to say.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          You want to know where I was last
          night? I was with Frances. I gave
          her the letter.

                    ANNE
          No. You didn’t.

He stares her down. Yes. He did.

                    ANNE (CONT'D)
          How dare you go behind my back--

                    JAKE
          It was hers!

                    ANNE
          Everything was hers! His hopes, his
          dreams. But she let him go and I...
              (fights sudden tears)
          No, I didn’t mail the letter. I
          couldn’t let her have his pain,
          too. That, at least, was mine.

Pete walks in. Looks like he just woke up.

                    PETE
          Hey. Everything okay?

                    JAKE
          Just headed out for a few days.
          Make yourself at home, Officer.

Through the open door, Anne sees a SILVER MERCERDES pull up.

                    ANNE
          Who is that?
                                                           14.


EXT. JAKE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Jake walks out, Anne right behind him. She freezes as the car
door opens and Baby steps out. Anne stares. Baby stares back.

                    JAKE
          I’m going to Kellerman’s with
          Frances. Turns out, Dad used to be
          a dancer. Who knew?

                    ANNE
          Jake, wait--


EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER

Baby’s car speeds along.


INT. BABY’S CAR

                    BABY
          Your mom seemed upset. I hope she’s
          okay with this trip.

                    JAKE
          She’s just doing her usual
          pissed-at-me thing.

                    BABY
          What is she, uh, pissed about? If
          you don’t mind my asking.

For a moment, she thinks he’s not going to answer. Then:

                    JAKE
              (shrugs)
          I was hanging out at a building
          site with some friends and I
          accidentally drove a backhoe
          through a wall. Now she wants me to
          come up with three thousand dollars
          to pay for “my part” of the
          damages.

                    BABY
          I’m guessing you weren’t supposed
          to be there.

                    JAKE
              (laughs now)
          Hey, it’s not my fault. The gate
          was open. Keys were in the backhoe.
                                                          15.


Baby glances at him. Jake gives zero fucks about what he did.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          So you and my dad, huh? Just a
          summer fling?

Jake gives her a long once over. She’s high-class. Luxury
car, the CAR PHONE mounted on the console. Rich.

                    BABY
          No. We tried. We were-- it was hard
          to stay connected.

                    JAKE
          Mom said you let him go.

                    BABY
          We just had different... lives.

                    JAKE
          Yeah. You have a phone in your car.

                     BABY
              (beat)
          That wasn’t the only difference.

They go quiet. It’s kind of awkward.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          So. What about you? College?

                    JAKE
          Some Army base, I guess. It’s the
          best option for someone like me.

                    BABY
          Someone like you?

                      JAKE
          You know.

                    BABY
          There’s nothing you want? No
          dreams? No goals?

                    JAKE
          I don’t do goals. I do easy.

She doesn’t like the sound of that. But she lets it go.
                                                        16.


EXT. SAUGERTIES, NY - LATE AFTERNOON

Baby’s car drives through a small, idyllic town. They pass a
ROAD SIGN: SAUGERTIES, NY.

                    JAKE
          Where the hell are we?


EXT. WINDING ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

Baby’s car winds up the road to Kellerman’s. In the distance,
the resort sprawls over the serene countryside.


INT. BABY’S CAR

Baby’s eyes catch the sign: KELLERMAN’S... and faintly, WE
HEAR the opening beats of BE MY BABY. Like a memory. Like a
heartbeat. Then it’s gone. Baby pulls the car over. Gets out.


EXT. ROAD ABOVE KELLERMAN’S

From this vantage, Baby can see all of Kellerman’s: HOTEL,
GROUNDS, GAZEBOS, DOCKS, LAKE. Jake steps up beside her.

                    JAKE
          Damn. That’s Kellerman’s?

Baby stares down at the resort. At her past.


INT. KELLERMAN’S RESORT - MAIN LOBBY - MINUTES LATER

BRIDESMAIDS rush through the lobby toward an open BALLROOM.
They line up beside a handful of GROOMSMEN.

Jake looks around. Okay, he’s impressed. Baby comes over.

                    JAKE
          Did it always look like this?

                    BABY
          Pretty much. Minus the bridesmaids.

She hands Jake a ROOM KEY. Glances around. It’s exactly the
same. Everything. Almost as if she walked back in time.


EXT. KELLERMAN’S - MOMENTS LATER

A CONSTRUCTION CREW works on several new outdoor areas. A
huge new gazebo has begun to take shape on the lake.
                                                           17.


Jake stands on the veranda, watches the action. He spots:

CAMILA (19). An exotic beauty. Walking right toward him. She
trots up the stairs. He puts on his sexiest bad-boy grin:

                      JAKE
          Hey. Hi--

She looks at him. He’s hot. But she immediately shuts it
down. Smiles politely, but not warmly.

                    CAMILA
          Group lessons will be at the
          pavilion at five. Excuse me.

She joins CARLOS (17) at the front lobby doors. Carlos grins
at Jake. Camila takes his hand.

Baby steps up beside Jake. Her eyes roam the grounds.

                    BABY
          Beautiful, isn’t it?

He’s still looking at Camila. She and Carlos go inside.

                    JAKE
          Sure is. See you later.

He heads inside. Baby watches him go. Um, okay. She turns to
look at the lake. She’s really back.


EXT. NATURE PATH - MOMENTS LATER

Baby walks. Deep in thought. Finds herself at:


INT. OLD GAZEBO - CONTINUOUS

Baby stands on the exact spot where she confronted her father
so many years ago. You let me down, too.

She reverently touches the railing.


INT. MAIN RESORT, BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Music drifts out. Camila and Carlos are dancing together.
Jake doesn’t recognize the dance, but they’re really good.
Camila stops. Gives Carlos a correction. They dance again.

Jake leans against the doorframe, watching them. Wow. He
stares at Camila. Not hiding his interest. Carlos whispers:
                                                         18.


                    CARLOS
          Ooooh, my. You have an admirer.

Camila glances at Jake. He smiles at her. She ignores him.

                    CARLOS (CONT'D)
          He’s awfully cute.
              (no response from Camila)
          More than cute. He’s hot.
              (still no response)
          Maybe he’s looking at me?
              (that gets a chuckle)
          Hey, it could happen.

He spins Camila out to face Jake. He is insanely hot. She
stops dancing. Goes to the door.

                    CAMILA
          Sorry. This is a closed rehearsal.

She closes the door in his face.

                    CARLOS
          So hot you had to kick him out?

                     CAMILA
          Shut up.


EXT. LITTLE BRIDGE

                    JOHNNY (V.O.)
          You’re not scared of anything...

Baby steps onto the bridge, looks out at the water. At
Kellerman’s, on the hill. Her eyes go distant, remembering:

                    YOUNG BABY (V.O.)
          Me?! I’m scared of everything...

She crosses the little bridge until she gets to:


EXT. STONE STEPS

They’re exactly as she left them. She touches a handrail.

                    YOUNG BABY (V.O.)
          What I saw. What I did. Who I am...

She takes a moment, lets the memories wash over her...
                                                          19.


EXT. OLD STAFF CABINS

...as she stops in front of the STAFF CABINS. She looks
across to JOHNNY’S CABIN. Old. Weathered. But still standing.

She stares as the door opens and a YOUNG BABY walks down the
steps, followed by a shirtless Johnny.

                    YOUNG BABY (V.O.)
          And most of all...

Baby walks toward the memory...


EXT. JOHNNY’S OLD CABIN

Baby opens the door... and walks inside.


INT. JOHNNY'S OLD CABIN

The cabin’s been vacant awhile. Basic furniture: Bed. Chair.
Steamer trunk. Standing mirror.

Baby takes it all in. She touches the chair. Hesitantly sits.

                    YOUNG BABY (V.O.)
          ...I’m scared of walking out of
          this room and never feeling again,
          in my whole life, the way I feel
          when I’m with you.

She stares into the mirror. Looking for Young Baby. But only
Frances stares back.


EXT. MAIN RESORT - LATER

Camila and Carlos step out as a 1955 PORSCHE 550 SPYDER
roars up the driveway. Carlos gawks.

                    CARLOS
          Dios mio. Do you see that?

The car stops right in front of them. MR. STANTON (50s) gets
out. He has that old-money arrogance about him. Sees Carlos:

                    STANTON
          Appreciate it.

He tosses Carlos his CAR KEYS. Carlos grins. Sweet!

                    CAMILA
          He’s not the valet.
                                                          20.


                    CARLOS
          Oh, it’s no trouble. I can park it.

                    CAMILA
          No. I’m sorry about the confusion.

She gives Mr. Stanton his keys. The VALET, a young Latino
man, hurries up to the car.

                    VALET
          Good evening, sir.

Mr. Stanton gives him the keys without a second glance.


EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION - EARLY EVENING

Guests gather for the group dance class. Some have already
paired off and are dancing to the upbeat music.


EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION, AT RAILING

Baby and Jake stand at the railing. Jake checks his watch.
Not quite 5:00. No Camila yet.

                    BABY
          I used to be pretty good at this.
          Come on, dance with me.

Jake hesitates. Baby pulls him onto the dance area.


EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION, DANCE AREA

Baby pulls Jake’s arms up. Nudges his elbows.

                    BABY
          Look at that. Spaghetti arms.

She makes a circle with his arms and steps into them. They
dance. Jake’s not bad.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          See? You’re a natural.

Baby’s having a great time. Jake smiles, too.

NOAH (27), handsome and charming, taps Jake’s shoulder.

                    NOAH
          Mind if I cut in?

Jake looks to Baby.
                                                          21.


                      BABY
          Um, sure.

Jake hands her over to Noah. Heads off the dance floor. Noah
pulls Baby into his arms.

                    NOAH
          I could tell as soon as you stepped
          onto the floor, you knew what you
          were doing. Your form. It’s lovely.

                    BABY
          Well, it’s been a really long time.

                    NOAH
          It’ll come back to you. Lemme help.

He pulls her closer. He’s an experienced dancer. Skilled.
Baby moves with him. Okay, she’s got this.


EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION, AT RAILING

Jake watches Baby dance with Noah. A handful of BEAUTIFUL
GIRLS sidle up beside him.

                    BEAUTIFUL GIRL
          Do you have a partner yet?

Jake gives the girls a rakish grin.

                    JAKE
          Yeah. I’m waiting for her.

They all pout. Then Camila and Carlos arrive.


EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION, ON DANCEFLOOR

Baby’s dance with Noah has taken on some heat. Noah pulls her
even closer. Baby misses a step. Laughs at herself.

                    BABY
          I was better when I was younger.

                    NOAH
          You’re perfect now.

Baby falters. Suddenly awkward. Unsure. Is he flirting?

                    BABY
          You know what? I think I’m going
          to, um, get a drink. I’ll see ya.
                                                           22.


Noah lets her go, a bit reluctantly.


EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION, AT RAILING

Jake can’t take his eyes off Camila. Carlos walks up to him:

                    CARLOS
          Hola, cabron. Keep your eyes where
          they belong, eh?

                    JAKE
          She your girlfriend or something?

Carlos stares Jake down. Or he tries to. Jake stares back.

                    CARLOS
              (caves with a chuckle)
          She’s my sister. Camila. I’m
          Carlos.

                    CAMILA (O.S.)
          Okay! Everyone find a partner.

Jake grins. Pushes off the railing. Heads toward Camila.

                    CARLOS
          Oh, man. She is gonna hate you.


EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION, ON DANCEFLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Jake stops in front of Camila. Holds out his hand. Music
starts. A long beat, then she cooly steps into his arms.

                    JAKE
          Right on time. I’m Jake.

                    CAMILA
          Welcome to Kellerman’s, Jake.

                    JAKE
          Thank you, Camila.

She fits perfectly in his arms. She feels it. Too much. She
pulls away, keeping space between their bodies.

                    CAMILA
          You sure you don’t want to dance
          with one of your friends?

The Beautiful Girls sneer at her from the railing.
                                                        23.


                    JAKE
          They’re not my friends.

She doesn’t believe him. She leads him into a turn.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          I’d like for you to be my friend.

                    CAMILA
          I don’t fraternize with the guests.

                    JAKE
          Well, I’m not really a--

                    BABY (O.S.)
          Jake!

Baby makes her way through the crowded pavilion.

She has two drinks. Camila smiles at Jake. Walks away. Jake
stares after her. Then he looks to Carlos, who’s laughing.


INT. MAIN RESORT, DINING ROOM - THAT EVENING

The layout and decor haven’t changed since 1963. Jake watches
a WAITER deliver a pasta dish to a table nearby.

                    JAKE
          I should have ordered that.

Baby follows his gaze. Looks past the table to the BAR AREA.
Noah watches her. He smiles. Raises his drink.

Baby pulls her eyes away. She looks at Jake. So familiar.

                    BABY
          You’re so much like him, you know.

                    JAKE
          I’ve heard.

                    BABY
          What was your relationship like?
          With Johnny? Were you close?

                    JAKE
          I thought we were. But I guess not.
          He never told me he spent his
          summers in a lush place like this,
          dancing. Must’ve been nice.
                                                           24.


                    BABY
          It wasn’t paradise for him, trust
          me. He just wanted to dance, but--

                      JAKE
          Whatever.

                     BABY
              (beat)
          Why did you come with me? If not to
          hear about Johnny?

                    JAKE
          To get away from my mom.

                    BABY
          I don’t believe you.

She studies him. Looking so deeply that he has to look away.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          You brought a six year old letter
          to the middle of Manhattan, to find
          out who I was to your dad. But you
          don’t care. Right.
              (off his brooding scowl)
          I’ve known guys like you. I knew
          one guy who was just like you.

Jake looks up. Does she mean...? She nods.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          I’m going to show you around
          tomorrow. So, no disappearing act.

Jake shrugs. Her eyes hold his until...

The waiter arrives at their table with a DRINK for Baby.

                    WAITER
          From the gentleman at the bar.

Baby’s eyes shoot to Noah.

                    JAKE
          Yeah, I’m out.

He stands. Starts to walk away.

                      BABY
          Jake.
                                                        25.


                    JAKE
              (long beat)
          You win, Frances. Tomorrow.

He leaves. Baby sees Noah stand. He smiles and heads her way.
But Baby gets up. Walks out.


EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT

Jake follows the sound of MUSIC to a LARGE CLEARING on the
far side of the lake. The area is lit by STRING LIGHTS and
LANTERNS, crowded with people laughing and dancing.

In the distance, a LIGHTHOUSE BEACON shines over the water.


EXT. LAKESIDE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

Jake makes his way through the crowd. All young people who
work there: WAITSTAFF. CATERING. HOUSEKEEPING.

Everyone’s dancing. It’s hot. Humid. Sticky bodies entwined.

Camila and Carlos are dancing the Mambo as if they created
it. A perfect unit. Carlos sees Jake. So does Camila.

                    CARLOS
          Lookie lookie.

                    CAMILA
          He’s a hotel guest. He’s not
          supposed to be down here.

                    CARLOS
          Why don’t you just talk to him?

                    CAMILA
          No distractions. Not now.

                    CARLOS
          But he’s just standing there.
          Looking so... him.

                    CAMILA
          You want me to talk to him? Fine.

She STOPS dancing. Carlos sighs.

A few other couples stop dancing to see what’s up. Camila
makes sure they’re watching before she walks up to Jake:

                    CAMILA (CONT'D)
          What do you want?
                                                           26.


Wow. She’s even more beautiful tonight. Her scowl. Her
flashing eyes. He smiles, and steps close to her. Very close.

                    JAKE
          Pretty sure I already got it.

                    CAMILA
          Yeah? What’s that?

                    JAKE
          Your attention.

Somebody WHOOPS. A catcall. Camila’s face FLAMES.


EXT. NATURE PATH - MOMENTS LATER

Camila hurries home. Furious. Carlos follows her, laughing.

                    CARLOS
          Slow down. I can’t keep up.

                    CAMILA
          Die out here, then.

                    CARLOS
          Come on. That was amazing.

                    CAMILA
          What? My humiliation?

                    CARLOS
          He didn’t humiliate you. You tried
          to humiliate him and he wouldn’t
          let you. Now you’re mad about it.
              (starts to laugh again)
          And that’s really funny.


INT. NEW GAZEBO - SAME TIME

Moonlight shines through the naked roof beams. Baby stands at
the railing. Music drifts to her. Laughter.

She leans out. Sees the string-lights and dancing at the
lakeside clearing. Kids having fun.

She looks over the water. A soft breeze picks up. She closes
her eyes, as if waiting for...

Nothing happens. She opens her eyes. Turns to leave.
                                                           27.


INT. JAKE’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Jake lies in bed. Johnny’s hospital wristband in his hand. He
stares at it.


INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

It’s a SMALL SUITE, with a tiny living area, separate bedroom
and separate bath.


INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM, LIVING ROOM AREA

Baby’s in a chair by the window. Johnny’s letter in her hand.


EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS, VARIOUS LOCATIONS - LATE NIGHT

Quiet. Peaceful. The front lawn shines in the moonlight.
String-lights twinkle over empty pavilions.

The LIGHTHOUSE BEACON makes a sweeping journey over the
rippling water, the silent staff-party area, then it’s gone.


EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - EARLY NEXT MORNING

Summer sun shines on the resort. Guests breakfast on an
outdoor patio, paddle canoes on the water, play lawn games.

The construction crew unload LUMBER from a truck, prepping
for their workday. A few 2 x 12s clatter to the ground.


INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

The envelope lies on the floor, Johnny’s handwriting lit by
the morning sun shining in the window. A half-empty glass of
wine sits on a side table, the open bottle next to it.

And still in the chair, letter in her hand: Baby. Asleep. She
wakes to the loud BANG of the dropped lumber. She sits up.


INT. MAIN RESORT LOBBY - SAME TIME

Jake walks toward the front doors--

                    CONCIERGE (O.S.)
          Excuse me. Mr. Castle?

Jake turns. The Concierge holds up a stack of message slips.
                                                          28.


EXT. NEW GAZEBO - MOMENTS LATER

A CREW is building a HUGE GAZEBO. Jake steps over a half-laid
BRICK PATH, flips through the messages. All from Anne:

CALL ME.
WINSTEAD IS CALLING.
URGENT! CALL ME NOW.

PAUL, the Foreman, walks to greet Jake:

                       PAUL
             Morning. Were we too loud?

Jake shakes his head, then nods to the framed-out gazebo.

                       JAKE
             What’s it for?

                       PAUL
             Big society wedding. We’re sprucing
             the whole place up, top to toe.
             Killing ourselves to get it all
             done in time, if we even can.

Jake sees Camila and Carlos run toward the Main Resort.
Carlos waves. Camila snatches his hand from the air.

Jake laughs, looks down at the messages. A sudden thought:

                       JAKE
             Sounds like you could use an extra
             pair of hands. My dad was a house
             painter, so I practically grew up
             on construction sites. You hiring?


INT. MAIN RESORT, LOBBY

Neil gives Camila a thick MANILA PACKET.

                       NEIL
             The Silvermans. You know the name.

Camila opens the packet. Pulls out PHOTOS: ISABEL and ARIEL.

                       NEIL (CONT'D)
             Isabel and her lovely daughter
             Ariel. These are our big fish. Make
             them happy, you have jobs for life.

He leaves.
                                                        29.


                    CAMILA
          Jobs for life. Shoot me now.

                    CARLOS
          Speak for yourself. Not all of us
          have dreams of fancy dance schools.

She reads the Silverman’s PREFERENCE SHEET. Sighs.

                    CAMILA
          Why do they always want the Mambo?
          They can’t ever do it right.


EXT. MAIN RESORT, VERANDA

Baby drinks a cup of coffee. Jake trots up the steps.

                    JAKE
          How was your big night?
              (off Baby’s huh? look)
          With Mr. Dancy-pants, buy-a-girl-a-
          drink? I think he likes you.

                    BABY
          Good morning to you.

Jake’s quiet for a moment. Then:

                    JAKE
          Look, I do want to be here, okay?

That’s the closest to an apology she’s going to get.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          And I got a job.

                    BABY
          What? Here?

                    JAKE
          On the construction crew. I gotta
          pay that money back.

                    BABY
          And it has nothing to do with a
          certain dance instructor? Can’t
          blame you. I know how that can be--

                    NEIL (O.S.)
          Somebody pinch me, I must be
          dreaming. Is that Baby Houseman?

She pastes on a friendly smile. Turns.
                                                         30.


                    BABY
          Neil Kellerman. Look at you.

                    NEIL
          Baby. How have you been?

                    BABY
          I’m not really “Baby” anymore.

                    NEIL
          Oh. Of course. Frances. What’s got
          you up here? Old times’ sake?

                    BABY
          Neil, this is Jake Castle. Johnny’s
          son. You remember Johnny?

                    NEIL
          Everyone remembers Johnny.

It’s clear Neil’s memories are NOT fond. He looks Jake over.

                    NEIL (CONT'D)
          I guess Baby, er, Frances told you
          your dad was one of the most
          “sought after” instructors here?
          Never had any trouble finding
          partners, that’s for sure.

That sounds a lot like a put-down. Jake looks to Baby.

                    BABY
          Johnny’s been dead six years, Neil.

                    NEIL
          Oh. I didn’t-- I-- damn. Sorry,
          kid. I was just-- damn, I--


EXT. LITTLE BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER

Jake follows Baby across the bridge, toward the stone steps.

                    JAKE
          What did he mean? About my dad?

She trots up the stone steps. Jake follows.


EXT. JOHNNY’S OLD CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

Jake glances at it. Catches up with her.
                                                          31.


                    JAKE
          You said something, too. About it
          not being good for him here.

Baby looks up at the cabin, then sits on a step.

                    BABY
          This was his cabin. Every summer he
          was here, this is where he stayed.

That stops Jake. A quick, intense reverence washes over him.

                       BABY (CONT'D)
          Come here.

He sits beside her. A tiny crack in his tough guy act.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          Your dad was beautiful. And the
          women here, they were older,
          wealthy. They could buy anything
          they wanted. And they did.

                    JAKE
          Wait-- you said he was a dance
          instructor.

                    BABY
          He was. But those women, one
          complaint could cost him his job.
          So Johnny made sure they didn’t
          have a reason to complain.

That’s heavy news for Jake. He eyes Baby.

                    JAKE
          Did you... buy him, too?

                    BABY
          No. What we had was real. So real.

A few bars of CRY TO ME drift around her. She gives the
memory the barest moment, then shakes it off.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          You want to go inside?

Jake looks at the cabin, the new information about his dad
spinning through his mind. He shakes his head. No.

                    JAKE
          Maybe that’s why he never told me
          about dancing. And Kellerman’s.
                                                           32.


                    BABY
          Maybe.
              (she stands)
          Come on. I want to show you the
          rehearsal cabin. That’s where we
          spent most of our time.

Jake gives her a look. She laughs.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          Dancing. Most of our time dancing.


INT. UPSTAIRS REHEARSAL CABIN

It’s now used for storage: WIGS. COSTUME RACKS. PROPS. RECORD
PLAYERS. AN OLD VIDEO PROJECTOR. Stacks and stacks of BOXES.

                    BABY
              (frustrated)
          Who put all this shit in here?

                      JAKE
          You okay?

                    BABY
          You don’t understand. This is where
          your dad danced. Where he taught
          people to come alive. It’s where I--
          Now it’s just a room full of junk.

She shoves a stack of boxes. One falls. 8MM VIDEO REELS roll
onto the floor. Jake picks one up one of the reels.

She sees an open box. VINYL ALBUMS. On the top: “Love Is
Strange” and Other Bests by Mickey & Sylvia.

A long beat. Then Baby reverently picks it up.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          He loved dancing. I wish you could
          have seen him, the way he moved.

Jake doesn’t say it, but so does he.

She puts the album back in the box. Closes the lid. Jake
watches her. She really loved him.


EXT. OUTSIDE EATING AREA - AFTERNOON

Baby and Jake finish their lunch.
                                                        33.


                    JAKE
          Can I ask you something? It’s kind
          of a favor. I’m gonna be spending
          the rest of the summer here, so I
          was wondering if you’d ask Neil if
          I could bunk in one of the, um,
          older cabins.

                    BABY
          One of the old-- you mean...
          Johnny’s cabin?

Jake shrugs, tries not to look too hopeful.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          I think that’s a great idea, Jake.
          I’ll talk to Neil.

                    JAKE
          Sweet. I’ll go pack.

He gets up, leaves. Baby watches him go. So much like Johnny.

                    NOAH (O.S.)
          Was it the dance? Or the drink?

She looks up at him. He sits down across from her, pulls out
a small notepad and a pen. Ready to take notes.

                    NOAH (CONT'D)
          Really, I want to know. I gotta get
          these things right. Can’t go around
          offending beautiful women.

He waits. And waits. Finally, she smiles:

                    BABY
          First...
              (off his expectant nod)
          ...introduce yourself.

                    NOAH
          See? I knew there was something.

She laughs. Looks him over. Adorable.


EXT. JOHNNY’S CABIN - EARLY EVENING

Jake hurries up the steps, his duffel bag over his shoulder.
He puts his hand on the screen door handle. Pulls...
                                                        34.


INT. JOHNNY'S / JAKE’S CABIN - CONTINUOUS

...and takes a reverent step inside. He stands still, as if
trying to feel his dad’s presence. He doesn’t.

He laughs at himself. Stupid. He drops his bag on the bed.
Looks up at a quiet KNOCK on the screen door. It’s Carlos.

                    CARLOS
          Heard you’re on the crew now. Oof,
          this cabin, though... what’d you do
          to piss off old man Kellerman?

                    JAKE
          It was my dad’s cabin. He used to
          work here. As the dance instructor.

                    CARLOS
          No shit. When?

                    JAKE
          Million years ago.


EXT. NEW GAZEBO, ROOF - SUNDOWN

Jake and Carlos sit in the half-built rafters, legs dangling.

                    JAKE
          Now she’s screwing this cop. Pete.
          He was Dad’s friend. And I’m like,
          does it have to be someone he knew?

                    CARLOS
          Yeah. Screw a stranger, lady.

                     JAKE
          Exactly!
              (beat)
          So. How can I get your sister to
          talk to me?

                    CARLOS
          Dude. That was the worst segue.

                    JAKE
          It was. My bad.

                    CARLOS
          You can’t. She’s focused on this
          scholarship audition she’s got for
          Tisch, the dance school at NYU. All
          she does is work and rehearse.
                                                         35.


                    JAKE
          Doesn’t leave much room for fun.

                    CARLOS
          You’re telling me. I’m her partner.

Jake stands up, inches his way toward the edge of a beam.

                    CARLOS (CONT'D)
          Whoa. What are you doing?

                    JAKE
          Getting down.

                    CARLOS
          Jake. Waitaminute--

But Jake’s already pulling off his shirt. He launches himself
off and back-flips into the water. He comes up, shakes the
hair from his face. Carlos stares down at him.

                     JAKE
          Come on!

                    CARLOS
          I can’t get hurt. Camila needs me--

                    JAKE
          It’s water, Carlos. Jump.

Carlos gingerly gets to his feet. Takes off his shirt.
Then... he JUMPS. Splashes into the water beside Jake.


EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS

Jake and Carlos walk across the lawn. The Spyder roars up,
idles in front of the Main Resort. Carlos’s eyes go dreamy.

                    CARLOS
          James Dean had a Porsche Spyder. I
          saw him in Rebel Without a Cause
          and that’s when I knew.

                    JAKE
          That you wanted a Porsche?

                    CARLOS
          That I wanted--
              (catches himself)
          A Porsche. Like James Dean... had.

Carlos pales. Jake lets him play it off. Mr. Stanton gets out
of the car. Sees Carlos... and tosses him the keys.
                                                         36.


                    STANTON
          Take it easy with her.

Carlos stares down at the keys. Mr. Stanton is already
walking inside. Carlos starts to say something, but:

                    JAKE
          Come on. Quick spin.

Jake gets in the passenger side. Waits for Carlos.

                    CARLOS
          No way. You’re nuts.

                    JAKE
          What would James Dean do?

Jake grins. Carlos looks around. Fuck it. He hops in.


INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM

She stands in front of the mirror. She looks amazing. Outfit.
Hair. Makeup. All perfection. She grabs her room key.


INT. MAIN RESORT, DINING ROOM BAR - MOMENTS LATER

Noah looks up as she comes in. Beautiful. He’s about to tell
her so when she says:

                    BABY
          This is not a date. Just dinner.

                    NOAH
          And maybe a dance?

As they’re walking to their table:

                    BABY
          That was a great pivot today.

                    NOAH
          Don’t know what you mean.

                    BABY
          Yes, you do. I was an attorney for
          years. I admire a good change of
          tactic. Could have been a bit
          smoother, though.

                    NOAH
          Let me get out my notepad.
                                                        37.


EXT. WINDING ROAD

The Spyder speeds along the curves. Top down. Music blaring.

                    CARLOS
          Whoooooooo hooooo!

Carlos takes a curve. Grips the wheel. Excited and nervous.

                    CARLOS (CONT'D)
          We’re gonna be in so much trouble.

                    JAKE
          Nah. My friend’s a valet. We do
          this all the time.


INT. MAIN RESORT, DINING ROOM

Baby and Noah linger over dessert. They’re laughing.

                    NOAH
          Just like that? Problem solved?

                    BABY
          Uh, no. We were weeks in court. But
          yeah, eventually, problem solved.

Noah goes to pour more wine. Baby covers her glass.

                    NOAH
          Sounds like you were an amazing
          attorney. And now? What do you do?

                     BABY
          I’m not sure anymore.
              (beat)
          God. I need to stop talking.

                    NOAH
          Okay. Dancing then.

                    BABY
          I think we already know how that’s
          going to go.

He stands. Offers his hand.

                    NOAH
          Life’s all about second chances.
                                                        38.


INT. MAIN RESORT, DINING ROOM, DANCE FLOOR

It’s a bluesy slow song. Baby steps into his arms. Already
feeling the nerves.

                    NOAH
          Trust yourself.

Baby scoffs self-consciously.

                    NOAH (CONT'D)
          Trust me, then.

                    BABY
              (long beat)
          Listen, please don’t get the wrong
          idea, Noah. I’m not...

                    NOAH
          I just want one good dance.

He pulls her close. Starts to move.


EXT. WINDING ROAD

The Porsche is half on the road, half in a shallow ditch. The
boys are behind the car, hands on the bumper. Jake laughs.

                    CARLOS
              (terrified)
          We’re screwed.

                    JAKE
          It’s fine. We didn’t hurt it. We’ll
          get it on the road and back to
          Kellerman’s. Ready? One, two--

Carlos pushes too early. Too hard. His foot slips. He yelps.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          You’re supposed to wait for three.

Carlos grabs his ankle.

                    CARLOS
          I twisted it. Ow, shit.

He tries to stand up. Ow. Ow ow ow.

                    CARLOS (CONT'D)
          Cami’s gonna kill me.
                                                          39.


                    JAKE
          Come on, you’re okay--

A CAR stops on the road. A POLICE CRUISER. The doors open.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Hey. Heads up.

Jake hefts Carlos to his feet. Carlos stares at the cops.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Just be cool. We’re fine.

The cops study Carlos... the car... Carlos. Jake flashes an
easy, carefree grin. This is familiar territory for him.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Hey, guys, thanks for stopping, but
          we’re all good here. Tires got a
          little slick, that’s all.

                    COP
              (to Carlos)
          License and registration.

Carlos looks to Jake.

                    COP (CONT'D)
          Don’t look at him. Look at me.
          License and registration. Now.

                    CARLOS
          Sir-- I don’t have--

                    COP
          You got a green card? Anything?

                    CARLOS
          I... was born here. Sir.

                    COP
          This your car?

                    CARLOS
          No-- no, sir, but--

                    JAKE
          This is a simple misunderstanding,
          Officers. The car belongs to a
          friend of mine and we were just
          returning it. We don’t need to take
          up any more of your night.

The cops ignore Jake. They’re focused solely on Carlos.
                                                         40.


                    COP
              (to Carlos)
          Is. This. Your. Car?


INT. MAIN RESORT CORRIDOR - LATER

Baby lets herself into her room.


INT. BABY'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Closes the door. Goes to the mirror. As she brushes her hair,
she smiles at her reflection. It wasn’t a terrible night.


INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Baby opens and closes drawers. All empty. She zips her
suitcase-- RING RING. The telephone.

The bedside CLOCK reads: One o’clock. She grabs the phone.

                    BABY
          Hello?


EXT. SAUGERTIES POLICE STATION - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Baby’s silver Mercedes is parked in the lot, beside an old
PICK UP TRUCK. The station door opens.

Baby comes out, followed by Carlos’s parents: ESME and JULIO,
both 40s. Behind them, Jake and Carlos.

Carlos limps. Leaning on Jake.

                    JAKE
              (whispers)
          Dude, are you gonna be okay? They
          don’t look too happy.

                    CARLOS
          I’m more worried about Cami when
          she finds out I can’t dance.


INT. BABY’S CAR - ON THE WAY BACK TO KELLERMAN’S

                    JAKE
          Calm down, it’s not a big deal.
          We’ll get, like, a warning maybe.
                                                        41.


                    BABY
          I’m starting to understand your
          mother’s usual pissed-at-you thing.

                    JAKE
          It’s not like we stole it.

                    BABY
          Was it your car?

                      JAKE
          No, but--

                    BABY
          Then you stole it.
              (doesn’t want to admit it)
          But you’re right. They’ll probably
          just let you off with a warning.


EXT. MAIN RESORT - MOMENTS LATER

Baby’s car pulls up to the front. Jake gets out. Slams the
door. Walks toward the Nature Trail. Baby gets out.

                    BABY
          Jake. I’m leaving in the morning.

He stops and turns, sullen. He knows he should say goodbye,
he should thank her, and he wants to. But:

                      JAKE
          Okay.

Baby watches him go. That’s all? She sighs, looks for the
Valet. Another young Latino staffer walks by. That’s not him.

                    VALET (O.S.)
          Right here. Sorry, ma’am.

He hurries toward her from the lawn. She gives him her keys.


INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM - EARLY NEXT MORNING

Baby’s overnight case is open on the bed. Packed and ready to
go. She puts Johnny’s letter inside. Closes the case.


EXT. NEW GAZEBO - SAME TIME

A CREW works on the new brick path. Jake, in a RED CREW WORK
SHIRT, pushes a wheelbarrow loaded with bricks.
                                                          42.


EXT. MAIN RESORT

Baby walks out, carrying her overnight case. Her car is
there, waiting. She puts the case in the trunk. Overhears:

                    CARLOS (O.S.)
          I’m just trying to apologize--

She turns. Nearby: Carlos and Mr. Stanton. Carlos is on
crutches, a MEDICAL BOOT on his foot.

                    STANTON
          I suggest you get an attorney.

Baby walks over.

                    BABY
          You’re pressing charges? For what?
          I understand you’re upset, but he
          didn’t mean anything by it. Your
          car is okay. Not even a scratch.

                    STANTON
          Kids like him are all the same.
          Better to get them off the streets
          when they’re young.

                    BABY
          Kids like him? What does that mean?

                    STANTON
          What is this about? Do I know you?

Baby looks to Carlos. He looks like he might cry any second.

                    BABY
          I’m his attorney.


INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

She’s unpacking. On the phone.

                    BABY
          ...a few more weeks, at least.
          There’ll be an arraignment-- yes, I
          can do this, Daniel.


EXT. NEW GAZEBO, BRICK PATH - AFTERNOON

The sun beats down on Jake, who’s laying brick. He looks up
as Camila walks toward the Main Resort. Jake jumps up.
                                                        43.


                    JAKE
          Hey! Camila!

She doesn’t stop. He starts to run after her, but sees Paul.
Shit. He goes back to work.


EXT. MAIN RESORT - VERANDA

Baby makes notes on a legal pad. Focused.

                    NOAH (O.S.)
          Look who’s still at Kellerman’s.
          And here I was thinking I would
          have to eat dinner alone.

Baby keeps writing. Smiles.


EXT. NEW GAZEBO - EARLY EVENING

The Crew pack up their tools. Jake stands. Fuck, he’s tired.


EXT. NATURE TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER

Jake heads toward his cabin. Sees: Baby. In the Old Gazebo.


INT. OLD GAZEBO

Baby sits in a chair, legal pad in her lap, full of notes.
She watches the late-day sun on the water. Jake trots up.

                    JAKE
          Hey. Thought you were leaving.


EXT. FLORES HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

A LARGE CABIN, situated far off the path, away from all the
other staff cabins. Jake KNOCKS on the door. Camila answers.

                    CAMILA
          Haven’t you done enough? Go away.

Carlos hobbles out the door.

                    JAKE
          Dude. They usually just let us go.
                                                           44.


                    CAMILA
          Of course, they let you go, you
          ignorant ass. They have different
          rules for you.

She goes back inside. Slams the door.

                    JAKE
          Wait, what?

                    CARLOS
          Nothing. She’s just mad.

                    JAKE
          If that dumb cop hadn’t driven by--

                    CARLOS
          Your friend’s going to help me.
          Frances. She said not to worry
          about it. But... Cami’s going to
          lose her shot at the scholarship.
              (re: his booted foot)
          It’s not twisted. It’s fractured.

                    JAKE
          Can’t she just dance by herself?

                    CARLOS
          No. It’s a partner dance.

                    JAKE
          Then find her another partner.

                    CARLOS
          I’d love to. I just want to fix
          this for her. I knew better than--

Wait. He scans Jake’s body. They’re about the same size.

                    CARLOS (CONT'D)
          You do it. You be her partner.

                    JAKE
          Right. She won’t even speak to me.

                    CARLOS
          She’ll have to if you’re her
          partner.

Fair point, and tempting. Jake thinks on it.

                    JAKE
          She’ll never go for it.
                                                         45.


                    CARLOS
          Leave that to me. You just be at
          the staff party tonight.

                    JAKE
          And what about, I’m not a dancer?

                    CARLOS
          Sure you are. It’s in your blood.


INT. DINING ROOM / RESTAURANT

Baby and Noah have dinner. Baby’s laughing.

                    BABY
          A wedding planner? You?

                    NOAH
          Whaddya think, I just hang out at
          event venues all summer? I’m
          arranging the Silverman wedding.

                    BABY
          The Silverman wedding? That’s big
          time. You must be pretty good.

                    NOAH
          I am really good. Because I happen
          to believe in love.

                    BABY
          You’re still young. You’ll grow out
          of it.


INT. CAMILA’S BEDROOM

On the walls: Photographs of old-school starlets: Rita
Moreno. Cyd Charisse. Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire.

There’s only one modern photo: JENNIFER LOPEZ as a FLY GIRL.

                    CAMILA
          I’d rather chew glass.

                    CARLOS
          Come on, Cami. His dad was a
          dancer. He’ll be a natural. And
          he’s exactly my size. He’ll fit
          into my outfit. He’s perfect.

                    CAMILA
          He is far from perfect.
                                                        46.


                     CARLOS
              (beat)
          Taking that car was dumb. It might
          ruin my life. I’ll never forgive
          myself if it ruins yours, too.

Camila sits on the bed. Stares at the starlets. Her dreams.


INT. REHEARSAL CABIN - SAME TIME

Jake’s found some old memorabilia. PHOTOS. Young people from
the 1950s. Poodle skirts and pompadours. Then from the 1960s.
Peddle-pushers and Keds. Until he comes to...

A PHOTO of a man in the center of a group of DANCERS. Tight
white T-shirt. Smoldering eyes. Johnny Castle, circa 1963.

Jake stares at the photo. He goes to the wall-length mirror,
mimics Johnny’s pose. Is it in his blood?


EXT. LAKESIDE CLEARING - THAT NIGHT

The Lighthouse BEACON sweeps over the water. String-lights
twinkle. Music plays. Staffers loiter and dance in the open
area. Jake mingles among the staffers.

He sees Carlos crutching his way toward him. But no Camila.

                    CARLOS
          She said no. Well, she said more
          than that, but the answer is no.

Jake’s disappointed, but kinda relieved. Then...

                    CAMILA (O.S.)
          Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.

                    CARLOS
          You’re here! I knew you would...

Camila walks up to them. Looks Jake up and down. She nods.
The crowd parts as she walks to the dancefloor.

                    JAKE
          Shouldn’t we practice or something?

                    CAMILA
          It’s now or never, Jake.

Someone changes the music. Jake straightens. He’s got this.
                                                          47.


He moves to join her. Camila pulls him close. For a moment,
they move together. They look good.

Then she proceeds to out-dance him so spectacularly that he’s
left standing still as she dances around him. Twirls, spins,
deft footwork. And everyone has stopped dancing to watch.

The music stops. Camila slinks back to him. Sexy. Dominant.

                    CAMILA (CONT'D)
          Is that enough attention for you?

She laughs. Jake doesn’t. Her eyes meet Carlos’s. He’s
disappointed in her. He limps away. Shit. To Jake:

                    CAMILA (CONT'D)
          I wish you’d never come here.

                    JAKE
          Yeah. Same.

He walks away.


INT. DINING ROOM / RESTAURANT

Baby and Noah are on the small dancefloor. It’s a simple
Salsa. Baby’s surefooted. Graceful. Then Noah changes it up.
He moves differently. Pulls her closer. Baby stiffens.

                    NOAH
          Forget the steps. Just follow me.

He moves in rhythm with the music. Baby tries to relax.

                    NOAH (CONT'D)
          That’s it. Let me lead you.

He pulls her even closer. For a second, she melts. Then she
steps back, gives herself a little space.

                    BABY
          Noah? I’m technically still
          married, you know.

                    NOAH
          Attorneys and your technicalities.

But he takes a proper stance. And they Salsa.


EXT. NATURE TRAIL

Jake catches up with Carlos.
                                                          48.


                    JAKE
          Whew, that was--

                    CARLOS
          I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Jake. I feel
          like I set you up for that.

                    JAKE
          Nah, it wasn’t that bad. Barely a
          flesh wound.

                    CARLOS
          It was a stupid idea. She can’t get
          an audition tape ready with a new
          partner. Not in ten days.

                    JAKE
          What’s in ten days?

                    CARLOS
          The Silverman wedding. Mrs.
          Silverman is on the board of Tisch.
          Cami wanted to give her the tape in
          person. But thanks anyway. For
          trying.

Jake stops. He’s looking at... the Rehearsal Cabin.


INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

Jake stands outside Baby’s room. He hesitates. Then knocks.


INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Baby and Jake sit by the window. Jake’s quiet. Finally:

                    JAKE
          So... when my dad taught you to
          dance, how long did that take?

                      BABY
          Well, I--

                    JAKE
          I mean, like a week? Ten days?

                    BABY
          What’s this about, Jake?

                    JAKE
              (long beat)
          I need you to teach me to dance.
                                                        49.


INT. REHEARSAL CABIN - NEXT MORNING

The RECORD PLAYER is set up. Baby puts an album on. Frankie
Valli & The Four Seasons: Big Girls Don’t Cry.

Her hair falls in casual, loose curls. She wears denim shorts
and a button-up shirt. She ties the bottom of her shirt,
unconsciously mimicking her look from that summer.

She looks around the cluttered room. Time to work. She starts
clearing the center of the room.


EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - AFTERNOON

Jake carries a BAG OF CEMENT on his shoulder. Baby walks by.
Gives him a thumbs-up. He smiles. It’s on!


EXT. VERANDA

Baby starts up the front steps. Noah’s at a table, poring
over a SEATING CHART. Baby detours. Heads his way.

                    BABY
          Look at you, hard at work.

He looks up. She looks vibrant. Carefree. Beautiful.

                    NOAH
          Wow. You look--

                    BABY
          Sorry. I’ve been moving boxes.

                    NOAH
          Don’t apologize. You look...wow.

                    BABY
              (flattered)
          So, I’ve still got some things to
          take care of today, but later...

                    NOAH
          Dinner?

                    BABY
          And maybe a dance. Or two.


INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Baby’s on the phone. She kicks off her shoes while she waits:
                                                          50.


                    BABY
          Frances Houseman. Yes. I’m
          representing Carlos Flores.
              (listens)
          This is my second message. I need
          to know what the official charges
          are going to be. Has he filed--
              (listens)
          Yes. Okay. You have my number.


INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM, BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

She turns on the shower. Catches sight of herself in the
mirror. YOUNG BABY looks back. No... she looks down at
herself, the hair, the shirt, the shorts. She looks back at
the mirror. It’s not YOUNG BABY. It’s her.


INT. FLORES HOUSE, KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

Baby, showered and changed, sits at the table with Julio,
Esme, Carlos, and Camila.

                    BABY
          They’re probably going to charge
          you with something called
          Joyriding. You’ll likely get a
          fine, and maybe a short probation,
          since it’s your first offense.

Esme slaps Carlos upside the head.

                    ESME
          ¿Ves lo que has hecho?

                      CARLOS
          Ow, Mamá.

Camila slaps him, too. He glares at her.

                    CARLOS (CONT'D)
          At least I’m not a quitter.

Camila fumes, stands up. Leaves the room. Carlos sighs,
miserable. Baby reaches across. Touches his hand.

                    BABY
          It’s going to be okay. All of it.


EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - EARLY EVENING

Julio, in a beige Kellerman’s work shirt, trims topiaries.
                                                        51.


INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Esme, in a beige Kellerman’s maid’s uniform, pushes a cart.


EXT. LAKE - SAME TIME

Guests paddleboard on the lake, ride in pedal boats, drift in
canoes. Music plays loudly from nearby...


EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION - SAME TIME

The 5:00 group dance class is winding down.

Camila says goodbye to the guests. Carlos sulks against the
railing. He perks up when he sees...

...Jake. Headed straight for them. Full of Castle swagger.
Now Camila sees him, too. Ugh. He walks right up to her.

                    JAKE
          You have ten days, right? All I’m
          asking for is a week. One week to
          learn the dance.

                    CAMILA
          You couldn’t learn the dance in one
          year. It’s too hard.

                    CARLOS
              (jumps in)
          But we could modify it. Yeah! You
          do all the flashy stuff.
              (pleading)
          Cami, this is your dream. It’s my
          dream for you. I know I screwed it
          up, but please, won’t you at least
          try? For me?

A long beat. Camila eyes them both. Shit.


EXT. KELLERMAN’S GARDEN - EVENING

A perfectly manicured English Garden, complete with benches,
topiaries, lighted cobblestone paths, and lots of roses.

                    BABY
          ...and the prosecutor’s on a
          fishing trip, so who knows when.
                                                          52.


                    NOAH
          Well, if you’re still here in two
          weeks, I could use a date for the
          wedding...?

Baby glances at him. She stops to smell a perfect rose.

                    BABY
          This garden wasn’t here before. I
          wonder when they put it in?

                       NOAH
          Last week.

                    BABY
          I mean, the whole thing.

                       NOAH
          Last week.

                    BABY
          Noah. These are mature trees. The
          rose bushes--

                    NOAH
          --were flown in from England. All
          of this was done last week. Ariel
          Silverman wanted it. So she got it.
              (grins)
          Told you I’m good at my job.

He picks the rose. Hands it to her.

                    NOAH (CONT'D)
          May I escort the lady to dinner?


EXT. MAIN RESORT - CONTINUOUS

Baby and Noah walk toward the Main Resort. Baby carries the
rose. She stops when she sees a CAR in front of the building.

She stares as Daniel hands his keys to the Valet.

                    BABY
          You’ve got to be kidding me.

                    NOAH
          Who is that?

                    BABY
          My husband.

Baby hurries away from Noah, toward the car.
                                                        53.


EXT. MAIN RESORT - CONTINUOUS

Baby reaches the car just as Lola and Lisa get out.

                    BABY
          Hey! The gang’s all here!
              (whispers fiercely)
          What are you doing here, Dan?

                    DANIEL
          Sounded like you might need help.

                    BABY
          I told you I could handle it.

Lola runs up to her mom. Wraps arms around her.

                    LOLA
          Did you miss me?

                    BABY
          Like crazy, my love.

Lisa lugs a suitcase from the trunk. The Valet takes it. Baby
glares at her. She’s part of this?

                    LISA
          It’s Kellerman’s. I had to.
              (looks around)
          Does it look smaller to you?
              (sees Noah)
          Oh. Well, hello handsome.

Noah walks past them. Gives Baby a long look. Glances at the
rose, still in her hand. Baby looks down at the rose. Shit.

Noah pulls his eyes from her and walks inside.

                    DANIEL
          Helping out a kid, huh? Is he
          legal, at least?


INT. BABY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A pair of linen pants lay across the bed. Baby takes off her
denim shorts. Looks up to see Daniel.

                    BABY
          Really?

                    DANIEL
          Oh, please, we’re married.
                                                           54.


                    BABY
          We’re separated.
              (mutters)
          I wonder why?

                    DANIEL
          Who was that guy downstairs?

She throws her denim shorts at him. He catches them.

                    DANIEL (CONT'D)
          He’s half your age, Fran--

                    BABY
          Jesus, Dan. I’m not screwing him,
          okay? He’s just a wedding planner,
          here for an event. Leave it alone.

Daniel considers that. He leaves the room.


INT. BABY'S HOTEL ROOM, LIVING ROOM AREA

Baby comes in dressed for dinner. She’s reverted to sleek,
refined Baby. Not the soft, casual Baby we just saw.

Daniel has her legal pad out, reading over her notes. She
snatches it away from him just as--

KNOCK KNOCK. She goes to the door. Lisa and Lola come in.

                       LISA
          Room keys!

She gives a key to Daniel.

                    LISA (CONT'D)
          Now, dinner. I’m starving.

                    BABY
          I thought maybe we’d go to town. We
          don’t need to have dinner here--

                    LISA
          No way. I’m celebrating my first
          night back at Kellerman’s, crappy
          food and all. Bring it on.


INT. MAIN RESORT BUILDING, DINING ROOM / RESTAURANT

Baby and her family are seated at a center table. Neil’s
stopped by the table to chat up Lisa.
                                                        55.


                    NEIL
              (to Lola)
          Your Aunt Lisa was the belle of the
          ball that summer. She really was.

His eyes gleam as they rove over Lisa. She flirts right back.

                    LISA
          You hush right now, Neil Kellerman.

Baby’s fidgety. Uncomfortable. Watching the door.

                    DANIEL
          Where’s that kid? Jake?

                    BABY
          In his cabin, I imagine.

                    DANIEL
          He’s still here, too?

Lisa shoots a look to Baby. Jake’s here, too?

                    NEIL
          Another Castle at Kellerman’s.
          How’s that for a hoot? Least he’s
          not a dancer, so he won’t be
          getting handsy with the guests--

                    BABY
          Excuse me. I need to go to the, um--

She stands. But just then... Noah walks in. His eyes meet
Baby’s. Shit. She hesitates between standing and sitting.

Lisa sees Noah. Oh!

                    LISA
          I’ll come with you.


INT. LADIES BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Baby comes in, Lisa hot on her tail.

                    LISA
          Who? What? When? Where? And how
          many times?

                    BABY
          For god sake’s Lisa.
                                                        56.


                    LISA
          This place is really good to you.
          First Johnny Castle, now that hunk
          of prime.

Nope. Baby turns around and walks right back out.


INT. MAIN RESORT BUILDING, DINING ROOM / RESTAURANT - LATER

Middle of dinner. Neil has pulled up a chair and made himself
at home. Baby picks at her food. Neil chats up Daniel.

                    NEIL
          And so the first thing I did was
          build a cigar room.

                    DANIEL
              (perks up)
          You have a cigar room?

                    LOLA
          Gross, Dad.

                    NEIL
          And the best Cognac you can get
          your hands on.

His voice fades as Baby sneaks glances at Noah, alone at a
nearby table. Picking at his own dinner.


INT. MAIN RESORT LOBBY - LATER

Daniel and Neil walk out of the Dining room.

                    NEIL
          Wait’ll you taste the Louis XIII.

Baby, Lisa, and Lola come out behind them. They peel off from
Neil and Daniel and head toward the elevators.


INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Baby looks at her watch. She’s going to be late.

                    LISA
          Let’s go see the lake. Oh! The
          cottages. What happened to the
          cottages? Are they still here?

                    BABY
          I can’t. You guys go ahead.
                                                          57.


                     LISA
          Why can’t you? You have plans or
          something?

Baby sighs. Dear. God.


INT. REHEARSAL CABIN - LATER THAT NIGHT

The room’s cleared, boxes shoved into all corners. Baby has
changed into athletic wear. She and Jake stand face to face.

                    BABY
          Um, they insisted. Is that okay?

Lisa and Lola wait, hopeful.

                    JAKE
          As long as you teach me to dance, I
          don’t care who’s watching.

                    BABY
          You two run the music, then.

Lola trots to the record player. Lisa pulls out albums.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          Something fast.

Lisa chooses an ALBUM. Baby pulls Jake to stand in front of
her. Sizes him up.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          First thing... frame.
              (pulls his arms up)
          This is your dance space.
              (lifts her own arms)
          This is my dance space.

Jake stands taller. Locks his ‘frame’. Lola puts the needle
down. Music PLAYS.

Baby’s talking low, we can’t quite hear her. She puts her
hand over his heart, her fingers tapping softly...

Lola watches, enraptured. Lisa leans down, whispers:

                    LISA
          You know what full-circle means?
                                                          58.


EXT. NATURE TRAIL

The little group say their goodnights. Jake walks toward his
cabin. Baby and Lisa turn to go. Lola watches Jake walk away.

                    LOLA
          Mom. He’s so... omigod.

                    LISA
          Honey, you should’ve seen his dad.

Baby smiles sweetly. So true.


INT. JAKE’S CABIN - LATER

Jake comes in. Stops in front of the mirror. He grabs the
photo of Johnny (with the dance group) from his nightstand.

He puts his hand over his heart. Two fingers tapping...

                    JAKE
          Ga-gung. Ga-gung.

                    BABY (V.O.)
          Don’t try so hard. Ga-gung...

Jake closes his eyes... and practices the steps.


INT. MAIN RESORT BUILDING, LOBBY

Baby, Lisa, and Lola come in.

                    BABY
          Why don’t you guys go on up? I need
          to see if the prosecutor called.

Lisa and Lola leave. Baby goes to the...


INT. FRONT DESK

                    BABY
          Do I have any messages from the
          courthouse?

                    CONCIERGE
          No, ma’am. But someone did leave
          this for you.

The Concierge gives her a small card and a ROSE, the same
kind of rose Noah gave her earlier. She pulls out the card.
                                                        59.


The front of the card says: For you. She smiles. Turns the
card over and it reads: Love, Dan.

Her smile drops.


INT. DANIEL’S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

He opens the door. Baby, rose in hand, walks inside.

                    BABY
          ‘Love, Dan’? Are you kidding me?

                    DANIEL
          What? I do love you.

                    BABY
          Jealousy doesn’t look good on you.

                    DANIEL
          So you’re saying I should be
          jealous.

                    BABY
          No, Counselor. I’m saying, go home.
          You have no reason to be here.

                    DANIEL
          Actually, Neil and I are golfing
          tomorrow. I like him.

                       BABY
          You would.

She turns. Leaves.


EXT. LUNCH PAVILION - AFTERNOON

Jake eats lunch with the crew. Carlos comes by. Plops down.
Grabs the bag of Jake’s chips. Jake tries to grab them back.

                    CARLOS
          No chips for you, you’re in
          training.


EXT. MAIN RESORT, FRONT

The Valet holds Baby’s car door open for her. She’s about to
get in when a HAND touches her shoulder. Noah.

                    BABY
          Hey. Listen. About last night...
                                                           60.


                    NOAH
          It’s your family. I get it.

                    BABY
          We’re getting divorced, Noah.

                    NOAH
          You don’t have to explain yourself
          to me. You don’t owe me anything.

Baby looks up at him. God, he’s sweet.

                    BABY
          You want to ride to town with me?

Noah’s surprised. Really? Baby misreads his hesitation.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          It was just an impulse. I know
          you’re busy. Anyway... okay.

She gets in the car.


INT. BABY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

She puts on her seatbelt. Sighs. And the passenger door
opens. Noah climbs in.

                    NOAH
          Always follow an impulse.


EXT. MAIN RESORT, LOBBY

Lisa and Lola step off the elevator. Neil walks past them,
gives them a WINK. He’s wearing GOLF TOGS.

                       NEIL
          Ladies.

Lisa smiles. Lola rolls her eyes. Ew.


EXT. HARDWARE STORE - SAUGERTIES, NY

Jake comes out with PAINT CANS. Loads them into a truck.


INT. WORK TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

Jake drives slowly down a provincial street. He sees Camila
walk into the SMALL PUBLIC LIBRARY. He stops the truck.
                                                        61.


INT. SAUGERTIES LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

Jake looks around. Where is she?


INT. TV/VIDEO ROOM

Jake walks into the DARKENED room. One TV is on. A B&W MOVIE
plays. Watching the movie: Camila. With headphones on.

He sits on the edge of the table. She pulls off the
headphones. Ugh.

                      CAMILA
            What are you doing here?

                      JAKE
            Why are you watching these old
            people? This isn’t how you dance.

                      CAMILA
            I love all dance. That’s why I
            wanted to go to Tisch.

                      JAKE
            Wanted? That’s the point, isn’t it?
            Of me learning to dance?

                      CAMILA
            The scholarship is dead. I know
            that. But I need for Carlos to
            forgive himself. So we’ll fake it
            for ten days, pretend to get along.
            We’ll make a shitty tape that I’ll
            never turn in, and then we’re done.

She turns off the TV. Walks toward the door.

                      CAMILA (CONT'D)
            Rehearsal’s at eight. And stop
            following me.


EXT. LAKE

Lisa and Lola are in a PEDAL BOAT. Lola pedals easily. Lisa’s
panting, exhausted, pedaling by rote as she tells her story:

                      LISA
            ...and it turned out, it wasn’t
            Johnny. He and Penny were just
            friends. It was Robbie!
                                                          62.


                    LOLA
          Asshole Robbie?

                    LISA
          Asshole Robbie! Do you know how
          humiliated I was? I could’ve died.

Damn, she’s tired. She stops pedaling, panting. Sweaty.

                    LISA (CONT'D)
          Why does anybody do this? God.
              (looks around)
          Where the hell are we?

She turns around. The shore is waaaaay back there.

                      LISA (CONT'D)
          Ah, shit.


EXT. MAIN STREET - SAUGERTIES, NY

Baby and Noah get out of her car.

                    NOAH
          Back here in thirty?

                    BABY
          Yep. See you soon.


INT. SAUGERTIES COURTHOUSE

Baby talks to a CLERK. He hands her a MANILA ENVELOPE. She
opens it. Pulls out a legal-looking form. We see CARLOS
FLORES, DEFENDENT printed at the top.

Baby’s eyes skim casually, unconcerned-- Wait WHAT??


INT. PROSECUTOR’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Baby argues with the PROSECUTOR’S CLERK.

                    CLERK
          I’m sorry, but he’s--

                    BABY
          Camping? Hiking? Fishing? Screwing
          a duck under his desk? What’s the
          reason I can’t talk to him today?

                    CLERK
          Excuse me, ma’am, but--
                                                          63.


                    BABY
          Tell him Frances Houseman is here.
          I’m the attorney for Carlos Flores
          and I want to speak with him. Now.

A door opens. LESTER SIMS (60s) comes out. Cold. Stern.

                    LESTER
          Right this way...

He goes back into his office. Baby follows.


INT. LESTER’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                    LESTER
          How can I help you today?

                    BABY
          Your prosecutor is charging my
          client with Grand Theft Auto.

                    LESTER
          I’m charging your client...

                    BABY
          You’re prosecuting this. Yourself?

                    LESTER
          It is my job.

                    BABY
          Fine. At best, the charge should be
          Joyriding. He’s a kid, with no
          priors. He didn’t steal the car
          with the intent to--

                    LESTER
          I don’t know what his intent was,
          Ms. Houseman, and neither do you.
          What I do know is that he stole a
          two hundred thousand dollar car.

Baby’s about to argue when he adds:

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          And had he not run it into a ditch,
          your young Mr. Flores could be in
          Mexico with it by now.

                    BABY
              (long beat)
          Mexico. I see.
                                                        64.


                    LESTER
          I’m glad you do. Please have your
          client here for his arraignment.
              (gives her a long look)
          Your best bet... is a guilty plea.


EXT. SAUGERTIES COURTHOUSE

Baby comes out. Furious. Noah’s waiting outside. He has a
couple of boutique shopping bags in his hand.

                    NOAH
          I got done early so I thought I’d,
          uh-oh. What happened?

                    BABY
          I need to get back. I can’t do
          lunch. I’m sorry.

                    NOAH
          No worries.

Baby nods her thanks. He takes her hand.

                    NOAH (CONT'D)
          Hold on. What’s going on?

                    BABY
          I just need to get back. Okay?


INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM, LIVING ROOM AREA

Baby fumes. Daniel, still in his golf togs, sits pensively.

                    BABY
          That racist, arrogant--

                    DANIEL
          He’s right, though.

                    BABY
          What? He is so wrong!

                    DANIEL
          Within the confines of the law,
          Frances, he’s right. They’re going
          to make the argument that Carlos
          would never have returned the car--

                    BABY
          Yes, he was going to return it!
                                                        65.


                    DANIEL
          But can you prove that?

                    BABY
          He had thirty-three dollars in his
          pocket, no bank account, and no
          credit cards to his name. He would
          have run out of gas before he
          reached the city.

                    DANIEL
          Or... he only had thirty-three
          dollars in his pocket, no money to
          open a bank account, and a two
          hundred thousand dollar stolen car--

She stops. Glares at him.

                    BABY
          I hate it when you’re logical.

                    DANIEL
          No, you don’t.

Their eyes meet. A spark. Heat. He stands up. Goes to her.

                    DANIEL (CONT'D)
          I love you like this.

                    BABY
          Nope.

                    DANIEL
          I do.

She considers it. Then pushes him away.

                    BABY
          Focus.

                     DANIEL
          Alright, then. What about the other
          boy? Jake.

                    BABY
          Nothing. They’re acting like he
          wasn’t even there.

                    DANIEL
          Didn’t he instigate it?

                    BABY
          I’m not throwing Jake under the
          bus. I’ll find another way.
                                                         66.


Daniel nods. His eyes linger on her lips. Baby wavers.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          You should go.

She pushes him toward the door... and out. She closes the
door. Whew. That was close. But now... she’s all keyed up.


INT. JAKE’S CABIN

He comes in after a shower. Wet hair. Low-slung lounge pants.
Shirtless. Towel around his neck.

                    CAMILA (O.S.)
          Jake. Is there any chance...

Jake turns. Camila’s standing in the open door. Her eyes
involuntarily lock on his naked skin. He pulls the towel from
his neck, stands straight, lets her look at him.

                    CAMILA (CONT'D)
          Um... any chance we can start at
          seven thirty instead of eight?

He smiles that sexy smile.

                    JAKE
          I’ll be there.


EXT. LISA’S HOTEL ROOM

Lisa and Lola are crashed out on the bed, in hotel robes.
Face down. Baby walks in.

                    BABY
          You guys ready-- what’s going on?

Lisa’s muffled voice comes from the bed:

                    LISA
          No dinner. Must rest.

                    BABY
          What the hell happened?

They both stir. Sit up. Sunburned faces. Lola looks tired,
but Lisa looks beat to hell.

                    LISA
          Pedal boats are the devil.
                                                        67.


                    LOLA
          We got stuck in the middle of the
          lake ‘cause Aunt Lisa didn’t want
          to pedal anymore.

                    LISA
          Do you know how big that lake is?

                    LOLA
          They had to come get us in a canoe.

They both plop back down. Baby smothers a laugh.


EXT. HOTEL CORRIDOR

Baby comes out of the room. Thinks.


EXT. ANOTHER HOTEL CORRIDOR

Baby knocks on a door. Noah answers. Surprised to see her.

                    BABY
          Wanna go dancing? Somewhere else.
          Away from here.


INT. BALLROOM

Jake walks in. Camila and Carlos are already there.

                    CAMILA
          We’ve reworked the dance so you’re
          doing a few basic moves, but mostly
          just standing there. Let’s start
          with your frame.

Jake walks up to her. Stands like Baby taught him.

                    CARLOS
          Look who came to play.


INT. SMALL DANCE CLUB - SAUGERTIES, NY - THAT NIGHT

A small venue filled with the town’s young people. Drinking,
smoking, dancing. In the middle of the kids: Baby and Noah.

Baby still holds herself apart from him. But she’s trying. A
little looser. A little more free.
                                                           68.


INT. BALLROOM

Jake and Camila are sweaty. Tired. Frustrated.

                    CARLOS
          Guys, look. This was just the first
          time. It’s going to be rough. But
          we can do this. I know we can.

Camila and Jake share a look. Fake it.

                    CAMILA
              (with false cheer)
          You’ve got this, Jake.

Jake shakes out his arms and legs. Carlos starts the music.
They try again. He can’t get the steps. Shit.

                    CAMILA (CONT'D)
          Watch me. One-two-turn-three...

She patiently shows him the sequence: one-two-turn-three...


MONTAGE - DAYS PASS

-- REHEARSAL CABIN: Jake watches Baby’s feet. They become...

-- BALLROOM: ...Camila’s feet -- a BLUR of precise motion.

-- FLORES HOME: Baby’s at the table with the whole family, a
   file and her legal pad in front of her.

-- JAKE’S CABIN: Jake practices in the mirror, his dad’s
   photo propped up, as if it’s watching him.

-- DANCE CLUB: Baby and Noah dance. She’s looser. More free.

-- GROUNDS: Paul hands out paychecks. Jake opens his. Smiles.

-- REHEARSAL CABIN: Jake’s feet move faster. He’s got it!
   Lisa and Lola applaud. He takes Baby’s hand. TWIRLS her
   out. She SPINS away...

-- BALLROOM: ...and Camila slinks sexily back to him. He
   swirls her around then PULLS her hard against his chest.
   He’s confident. Sexy as hell...


END MONTAGE - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

...as he looks down at Camila, pressed against his chest. She
pulls away. Flustered.
                                                           69.


                    CAMILA
          That’s, um, you’re a fast learner.

He goes to grab his water. Camila’s eyes lock on his every
move. She’s feeling it. God, he’s so... she turns away.

                    CARLOS
              (fans himself)
          Dios mio.


EXT. NATURE TRAIL - EARLY EVENING

Camila, Carlos, and Jake walk home. All tired. Jake peels off
at his cabin.

                    JAKE
          Same time tomorrow?

                    CAMILA
          Yep.

She and Carlos keep walking.

                    CARLOS
          You know, he’s getting really good.

She can’t argue that. She turns to watch Jake go into his
cabin. Carlos catches her looking.

                    CARLOS (CONT'D)
          I know, right?

                    CAMILA
          Zip it.


EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - DAY

The new gazebo is complete. The new brick walkway is
complete. All the new structures are nearing completion.


INT. MAIN RESORT, LOBBY - EARLY EVENING

Jake’s at the concierge desk. He slips his PAYCHECK into an
envelope. Seals it up.

A couple of guests come out of the Ballroom, followed by
Camila. Jake sees her. Smiles. She walks over to him.

                    CAMILA
          Fake Jake. What are you doing?
                                                          70.


                    JAKE
          Sending money to my mom.

                    CAMILA
          Wow. You’re a good son.

                    JAKE
          No. I’m really not.

The words surprise him. Camila watches the emotions cross his
face. Makes a decision:

                    CAMILA
          You wanna take a fake walk down by
          the fake lake?


EXT. LAKEFRONT DOCK - SUNDOWN

Jake and Camila stand on the dock. The Lighthouse Beacon
makes its journey. The beam washes over them, then moves on.

                    CAMILA
          You know, we may be faking those
          rehearsals--

                    JAKE
          I’m not faking it. I never was.

                     CAMILA
          I know. That’s why I may still have
          a shot at that scholarship.
              (beat)
          Why do you think you’re a bad son?

A long beat.

                     JAKE
          Before my dad died, he made me and
          my mom promise we’d be there for
          each other. That we’d stick
          together. I didn’t keep my promise.
              (beat)
          Neither did she. It was just too
          hard. I let him down.

The Lighthouse Beacon makes another sweep.

Camila reaches for Jake’s hand, but she pulls back just
before she touches him.

                    CAMILA
          Johnny Castle’s kind of a legend
          around here. To the staff, I mean.
                    (MORE)
                                                           71.

                    CAMILA (CONT'D)
          You must have inherited his talent.
          You’re learning crazy fast.

He likes being compared to his dad. He smiles. Then admits:

                    JAKE
          Well, okay. If I’m honest, I’ve had
          a lot of help. Frances has been
          teaching me, too.

                    CAMILA
          Frances, my brother’s attorney?

                    JAKE
          Yeah. My dad taught her one summer,
          in the ‘60s. Apparently, it was--

                    CAMILA
          Wait. No. Is Frances... Baby? As
          in, Baby and Johnny?


INT. SMALL DANCE CLUB - SAME TIME

Baby dances. She’s free. Having a great time. Noah dances up
behind her. She turns and together they’re fluid, intense,
hot. Noah is dying.

Baby’s into it, too. She runs her hand through his hair.

                    NOAH
              (whispers)
          Are we finally on a date?

Baby chuckles, pulls his face down to hers.

                    BABY
          Don’t get ahead of yourself.

Then she kisses him. And it is HOT. Then she pulls away.

                    NOAH
          Wait. Come back.

                    BABY
          Dancing. That’s why we’re here.

She dances away from him. Sexy. He pulls her back to him.


INT. REHEARSAL CABIN - LATER

Camila looks around. Excited to be there.
                                                        72.


                    CAMILA
          I’ve never been in here. I thought
          it was just storage.

She goes to the record player. Chooses an album. Something
old. Otis Redding on vinyl. She puts the needle down.

Music fills the room.

                    JAKE
          Frances said this is where my dad
          taught her. Now she’s teaching me.

That touches Camila. Deeply. She turns away. He
misunderstands.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          I’m sorry. I know Frances isn’t the
          only one teaching me. You are, too.

He reaches for her hand. God. She can’t take him being sweet.

                    CAMILA
          Don’t.

                    JAKE
          I just... what I was trying to say
          is, having her teach me, in here,
          is the closest thing to having my
          dad teach me. I wish he could have.
              (long beat)
          I never saw him dance. Not once.

He moves back. Bumps a box and jostles the 8MM VIDEO REELS.
They clatter to the floor. One rolls to his feet, spins for a
moment, then falls on its side. He picks it up.


MOMENTS LATER

Jake sets up the VIDEO PROJECTOR. He turns the lights out.
The only light now is the moon through the windows.

CU: RECORD PLAYER. Scratchy silence as the needle moves to
the next song. Another old, slow one: THESE ARMS OF MINE.

At the projector, Jake hits PLAY and on the wall: his dad
comes to life. It’s a reel of Johnny dancing. Jake stares.

                    CAMILA
          Now that guy can dance.

                    JAKE
          That’s him. That’s my dad.
                                                          73.


Camila looks at Jake. His eyes are glued to Johnny. Healthy.
Smiling. Dancing. Jake fights the emotion welling up in him.

And Camila weakens. She pulls him into her arms. They slow
dance under Johnny’s smiling eyes. Feeling everything.

The song ends. They stand like that, not moving. Then Camila
steps away. And leaves.

Jake watches her go. Turns to his dad. And Johnny dances.


EXT. MAIN RESORT, VERANDA - LATER THAT NIGHT

Daniel and Neil smoke cigars on the veranda. Chummy.

Baby’s car drives up to the Valet. Baby gets out. She’s
laughing. Flushed.

                    DANIEL
          There you are. I’ve been looking f--

The passenger door opens. Noah gets out. The men’s eyes meet.
Daniel calmly puts out his cigar. Goes inside.

Noah comes around the car. Tries to take Baby’s hand. She
subtly pulls away. Okay. He goes inside.

Finally, the Valet runs up. Takes Baby’s keys. Neil leans
over the veranda railing, puffs as Baby heads inside.

                    NEIL
              (smirks)
          Frances.

                    BABY
              (not having it)
          Neil.


INT. REHEARSAL CABIN - SAME TIME

Jake switches out the reel. More Johnny. More dancing.
Learning the part of his dad he never knew.


INT. DANIEL'S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Daniel answers the KNOCK on his door. Baby comes in.

                    BABY
          Where’s Lola?
                                                           74.


                    DANIEL
          Where she always is.

A SUITCASE is open on the bed. He’s packing.

                    BABY
          What are you doing?

                    DANIEL
          You said you wanted space and I
          didn’t listen. But I hear you now.
          I’ll have Tom expedite the divorce
          papers. You’ll have your space.

Baby watches him pack for a long moment. Then:

                    BABY
          Thanks. I appreciate that.

Daniel stares at her. Not at all what he expected her to say.

                    DANIEL
          Jesus Christ, Frances. What are you
          doing here? Do you even know?

                    BABY
          I’m helping Carlos Flores.

                    DANIEL
          No, you’re not. You’re going to
          plead him out because that’s all
          you can do. You’re here to relive
          some teenage summer-love fantasy.

He slams his suitcase shut. Heads to the door.

                    DANIEL (CONT'D)
          That boy, Noah? He’s playing with
          you, and you’re falling for it.
          There was a time when I would have
          been surprised by that. Tell Lola
          I’ll see her when she gets home.


INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM, LIVING ROOM AREA - MOMENTS LATER

Baby comes in. Hears laughter from the bedroom.


INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Lisa and Lola are on the bed, watching a movie. Beauty masks
on their faces. Bottles of nail polish strewn on the bed.
They carefully eat popcorn with freshly polished fingers.
                                                        75.


                    LOLA
          Movies and masks, Mom. Want one?

                    BABY
          I’ll skip the mask, but thanks.

She climbs onto the bed between them. Wraps her arms around
Lola. Lisa can tell something’s wrong. She wraps her arms
around both of them. Baby closes her eyes, accepts the love.


INT. BABY'S HOTEL ROOM, BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Baby opens her eyes. The TV flickers in the dark. She sits
up. Lisa and Lola are sound asleep on either side of her.


EXT. MAIN RESORT - MOMENTS LATER

Baby walks out on the big front porch. She looks out at the
Kellerman’s grounds, whispers:

                    BABY
          What am I doing here?

Then she sees someone. Down by the lake, standing in the NEW
GAZEBO. It’s all shadows and darkness, but... is that? Tall.
Broad shouldered. Tight white T-shirt. It looks exactly like:

Johnny.

She knows it can’t be him, but she walks...


EXT. FRONT LAWN

...across the lawn... down the slope... getting closer. It’s
not a figment. He’s there. He’s right there.


INT. NEW GAZEBO - CONTINUOUS

She walks quietly into the structure. Hesitant. In disbelief.

He’s at the railing, his back to her. She can’t be seeing
this. It’s not possible. Is it?

                      BABY
          H... hey.

He turns. It’s Jake, tears on his face. He wipes them away as
she joins him at the railing. She puts her hand over his.
                                                        76.


                    BABY (CONT'D)
          I miss him, too.

Jake takes a tiny step closer to her. With their shoulders
touching, they watch the water.


EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - NEXT MORNING

Jake walks to Paul, tired and bleary-eyed, but ready to work.

                    PAUL
          You getting any sleep? You’re on
          the roof today. Get going.

Jake gives him a thumbs-up. Heads to work.

                    PAUL (CONT'D)
              (calls)
          Hey. You’re doing good work, kid.

Jake can’t fight a smile.


INT. SAUGERTIES COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON

Baby waits outside the JUDGE’S CHAMBERS.


INT. JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - A LITTLE LATER

The JUDGE sits behind her desk, a file open in front of her.
Carlos’s MUG SHOT stares out.

                    JUDGE
          You can’t argue discrimination when
          the kid actually took the car.
          Plead no contest and I’ll try to
          work with you on the sentencing.

                    BABY
          My client is going to start his
          adult life with a felony, just
          because some racist prick wants to
          make an example of him?

                     JUDGE
          Because he stole a car. And as much
          I agree with you that they’re
          overcharging the case, Mr. Stanton
          is within his rights here. And the
          D.A.’s backing him up.
              (beat)
          The arraignment’s in a week.
                     (MORE)
                                                           77.

                    JUDGE (CONT'D)
          I suggest you break the news to
          your client. He’s going to have a
          record.


EXT. JAKE’S CABIN - SAME TIME

Jake still in his work shirt, sits on his stoop. Beside him,
an envelope and his paycheck.

He has a NOTEPAD on his lap. He stares at the paper. Thinks.

Then he starts to write. CU on notepad: Dear Mom. Let me
start by saying I’m sorry. I made Dad a promise...


EXT. OUTSIDE EATING AREA

Lisa and Baby have salads. Baby stabs at hers.

                    BABY
          ...so they’re going forward.

                    LISA
          With Grand Theft? That’s a felony.

                    BABY
          Yep. The judge wants to help, but
          her hands are tied.

Lola walks up. Plops into a chair.

                    LOLA
          Just got off the phone with Dad.
          Sounds like he’s going to stop
          trying to win you back.

                    BABY
              (long beat)
          Are you okay with that? You know we
          will always love you and be there
          for you. Both of us. But--

                    LOLA
          Mom, I’ll be honest.

Lola glances at Lisa.

                    LISA
          It’s okay. Tell her.

Baby looks between them. What’s going on?
                                                           78.


                    LOLA
          I love you, okay?

She puts her hand over Baby’s. Very teenage-adult.

                    LOLA (CONT'D)
          At home, you were wearing green
          shirts and throwing parties and
          being all perfect-y. That’s Aunt
          Lisa, that’s not you. Here, you’re
          different. You’re kind of... wild.
          Dad may not love that. But I do.

Baby squeezes Lola’s hand. She grabs Lisa’s. Lola takes
Lisa’s hand. The Houseman girls. Baby smiles.

THWUMP THWUMP THWUMP. They all look up as a HELICOPTER flies
overhead... and LANDS on the front lawn. Lola gawks.

Neil hurries by them, flustered. Nervous. He speed-walks
toward the chopper. Baby laughs at his frantic pace.

                    NOAH (O.S.)
          Theeeey’re heeere.

Baby looks up to see Noah, standing by their table.

                    NOAH (CONT'D)
          Hello, ladies. Would you like to
          meet the Silvermans?

The chopper powers down as two WOMEN emerge. ISABEL SILVERMAN
(50s) and her daughter ARIEL (20s). Regal as queens.

                    LISA
          Now that’s an entrance.

                    LOLA
          Mom, let’s go meet them.

                    BABY
          Uh, no. I left my tiara at home.

Lisa jumps up. Takes Lola’s hand.

                     LISA
          I’ll go.

                    NOAH
          That’s the spirit.
              (to Baby)
          See you later?

Baby watches a line of expensive cars wind up the driveway.
                                                          79.


                    BABY
          The Silvermans are here. Every last
          one of them.


EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - LATER THAT DAY

People are BUSY. Neil is out front, like a conductor.

                    NEIL
          Let’s go, people. We have three
          days to get this done.


INT. MAIN RESORT, LOBBY - NEXT DAY

Jake’s on a ladder. He holds a long GARLAND made of FRESH
WHITE ROSES against the wall. The DECORATOR eyes it.


INT. BALLROOM - SAME TIME

A MINI-ORCHESTRA is set up in the back corner. Strings,
woodwinds, brass, percussion -- they have it all.

Camila and Carlos walk in as a dozen or so EXQUISITE
BALLERINAS walk out. Like swans. Long and sleek.

                       CARLOS
          Holy shit.

                    CAMILA
          I know. It’s gonna be beautiful.

She watches the women leaves, her eyes full of admiration.
They’re living the life she wants. Professional dancers.

She shakes it off as Ariel and her groom TEDDY (20s) enter.
Camila turns all sweet, polite business. Very professional.

                    CAMILA (CONT'D)
          I’m Camila. I’ll be teaching you
          your dance. You’ve chosen the
          Mambo. One of my favorites.


EXT. NEW GAZEBO - EARLY EVENING

Jake attaches a last sheath of WHITE ROSES to the gazebo. He
steps back to look at it. It’s beautiful.
                                                           80.


INT. BALLROOM - AFTERNOON

Camila dances with Ariel. She leads Ariel into a turn. Looks
to Teddy. Carlos stops the music.

                    CAMILA
          Like that, Teddy. She’ll follow you
          if you lead her. Wanna try again?

Teddy takes Ariel into his arms. Carlos starts the music.


EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - EVENING

Noah is in his element. Directing workers and decorators.
Baby watches from the veranda. He glances up at her. Smiles.


EXT. REHEARSAL CABIN - NIGHT

Jake hurries into the cabin, dressed to dance.


INT. BALLROOM - NEXT MORNING

NOTE: WE ARE NOW THREE DAYS BEFORE THE WEDDING. TWO DAYS
BEFORE THE ARRAIGNMENT.

Baby hurries in. A TRIPOD and VIDEO CAMERA are set up.

                    BABY
          I know I’m late. It’s a madhouse
          out there-- oh, hey. What’s this?

Everyone’s there: Jake, Camila, Carlos, Lisa, Lola.

Jake and Camila are in sexy DANCE COSTUMES.

Camila and Carlos stare at Baby. Barely contained glee on
their faces.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          What’s going on?

                    LISA
          The cat’s out of the bag.

                    BABY
          Oh! You found out I was helping.
          Well, I wanted to--

                    CAMILA
          We didn’t know you were Baby.
                                                         81.


Baby blinks. She’s confused until:

                    LISA
          The cat’s out of the bag... Baby.

Camila and Carlos are both grinning at Baby. Baby finally
realizes... oh. She blushes, waves them away.

                    BABY
          Okay, alright.
              (to Jake and Camila)
          You guys look... Is today the day?

                    JAKE
          Yep. And since we-- I-- couldn’t
          have done this without you...

                    CAMILA
          We wanted to know if you’d be the
          one to tape us. Lend us some luck.

Baby’s touched. She grabs both their hands.

                    BABY
          I’d be honored. Let’s do it.

Camila grabs Jake’s hand. Lola starts the music. The dance
begins. But we don’t see the dance.

We stay on Baby - behind the video camera. She watches
Carlos. His happy, innocent face.

She turns her attention to the camera. Filming.


INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM, LIVING ROOM AREA - THAT NIGHT

Baby and Lisa sit on the sofa, drinking wine. Lola’s at the
window, staring out at the Lakeside Clearing in the distance.
The lights. The dancing. The fun.

                    LOLA
          Can’t we go down there? Please?

                    BABY
          They don’t want guests down there.

                    LOLA
          But we’re not guests, we’re us.

                    BABY
          I’m sorry, honey. Not tonight.

Lola huffs. Goes in to the bedroom. We hear the TV come on.
                                                        82.


                    BABY (CONT'D)
          The arraignment’s in two days.
          Carlos is expecting a Joyriding
          charge, because I--

                    LISA
          You haven’t told him yet?

Baby shakes her head. Lisa winces. Yikes.

                    LISA (CONT'D)
          Baby, you have to tell him.

                    BABY
          I just thought I could figure a way
          around it, because it’s so
          goddamned unfair. But I can’t.


EXT. LAKESIDE CLEARING - SAME TIME

The Lighthouse Beacon washes over Jake and Camila as they
dance. And now, they’re the couple everyone watches. Jake’s
good. Really good. He and Camila move together like water.

They are a unit. Heat radiates from them.

Carlos hangs by the railing, a huge grin on his face.


INT. BABY'S HOTEL ROOM, BEDROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT

Baby’s sitting up in bed, one hand on Lola, who has curled
into her, asleep. But Baby can’t sleep. She’s too worried.


EXT. LAKESIDE DOCK - SAME TIME

Jake and Camila walk along the dock. She stops to lean
against the railing. The Lighthouse Beacon washes over her
face, then moves on. Jake’s mesmerized. She catches his look.

                     CAMILA
          Stop it.

                    JAKE
          You’re beautiful.

                    CAMILA
          I mean it. Stop.

                    JAKE
          Fine. I’ll stop saying it. But I
          won’t stop seeing it.
                                                           83.


                    CAMILA
          Jake, I’m... I’ve been focused my
          whole life. On dancing, on this
          scholarship, on my future. I don’t
          do anything lightly. I don’t... do
          casual. Ever.

The Lighthouse Beacon sweeps slowly over them again.

                    JAKE
          I’ve been a fuck up pretty much
          since my dad died. I didn’t take
          anything seriously. But Camila,
          there’s nothing casual about the
          way I feel when I’m with you.

She turns to him. So close. His eyes close as her fingers
trace his cheek, his lips. She pulls his head down.

The Beacon washes them in soft light as their lips meet.

It’s THE KISS. Passionate, perfect. He picks her up. Her legs
wrap around his waist. They lose themselves in each other.


EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Baby roams. Restless.


EXT. NATURE TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER

Baby walks. Deep in thought.


INT. OLD GAZEBO - CONTINUOUS

Baby walks past the old gazebo. Doesn’t even see it.


EXT. LITTLE BRIDGE

She walks across the bridge and...


EXT. STONE STEPS

...where she doesn’t even look up until she gets to...


EXT. JOHNNY’S OLD CABIN

Jake’s cabin now. Baby stops. How did she end up here?
                                                           84.


A dim lamp shines inside. She hears talking. Laughter. Jake
and Camila. Good for them. She turns, ready to head back...

...and sees a LIGHT is on in the Rehearsal Cabin. Huh.


INT. REHEARSAL CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

Baby comes up the stairs. No one’s there, of course. She
reaches for the light switch. Turns it OFF.

A BEAM OF MOONLIGHT shines through the window, right onto:

The VIDEO PROJECTOR. It still has a reel on it. Curious, Baby
walks over, presses PLAY. The wall lights up and Baby gasps.

On the wall: Johnny dances. Baby sinks to sit on the floor.

Her eyes linger on him, remembering everything. She watches
him dance. Young. Beautiful. Happy.

                    BABY
          What would you think of me now?

Johnny SPINS SPINS SPINS...

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          You believed I could change the
          world. But I didn’t do it, Johnny.

She fights tears...

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          And I’m trying. I’m trying to get
          back to the me you loved. The me I
          loved. But I don’t even know if I
          can. I don’t know what it feels
          like to... win anymore.

She lets out a harsh laugh through the tears.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          Wouldn’t you know it? All this
          walking and worrying tonight and
          somehow I made my way to you. You
          were always there when I needed
          you. I’m sorry I wasn’t--

...and then she finally lets herself cry.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          I would have been there. You know
          that, right? Please know that.
                                                          85.


STRONG ARMS come around her from behind. Johnny’s arms.

She knows they’re not real, but she FEELS them. And we SEE
them. She puts her arms around his, clutches them tightly.

A long beat. Then she opens her eyes. His arms are no longer
there. She’s hugging herself. She stands. Walks to the image
of Johnny. She kisses her fingers. Touches them to his face.

She walks out of the room, leaves Johnny dancing behind her.


INT. JAKE’S CABIN

Jake lies with Camila in his arms. He’s never been so happy.


EXT. MAIN RESORT, FRONT

A few cars are lined up in the front drive. Several MEN (20s)
stagger toward the lobby doors, corralled by Noah.

He sees Baby walking toward him.

                    BABY
          You’re out late.

                    NOAH
          A wedding planner’s job is never
          done. Meet the groom. Teddy Pope.

Teddy holds out a gallant, but unsteady hand to Baby.

                    TEDDY
              (mumbles drunkly)
          Pleasure to meet you, miss.

Noah gives Teddy’s car keys to the Valet. The other men
shuffle toward the doors. They go inside.

                    NOAH
          I’d say let’s get a drink, but--

                    BABY
          You have your hands full.

Noah gives her a quick kiss on the cheek. Then, boldly, a
soft, sweet kiss on her lips. He smiles. Leads Teddy inside.

Baby touches her mouth. What the hell is she doing?
                                                        86.


INT. FLORES HOUSE, KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING

Esme leads Baby to the table. Camila, Jake, Carlos, and Julio
are having breakfast. They’re happy, laughing.

                    ESME
          Look who’s here. Frances, will you
          join us?

She shakes her head. Jake, Camila, and Carlos share a look.

                    CARLOS
          Something’s wrong. What is it?


INT. CAMILA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Camila SLAMS into her room. Grabs her DANCE BAG from the
floor. DUMPS it. Shit scatters: dance shoes, binders, the
Silverman photos, and... the VIDEO TAPE. She grabs it.


EXT. FLORES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Camila flies out the front door. She runs down the...


EXT. NATURE TRAIL

...toward the lake. Jake runs after her.

                    JAKE
          Camila! Cami, wait!

She just runs faster. In a desperate fury.


EXT. LAKEFRONT DOCK

She gets to the railing and--

                    JAKE
          Camila, don’t!

--she SLINGS the tape into the lake. It hits with a PLUNK. It
floats for a second, then... sinks.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?

                    CAMILA
          It’s over. Those were stupid
          dreams. This is reality.
                    (MORE)
                                                        87.

                    CAMILA (CONT'D)
          How the hell am I supposed to go
          off to dance school while he’s in
          jail for something he didn’t do?

She starts to cry. Jake reaches out for her. She jerks away.

                    JAKE
          I’m sorry, Cami.

Then she grabs him. Clutches him. He pulls her close.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          I know how to fix this.


INT. FLORES HOUSE, KITCHEN

Camila comes in. She’s been crying.

                    CARLOS
          Cami. Listen, I’ll be okay--

                    CAMILA
          Jake’s going to the police station.
          He’s going to tell them it was his
          fault. That he was driving.


INT. JAKE’S CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

Jake tucks his wallet into his back pocket. Baby comes in.

                    BABY
          What do you think you’re doing?

                    JAKE
          The right thing.

                    BABY
          You going to jail instead of Carlos
          doesn’t fix anything.

                    JAKE
          I won’t go to jail. We all know why
          they’re doing this to Carlos. They
          won’t do it to me. They never do.
          And even if they did, so what? I’m
          nothing. I got nothing. I’m going
          nowhere. It doesn’t matter.

Baby stares at Jake. It’s like a gut punch to her.
                                                        88.


             BABY                       JOHNNY (V.O.)
People treat me like I’m        People treat me like I’m
nothing because I’m nothing.    nothing because I’m nothing.

                    JAKE
          What?

                    BABY
          Johnny said that to me. He was
          standing where you’re standing
          right now. And he was scared.
          Scared that he was never going to
          be anything, or do anything
          important with his life. But
          Jake... he did.

Jake sits on the bed. What is she talking about?

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          Johnny gave up dancing for you.
          Willingly. Happily. He wanted to
          give you a good life, a stable
          life, the kind of life he never
          had. You were everything to him.
          You are not nothing, Jake Castle.
          You are your father’s son.

Jake looks at the photo of Johnny. His dad’s face. And starts
to cry. Baby wraps him in her arms.


EXT. FLORES CABIN - LATER

Jake and Baby walk back to Camila’s. Camila comes onto the
porch. She looks to Baby, who nods. It’s okay.

Camila runs down the steps, into Jake’s arms.


EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - EARLY NEXT EVENING

Paul’s handing out paychecks. Jake takes his with a grin.


EXT. OLD GAZEBO - SUNDOWN

Camila and Carlos sit on the rail. Jake stands behind them.
They all watch the sunset. Quiet. Until...

                    CARLOS
          I’m sorry, Cami. Your scholarship--
                                                        89.


                    CAMILA
          Forget it. I couldn’t dance now if
          I wanted to. Not when you’re...

She reaches for his hand. Carlos trembles.

                    CARLOS
          I’m scared.

                    CAMILA
          I know. Me, too.

Jake puts his arms around them both. As the sun sinks behind
the watery horizon... the Lighthouse Beacon comes on.


INT. JAKE’S CABIN - NEXT MORNING

Jake’s in the best clothes he has there. Pressed shirt and
jeans. He combs his hair. He looks nice.


INT. FLORES HOUSE, CAMILA'S BEDROOM

Camila smoothes her dress. Pulls her hair into a sleek pony.


INT. FLORES HOUSE, KITCHEN

Esme straightens a TIE on Carlos’s neck. Julio holds Carlos’s
jacket. They fight tears.

                    CARLOS
          Mamá--

And she breaks. Julio hugs his family.


EXT. MAIN RESORT, FRONT

Baby, Lisa, and Lola come out. They’re dressed for court.
Nice, but not too nice. She’s nervous.

Noah hurries out.

                    NOAH
          Frances!
              (she turns)
          Good luck today, Counselor.

                    BABY
          There’s nothing good about today--
                                                        90.


A pair of KEYS whizzes past her head. She ducks just in time.
The Valet catches them, trots toward an idling SPORTS CAR.

                    GROOMSMAN
          Take it easy with her.

He heads inside. As he passes Baby:

                    GROOMSMAN (CONT'D)
          Sorry about that.

                    BABY
          No, it’s... fine.

Suddenly, she smiles. Confident. Sure. She kisses Noah hard
on the mouth. He grins.

                    NOAH
          What was that for?

                    BABY
              (to Lisa and Lola)
          Everybody in the car. Let’s go.


INT. SAUGERTIES COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM

Lisa and Lola have found seats with Jake, Camila, Esme, and
Julio. Baby’s at the front with Carlos.

                    JUDGE
          Carlos Flores is charged with one
          count of Grand Theft Auto. How does
          he plead?

Carlos starts to stand. Terrified. Baby stands with him, puts
a hand on his shoulder:

                    BABY
          Your Honor, I would like to move to
          dismiss all charges.

She turns to smile at Lester Sims, the D.A. and his dickhead
client, Mr. Stanton.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          Mr. Flores did not steal Mr.
          Stanton’s car. It’s stated in the
          police report that Mr. Stanton
          tossed his keys to Mr. Flores and
          told him to “Take it easy with
          her,” which suggests he wanted
          Carlos to take the car for a drive.
                                                           91.


Lester stands. Oh, hell no. But Baby continues.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          Mr. Stanton may argue that he
          thought Carlos was the valet.
          However, that argument has no
          merit, considering he’d met my
          client earlier that day and was
          informed that Carlos was not the
          valet. Therefore, one can only
          surmise that Mr. Stanton intended
          for Mr. Flores to take his car for
          a drive. A joyride, if you will.

The Judge smirks. She’s loving this.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          The only thing Carlos Flores is
          guilty of is perhaps not taking it
          “easy” enough.

                    LESTER
          Your Honor, this is ridiculous--

                    JUDGE
          I’ll decide what’s ridiculous,
          Counselor. Charges dismissed.

She brings the GAVEL down.

                    JUDGE (CONT'D)
          And I suggest you park your own car
          from now on, Mr. Stanton.

Baby grins. She WON!


EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - THAT EVENING

He trots down the hill, toward the Lakeside Clearing.

The sun goes down and THWEEP. All the LANDSCAPE LIGHTING
comes ON for the night. Jake stops to take it in. Wow.

He turns toward the lake to see: THE NEW GAZEBO.

Well-built. Fully decorated. All lit up. Beautiful.

And Jake realizes... he helped do that.
                                                           92.


EXT. LAKESIDE CLEARING - THAT NIGHT

Staff hang-out. Jake has fully taken Carlos’s place. He and
Camila burn up the dance area.

Carlos dances as well as he can, in his boot.

Baby, Noah, Lisa, and Lola make their way into the area. Noah
watches Jake and Camila. They are amazing.

                    NOAH
          That’s what you’ve been doing every
          night? And you never invited me?

She laughs. The song ends. Jake sees them.

                    JAKE
          Hey, look who’s here!

Baby takes it all in. It’s the same, but different. Lola is
in heaven. Finally, they’re at the party!

                    BABY
          We’re crashing. I hope that’s okay.

                     CAMILA
          Are you kidding? Dancing with Baby?
          Hell yeah!

Lisa runs to the guy playing the music. Makes a request.

Suddenly: PUSH IT by Salt-N-Peppa plays. She yells to Baby:

                    LISA
          It’s your jam! Oo, Baby Baby...

She pulls Baby onto the dance area. Lisa can’t dance at all,
but she has a great time.

But Baby is killing it. Noah moves to dance with her.

Lola stares. Jake hands her a SODA.

                    JAKE
          Your mom’s pretty special.

                    LOLA
          You know, this should be a thousand
          times embarrassing, but... that’s
          my MOM!

Baby dances up to Lola, who goes to dance with her mom.
                                                           93.


Camila whispers to a staffer, who whispers to another
staffer, and on and on. Pretty soon, they’re all watching
Baby dance.

Lola hugs Baby. Baby melts. Jake, Camila, and Carlos join
them on the floor. All dancing. All laughing. All happy.


INT. JAKE’S CABIN - THAT NIGHT

Camila pushes Jake down on the bed. Pulls his shirt off.


INT. NOAH’S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

Baby shoves Noah against the wall. She is HUNGRY, and she’s
making a meal of Noah. He’s totally fine with that.

She unbuttons his shirt. Runs her hands over his muscled
chest. Oh my GOD. His body, his skin. So firm. Suddenly:

                    BABY
          Do you know how much older I am
          than you?

Noah pulls back enough to see her face. He stares down at
her. Intense. Sincere.

                    NOAH
          Old enough to teach me everything I
          need to know.

He picks her up, hands on her ass, and carries her to the
bed. She pulls him down on top of her.


INT. LISA’S HOTEL ROOM

Lisa and Lola have raided the mini-bar.

Their loot sits between them on the bed: chips, candy bars,
cookies, nuts. Lola bites into a candy bar. She smirks.

                    LOLA
          What do you think they’re doing?

Lola smirks. Lisa throws a potato chip at her.

                    LISA
          Don’t you ever let your mother know
          everything we talk about. She’ll
          kill me. And you.
                                                        94.


INT. JAKE’S CABIN - EARLY NEXT MORNING

Camila wakes up. Stretches. Snuggles closer to Jake.

                    CAMILA
          That was some night.

Jake pulls her close.

                    JAKE
          Yeah, it was.

                    CAMILA
          I’m so happy for Carlos. Frances
          really is incredible.

                    JAKE
          Yeah, she is.

                    CAMILA
          Is that all you got this morning?

                    JAKE
          Yeah, it is.

                    CAMILA
              (laughs)
          Too bad we have to work today. Come
          on, I’m hungry.

She sits up. Tugs at his shoulders. Get up.


EXT. NATURE TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER

Jake and Camila walk toward her house. Her eyes keep glancing
toward the lake... and the dock... where she threw the tape.

                    JAKE
          We can make another tape.

                    CAMILA
          There’s no time. We’re working all
          weekend.

                    JAKE
          Then we’ll dance at the wedding.
          They have to have entertainment,
          right? A live audition’s better
          than a tape, anyway.
                                                           95.


                    CAMILA
              (laughs)
          They brought in the American Ballet
          Company and The Three Tenors. They
          don’t want to see me do the Samba.

She shrugs. Tears her eyes away from the lake, keeps walking.
Jake follows behind her. Thinking.


INT. NOAH’S HOTEL ROOM - NEXT MORNING

Noah’s in front of the mirror, towel around his waist. Baby
watches from the bed, the covers wrapped around her.

                    BABY
          You are something to look at.

Her eyes trail down his body. He turns.

                    NOAH
          Stop looking at me like that. I’ve
          got a wedding to run. Today’s the
          big day. I can’t be late.

She smiles at him. Plucks at the sheet around her chest.

                    NOAH (CONT'D)
          Well, maybe I can be a little late.


EXT. MAIN RESORT, FRONT LAWN - A LITTLE LATER

Jake stands in the middle of a flurry of last minute
activity. He’s looking for... there he is.

Noah directs a couple of guys draping flowers.

                    JAKE
          Noah. You have a couple of seconds?

                    NOAH
          Kinda busy, but what’s up?

                    NEIL (CONT'D)
          If you see something that needs
          doing, do it. Be swift. Be
          courteous. Be quiet.


EXT. KELLERMAN'S GROUNDS - MID MORNING

The resort has been transformed into a fairytale of flowers
and lights. Walls and arches of ROSES lead to the...


EXT. NEW GAZEBO

...where chairs are set for the ceremony. It’s magical.


EXT. OUTDOOR DANCEFLOOR

A MINI-ORCHESTRA is set up under a tent. The tent is draped
in FRESH FLOWERS and VINES.

A dancefloor is under its own tent -- with hanging roses and
elaborate chandeliers. Arranged nearby:


EXT. RECEPTION AREA

Long tables are set under gauzy tents. Delicate lights dangle
above. The tables are adorned in romantic loveliness.

HELICOPTERS hover outside the boundaries of the property.
Paparazzi eager for shots of the million dollar affair.

                                                        97.


                    BABY
          We’re not crashing. We’re Noah’s
          guests.

                    LOLA
          I can’t wait to see it!


EXT. CEREMONY AREA

A STRINGED QUARTET plays elegantly.

Baby, Lisa, and Lola sit in the back row. Lisa looks around,
trying to see who’s there. She slaps Baby’s arm.

                    LISA
          Omigod, that’s the Governor.

                     BABY
          Lisa.

Suddenly, the WEDDING MARCH starts. Everyone stands. TWELVE
FLOWER GIRLS walk down the newly-laid brick path. Followed by
Ariel. A fairytale vision of bridal beauty. And wealth.

                     LISA AND LOLA
          Whoa.

                    NEIL
          We’re in the big leagues now.


INT. RECEPTION AREA

Guests listen politely as the Three Tenors perform. Isabel
Silverman sits near the stage. High-class perfection.


INT. BEHIND THE STAGE AREA

Jake paces. Carlos chuckles.

                    CARLOS
          It’s gonna be great. I can feel it.

Camila walks up. Quietly:

                    CAMILA
          What are you guys doing back here?

                    JAKE
          Nothing. Listening.

The Tenors finish their set. The guests clap politely.

Camila sees the ballerinas make their way to the stage.

                    CAMILA
          Oh, here they come. Look at them.

Jake and Carlos share a look.


INT. RECEPTION AREA - A LITTLE LATER

The ballerinas finish their performance.

The guests clap politely as they bow. Isabel Silverman gives
a nod of approval. Well done.

The EMCEE walks to the stage. Takes the mic.

                    EMCEE
          Thank you, everyone. It’s been a...

Noah hurries onto the stage. A NOTECARD in his hand.
                                                           99.


                       EMCEE (CONT'D)
          Hold on.


INT. BEHIND THE STAGE AREA

Jake tenses. Carlos grabs his arm.

                    CARLOS
          Oh, shit man. He’s doing it!


INT. RECEPTION STAGE

The Emcee looks down at the notecard.

                    EMCEE
          We have one more performance. This
          one is specially... for the mother
          of the bride. Isabel Silverman.

Isabel perks up. Really? Noah hurries up to her. Sits down.

                    NOAH
          You’re going to love this, Isabel.

                    EMCEE
          Please welcome Kellerman’s own
          Camila Flores and Jake Castle.
          Performing... the Samba.


EXT. NEIL’S TABLE

Baby, Lola, and Lisa share sharp looks.

                       BABY
          What?

                    LOLA
          Omigod what?

Neil glares at the stage.

                    NEIL
          What?! No. The Governor is here.

He stands up, like he’s going to stop it. Lisa takes his
hand. She’s as surprised as they are, but:

                    LISA
          Cool your jets, Neil. He’s a
          Castle. It’ll be great.
                                                       100.


INT. BEHIND THE STAGE AREA

Jake hurries to take Camila’s hand. She’s in shock.

                    CAMILA
          What’s-- what is this?

                    JAKE
          Your audition. Come on.

She pulls back. No way.

                    CAMILA
          I’m not performing after the
          American Ballet!

                    JAKE
          I knew you’d say that. It’s why we
          didn’t tell you.

                       CAMILA
          Who’s we?

Carlos walks by with a BOOM BOX, makes his way to the stage.

                    CARLOS
          Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me.


INT. RECEPTION STAGE - CONTINUOUS

Carlos limps onto the stage and smiles to the orchestra.

He puts the Boom Box on a stool near the microphone stand.
Smiles again. And looks for Jake and Camila.


WITH JAKE AND CAMILA

Jake takes Camila’s hand. Kisses her knuckles.

                    JAKE
          It’s now or never, Cami. Let’s see
          what you’ve got.

He leaves her standing there and walks...


INT. RECEPTION STAGE

...onto the stage. He nods at Carlos to start the music.
Carlos presses PLAY on the Boom Box. Fast Latin music flows.
                                                         101.


Jake stands tall. Perfect frame. Hold his arms out, in
position. He sees Camila glance at Isabel.

Camila shakes her head: No. Jake nods. YES.

Everyone waits. It’s getting a little awkward when finally...

Camila SPINS onto the stage and into Jake’s arms.

Jake takes her hand, TWIRLS her. She SPINS under his arm as
they go into the Samba. It’s fast. Their feet like lightning.

Camila is electric. And Jake is her partner.


WITH BABY

Baby, Lisa, and Lola stand for a better view.

                      BABY
            Look at him go.

                      LISA
            We did a good job, didn’t we?

Baby laughs. Yes, “they” did.


INT. RECEPTION STAGE

Near the stage, Isabel is rapt. Jake pulls Camila close.

                      JAKE
            She’s loving it. You know I can’t
            keep up with you, so show her what
            you can really do.

He TWIRLS her out... and leaves her on the dancefloor. Camila
watches him go. Did he just...?

                       JAKE (CONT'D)
            Dance.

And Camila DANCES. Guests stare. Amazed. Enraptured.


WITH ISABEL

Isabel can’t make herself look away. Noah grins.


EXT. SCULLERY TENT

Carlos stands with Esme and Julio. Carlos whispers:
                                                       102.


                      CARLOS
            Go, Cami. Go.


WITH JAKE

Jake looks on. So in love. As Camila dances, she catches his
eye, holds out her hand...


INT. RECEPTION STAGE - CONTINUOUS

...and Jake jumps back into the dance for the big finish.
SPIN, SPIN, SPIN, SPIN... and DIP.

The music stops. Camila’s cradled in Jake’s arms.

                      JAKE
            Now that is how you steal the show.

He gives her a gentle, sweet kiss.

The guests STAND. The applause is overwhelming. Camila looks
at Isabel. Noah leans to whisper something in Isabel’s ear.

Isabel looks again at Camila, with new eyes. Then... she
smiles. She nods and stands to applaud with the other guests.

With a regal tilt of her head, Isabel calls them to her.


WITH ISABEL

Camila nervously approaches Isabel, Jake right behind her.

                      ISABEL
            Noah tells me that you’re
            interested in going to Tisch,
            Camila.

                      CAMILA
            It’s... it’s always been my dream.

                      ISABEL
            I’m pretty sure we can make that
            happen.

Camila tries not to scream. Isabel smiles. Looks to Jake.

                      ISABEL (CONT'D)
            You know, young man, there aren’t
            enough male dancers in the world.
            We’re always looking...
                                                          103.


She gives him a smile and walks away.

                    CAMILA
          Jake. Do you think that means...

Jake swings Camila around. Kisses her. Then grabs the mic.

                    JAKE
          Everybody dance!


EXT. OUTSIDE DANCEFLOOR - LATER

The reception has moved onto the dancefloor, under the moon
and stars and lights of Kellerman’s.

POP MUSIC plays.

Everybody gets down. Ariel and Teddy. Esme and Julio. Lisa
and Lola. Carlos and Isabel. Baby and Noah.

Over the water, the sun sinks lower...


EXT. KELLERMAN'S GROUNDS - LATER

...and the party rages on. And we see... THE LIGHTHOUSE
BEACON. It shines... moves on... shines...


EXT. LAKESIDE DOCK

...on Jake and Camila as the music from the party drifts down
and they slow dance together on the dock.

                    CAMILA
          Are you going to think about it?
          Tisch? Dancing? Maybe?

He holds her close as the Beacon washes over them.

                    JAKE
          I don’t know. Just a few weeks ago
          I thought I was had nothing. Now, I
          feel like I can do anything.

                    CAMILA
          You can do anything.

                    JAKE
          I know what I do want...

The light moves off them. She raises on tiptoes to KISS him.
The Beacon shines on them again as he picks her up.
                                                          104.


EXT. OUTSIDE DANCEFLOOR

Baby and Noah dance. He nuzzles her hair. He sees Ariel
beckoning to him. Sighs.

                    NOAH
          I’ve got to get back to work now,
          But this thing we’ve got going, can
          I see you? When I’m in the city? Or
          was this just a summer fling?

                    BABY
          I don’t know yet.

He grins. He’ll take it. He kisses her. Walks away.

Lisa and Lola run up to Baby.

                    LOLA
          Omigod, Mom, this is the best
          summer I’ve ever had.

Tears fill Baby’s eyes as she looks at Lisa, who’s also
teary. All their memories of Kellerman’s, come full-circle.

                    LISA
          It’s this damned place, isn’t it?

                    BABY
          No. It’s us.

She takes their hands. The Houseman Girls.

And then... the opening beats of PUSH IT by Salt-N-Peppa
booms over the loudspeaker.

                    BABY (CONT'D)
          It’s our jam!

Suddenly, Jake and Camila rush onto the dancefloor, Carlos
close behind. Everyone. Together.

They gather in the middle of the dancefloor, all singing
along to:

                    EVERYONE
          Oo, Baby Baby...

The music swells and we:

                                                FADE OUT.
