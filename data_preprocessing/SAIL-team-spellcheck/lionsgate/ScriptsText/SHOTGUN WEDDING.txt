FADE IN:


EXT. PRIVATE ISLAND. PHILIPPINES - NIGHT

We see a festive tiki torch-lit cocktail party from afar.       *

We’re on the dark docks across the island where a big sign
reads: “Amanpulo Island Resort.”

A SHADOWY FIGURE sneaks onto the docks and kneels beside a
covered boat. He unties the tarp and slides it off like a
dress, revealing a gorgeous 1973 Riva Aquarama speedboat.

The mystery man unzips a duffel bag and gets to work.


INT. GUARD’S STATION - NIGHT                                    *

A Filipino SECURITY GUARD sees movement on one of the boats.    *

He gulps and his eyes flick to a bulletin board of WANTED
posters of known pirates... printed in five languages and
stamped with the logo of the Philippine Navy.


EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

The Guard creeps along the dark dock, Beretta M9 in hand.

               (in Filipino)
           Freeze!

The FIGURE on the back of the boat panics, stumbles back and
falls overboard with a SPLASH!

The Guard runs to switch on a FLOODLIGHT and sees:

The vintage speedboat is now decked out with white streamers
and wood letters spelling “Just Married.”

                     SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
               (laughing his ass off)
           I almost shoot you! I thought you                    *
           were pirate! But you’re just a guy.                  *

TOM FOWLER, a charmingly neurotic Midwestern baseball player,   *
pulls himself onto the dock in his soaking wet suit.            *

                     TOM                                        *
           Yep, just a guy.                                     *

Tom grabs a towel from the dock and dries himself off.          *

                    SECURITY GUARD
          Aww, this is for your bride?                          *

                    TOM
          Yeah, it’s a surprise. What do you                    *
          think?                                                *

                       SECURITY GUARD                           *
          It’s nice!                                            *

                    TOM                                         *
          You think? Are the decorations too                    *
          corny-- or corny in a fun way? I                      *
          mean, it is our wedding, might as                     *
          well go all out, right? I want it                     *
          feel festive and romantic-- but not                   *
          cheesy or generic, y’know?                            *

                     SECURITY GUARD                             *
              (same tone)                                       *
          It’s nice!                                            *

Tom checks his phone and sees the time: 8:13. Shit.             *

                    TOM                                         *
          I have to go.


INT. BEACH - NIGHT                                              *

CLOSE ON a phone screen with an unsent text that reads: “Tom,   *
where are you??” The text is stuck in SENDING mode.             *

WIDEN TO REVEAL the phone is in an outstretched hand,           *
reaching as high as it can go, trying to get service. The       *
hand belongs to our bride GRACE RIVERA, confident, dynamic,     *
and currently stressed the hell out.                            *

She checks the status of the text: Unsent.                      *

                       GRACE                                    *
          Damn it.                                              *

Grace takes a deep breath to center herself and then flips      *
around, walking up the sand toward:                             *


EXT. POOLSIDE COCKTAIL PARTY - CONTINUOUS                       *

A wedding welcome party in full swing. From Grace’s POV, each   *
guest waves and smiles at her. She’s the star of the night.     *

ON GRACE as she scans the crowd, looking for Tom. She greets    *
people as she passes. She hates this, but she’s good at it.     *

                    GRACE                                      *
          Gloria, hi! Welcome!                                 *
              (then, waving)                                   *
          Uncle Benny! You made it!                            *
              (waving)                                         *
          Peter! Looking sharp.                                *
              (squints, not remembering                        *
               someone’s name)                                 *
          Youuuu, sir! Hello!                                  *

RENEE ORTIZ (Grace’s mother, impossibly glamorous and highly   *
critical) hooks arms with Grace, pulling her toward the bar.   *

                    RENEE                                      *
          Where have you been?                                 *

                    GRACE                                      *
          I was taking a moment, Mom. Is that                  *
          allowed?                                             *

                    RENEE                                      *
          Not at your wedding, no. I need you                  *
          to talk to your father’s                             *
          girlfriend.                                          *

          Wife.                                                *

                    RENEE
          --Whatever. She keeps smiling at
          me. Can you tell her to stop                         *
          smiling at me?

                    GRACE                                      *
          Sure. I’ll tell Dad’s wife to stop                   *
          smiling at you. That won’t cause
          any issues.

They land at the bar and Renee drops her empty martini glass   *
as the bartender immediately passes her a full one.            *

                    RENEE                                      *
              (to bartender)                                   *
          Thank you, Jerome.                                   *
              (then, to Grace)                                 *
          So where’s the groomzilla?                           *

                    GRACE                                      *
          Tom is not a groomzilla.                             *

                    RENEE
          Well, I saw him in a manic state                     *
          arranging flowers an hour ago.                       *

          You know if you took your dad’s                       *
          money for this wedding, you could                     *
          have paid someone to do that.                         *

                    GRACE                                       *
          We wanted to pay for it ourselves                     *
          so this wedding could be about us                     *
          and what we wanted.                                   *

          Those were Tom’s idea and... I love                   *
          them. They are perfect.                               *

          for tomorrow yet? Because I can’t

EXT. JUNGLE PATH - NIGHT

Tom in a SPEEDING GOLF CART as he changes into dry clothes.
We see a farmer’s tan and a blurry old Detroit Tigers tattoo.

          It’s your “something borrowed”!                       *
          Everyone in our family uses them on                   *
          their wedding day. They bring good                    *
          luck. Except for poor Uncle Greg                      *
          who was indicted for check fraud.                     *
          But that’s not the knives’ fault!                     *

ROBERT RIVERA (Grace’s dad, an impressive, charming man in a    *
designer suit) approaches. He kisses Grace on both cheeks.      *

                    ROBERT                                      *

          Carol! Lovely to see you!                             *

He then pivots to see Renee, who backs away one step.            *

          It’s wonderful you two are still                       *
          friends. Our neighbors Darlene and                     *
          Phil divorced and it tore up our                       *
          book club. Can’t imagine if they                       *
          were stuck on an island together.                      *

Carol laughs. Everyone else smiles. Grace is in hell.            *

HARRIETT (40s, bohemian chic, spends lots of time to look        *
effortless) floats up, handing a cocktail to Robert.             *

                    CAROL (CONT'D)                               *
          Oh, you must be Robert’s wife.                         *

Harriett kisses Robert for way too long before responding.       *

                    HARRIETT                                     *

          Gracie...                                              *

Harriett holds Grace in an intimate hug she did not want.        *

                    HARRIETT (CONT'D)                            *

          I am so honored to be here and bare                    *
          witness to this sacred observance                      *

Harriett breaks out of the hug and warmly smiles at Renee.       *

Renee tries to hurry away alone but Carol catches up. Larry     *
wanders off, filming the crowd.                                 *

The RESORT GOLF CART SPEEDS OVER and Tom jumps out before it
stops. He’s now under-dressed in a corduroy sport coat.

Grace sees him, and he smiles at her. He still has the power    *
to knock her off her feet, even at her most annoyed. He         *
steals two wine glasses and joins his fiancée.                  *

                     TOM
          There’s my beautiful bride. This is                   *
          for youuu.

Grace takes both the glasses of wine from Tom. He stiffens up   *
when he sees Robert and extends his hand for a handshake.       *

          Tom, you are glowing. The energy                      *

Grace holds up her drinks and shakes her head no. Robert        *
walks off with Harriett.                                        *

them. He’s one of those friends you have to constantly
apologize for. Sometimes to police officers.

          I’m working on my best man speech
          and I can’t remember the name of
          that girl you dated at Spring
          Training who called your dick
          “Short Stop”--

                    TOM
          You don’t need to mention that...                      *
          Maybe give me a copy of your speech                    *
          and I can do a quick edit.                             *

                    RICKY
          Tom, you gotta relax. Pro-tip? Make                    *
          love BEFORE the wedding. Takes the                     *
          pressure off. I should know.                           *

                    TOM
          You got divorced twice.

                    RICKY
          Yeah but the weddings were great.                      *
          Speaking of, any women here single?                    *

          No.                                                    *

          Damn it.                                               *

Suddenly, they hear a DEAFENING NOISE as a ISLAND HOPPER         *
HELICOPTER coming in for landing.

It blows napkins and hats away. Makes waves in the pool.
Everyone watches with fascination as it touches down and out
of the cockpit hops SEAN HAWKINS in a billowing khaki shirt.

                    JAMIE
          You invited Sean? Wow, did he get                   *
          hotter since you dumped him? He                     *
          looks like he’s leading a porn
          safari.

Grace rushes over to Tom, who is downing his drink.           *

                    GRACE                                     *
          I didn’t think he’d actually come.                  *
          He never RSVP’d!                                    *

                    TOM                                       *
          Which was a very cool move. Excited                 *
          to finally meet him. Oops, I guess                  *
          he was in a rush and forgot to
          button his shirt all the way up.

ANGLE ON Sean as he kisses Harriett’s cheek, then bear-hugs   *
Robert. They lock in a deep embrace.                          *

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          Why is he hugging your dad? Wow,
          they’re, like, really hugging. Did
          your dad just smell his neck?                       *

          After we broke up they just kinda                   *
          became friends? Sean stays with my                  *
          dad when he’s in New York. They                     *
          FaceTime a lot. It’s weird.                         *

                    TOM                                       *
          Awesome, love that for them.                        *

Grace and Tom approach Sean. He swoops Grace in his arms,     *
picking her up effortlessly and spinning her around.          *

                    SEAN
          Gracie... Hi. Sorry I didn’t RSVP.                  *
          I never know where I’m going to be
          month to month. I was in Tokyo last                 *
          minute closing a deal and there was                 *
          a mix-up with the jet guy I use in                  *
          Japan-- it’s a whole boring thing.                  *

          It’s okay. Glad you could make it.                  *
          It’s been--

                    SEAN
          A long time. But wow. You look the                  *
          same. More stunning even. I didn’t                  *

Sean looks deeply into Grace’s eyes.                           *

                    TOM
          So how long do the spinn-y things

          Actually Tom’s season ended and his                  *
          contract hasn’t been renewed yet.                    *
          So technically, he’s unemployed.                     *

          That’s right, sir. Thank you for                     *
          clarifying.                                          *

Tom downs the rest of his drink in one gulp.                   *

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Guests sit down for a rehearsal dinner set up on the beach.    *
Grace stands, holding a microphone.                            *

                    GRACE                                      *
          Thank you all for coming. I know it                  *
          was a long trip. We really wanted                    *
          to pick a place that was convenient
          for none of you.                                     *

People laugh, seated at long tables under twinkly lights.      *

          But I spend too much time talking                    *
          at work, so I’m going to hand it                     *
          over to my fiancé Tom.                               *

Tom pulls out notecards and cues up a SLIDESHOW behind them:   *

IMAGES of Tom in his baseball uniform with Grace in a fancy    *
suit. Different worlds but they seem so happy and carefree.    *

Tom starts getting flustered. He skips to his next notecard.    *

                    GRACE                                       *

          Grace always talked about her time                    *
          in the Peace Corps in Bali. And I                     *
          thought, how cool would it be to                      *
          get married there? But turns out                      *
          Bali is un-Bali-vably expensive.                      *

uncertain whether his speech is over. Grace grabs the mic.       *

          some medical supplies to a village

          she can do all the work.

          This boat was a beast. I was
          worried. Turns out I was right to                      *
          be, because the first time our girl

          I’ll bring tissues tomorrow.                        *

Everyone laughs and sighs admiringly, except for Tom. He’s    *
pissed. The third wheel at his own wedding.                   *

                    SEAN (CONT'D)

          Bercinta kakekmu...                                 *

Sean winks. Grace laughs. Everyone raises their glasses and   *
drinks except for Tom because his is empty.                   *

                    TOM

          Oh god. It’s hard to explain.                       *
          It means: “I’m going to enter your                  *
          grandpa with my body.”

                    TOM

INT. TOM AND GRACE’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT                           *

Grace stands in front of the bathroom mirror, in pajamas,       *
putting moisturizer on her face.

                    TOM (O.S.)
          Ricky said we should have sex
          before the wedding. I was like,
          “Yeah right! We’re only half way
          through the seating chart!”

She stops, looks at the mirror, and makes a decision. Fluffs
her hair. Adjusts her t-shirt so it hangs down low.             *

She steps out a little seductively...                           *

                     GRACE                                      *
          Hey baby, whatcha doin?                               *

Tom sits on the bed amid seating name cards, mason jars, and    *
piles of ribbon, holding a hot glue gun. He looks possessed.    *

              (talking to the ribbon)
          You do not want to be glued, do
          you, you little bastard?                             *
              (to Grace, not looking up)                       *
          I know tonight didn’t go great, but
          tomorrow will be perfect. Just need                  *
          to finish these centerpieces and                     *
          rearrange the seating chart now                      *
          that Sean is-- FUCK!                                 *

Tom pulls his hand away from the glue gun.

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          I burned myself with the glue gun.                   *
          It’s fine. Wait, no it’s not.                        *

Tom violently tries to shake the ribbon off his hand.

                    GRACE                                      *
          Hey Tom? Maybe we should have sex.

                    TOM
          Really? Okay. I just have to finish                  *
          these centerpieces.

          Okay, but do you really?

Tom looks up to see... Grace seductively taking off her        *
pajama bottoms to reveal basic cotton underwear underneath.

                    TOM
          Oh no. Come on. I love you in a t-
          shirt and no pants.

          Are you kidding? The Donald Duck?                    *
          It’s so hot. But seriously, I just
          need to finish these--

                    GRACE                                      *
          Then I need to reach for this book.                  *

Grace tries reaching for a book on a shelf but is too short.   *

                    TOM
          Ohhh man. Why is it so sexy how you                  *
          can’t reach high shelves?                            *

          this one.                                              *

          Come here.                                             *

Tom kisses her and they fall back onto the bed. They share a     *
tender moment staring into each other’s eyes.

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          Hi. Haven’t done this in a while.                      *

and his eyes lands on one: SEAN HAWKINS.                         *

INT. TOM’S PARENTS’ BUNGALOW - NIGHT

Tom lies on a sleeper-sofa listening to his parents’ SNORING.
He peeks over the couch at his parents, who are still
spooning in their jammies after all these years. It’s
everything he wants, but right now he’s about to marry a
woman he’s never felt farther away from.


EXT. AMANPULO ISLAND - DAY

The next morning, MUSIC PLAYS as we tour Amanpulo from above
and finally get why Tom picked it: a gorgeous green firework
of an island surrounded by turquoise ocean.

The Northern coast is sheer red cliffs topped with green
jungle, speckled with guest bungalows...

The Southern coast is the main resort complex: a thatched
roof lobby connected to a dining cabana. Marge directs her       *
staff to set up decorations and lights. And Ace sets up          *
fireworks by the pool.                                           *

At the docks, the Security Guard from last night watches all     *
the bustling staff. He shakes his head and laughs.               *

Then he sees a FISHING JALOPY pulling up to the docks...


EXT. DOCKS - DAY

The BOATMAN is a chain-smoking local in sunglasses and a ball
cap. He unloads a HUGE CRATE onto the dock and offers a
clipboard for the Security Guard to sign.

                     SECURITY GUARD
              (in Filipino)
          What’s in this one? A damn ice
          sculpture?
                          Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)          22.


The Boatman smiles and offers a pen. The Guard reads the        *
delivery slip but doesn’t see a 2ND FIGURE climb up out of      *
the water right behind him. It’s a dripping wet pirate          *
wearing a skull-print balaclava.                                *

                       SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
             Americans are crazy. One time I                    *
             went to Disneyworld and saw a bride                *
             and groom getting married by the                   *
             rat from Ratatouille!                              *

The Boatman gives a slight NOD to the skull-masked pirate.      *

BAM! The Pirate shoots the Guard in the back of the head.       *

HOLY FUCKING SHIT.                                              *
He pops the lid off the huge crate and the two men pull the     *
Guard inside. Then latch it and shove it off the dock.          *

The crate bubbles and disappears under the water. It took       *
seconds. The workers on the beach have no idea.

The killers hop back onto their boat and swing open the door
to the cabin. Sunlight pours in and illuminates:

Eight pirates around a table. All their faces are masked with
different balaclavas: a DOG, a SKULL, a CLOWN, a SHARK, a       *
RAT, a TIGER, a GHOST and a LIZARD.                             *

The Boatman puts on a BLACK BALACLAVA. He’s the LEADER.         *

He opens a laptop and pulls up a website. A wedding website:    *

“Graciela Rivera and Tom Fowler Say I Do ”                      *

INT. TOM AND GRACE’S BUNGALOW - DAY                             *

The bungalow is now a full bride zone. Renee drinks a mimosa.   *
Grace sits in front of a vanity, in her dress, as Carol         *
hairsprays her hair. Like, so much hairspray.                   *

On the vanity, a bridal magazine sits open to a page with a     *
soft, romantic bridal updo.                                     *
                    Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)              23.


                    CAROL                                      *
          Ta-da! What do we think?                             *

As the cloud of hairspray clears, we get a full view Grace’s   *
updo, with a dramatic hair fall. It’s kind of like the         *
picture, but on steroids.                                      *

                    RENEE                                      *
          The good news is: If you fall down,                  *
          your hair will act as a helmet.                      *

                     CAROL                                     *

          Thank you.                                           *

Jamie enters the hut, hungover. She catches sight of Grace.    *

                    JAMIE
          Whoa, your hair...                                   *
              (off Grace’s glare)                              *
          ...is super fun!                                     *

                    GRACE                                      *
              (to Jamie, pointed)                              *
          Can you help me button my dress?                     *

Jamie follows Grace into the bathroom and she buttons the      *
bodice of her dress. They whisper to each other.               *

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                             *
          Where have you been? You were                        *
          supposed to do my hair and now                       *
          birds are going to lay eggs in it.                   *

                    JAMIE
          Sorry, I overslept. I kind of, sort                  *
          of had sex with Ricky last night.                    *

                    GRACE                                      *
          Ricky?

                    JAMIE
          Ugh. I know. I was just tipsy and                    *
          feeling myself, and he’s dumb in a                   *
          refreshing way. It’s embarrassing.                   *
          I’ll avoid him today, and then I’ll                  *
          never have to see him again.                         *

                    GRACE                                      *
          He’s Tom’s best friend.                              *

                    JAMIE                                      *
          But how long are you going to stay
          married? Two years tops, right?

Grace glares at her.                                            *

                    JAMIE (CONT'D)                              *
          I’m joking! It’s a joke!                              *
              (then, to everyone)                               *
          Okay. She’s ready!                                    *

Grace walks over to a full-length mirror where we see her       *
whole look. THE DRESS is a too-tight corset bodice with a       *
layered tulle skirt. Everyone smiles. Grace looks miserable.    *

                    GRACE                                       *
          Something isn’t right...                              *

ON GRACE, deep in thought, as her family futzes with her.       *

INT. TOM’S PARENTS’ BUNGALOW - DAY

Tom ties his bowtie in the mirror as Larry films it. Ricky      *
pours a stoic Robert some whiskey. Ricky jumps in front of      *
Larry, directly addressing the camera.                          *

                    RICKY                                       *
          It’s Tom’s big day! Time to get                       *
          this party started. Let’s go around                   *
          and trade stories about Tommy.                        *

                    TOM                                         *
          We don’t need to--                                    *

          Last year, on the road, I walked in                   *
          on Tom jerking off to a bridal
          magazine.                                             *

Ricky laughs uproariously. No one else does.                    *

                    TOM                                         *
          It was a picture in a wedding
          magazine and the Wifi was out. So.

          Would you care for a bagel, sir? Or                   *

          No, thank you.                                        *

          Dude, why do you use a deeper voice                   *
          when you’re talking to Robert?                        *

                      TOM                                       *
          I do not.                                             *

Robert gets up from his chair.                                  *

                    TOM (CONT'D)                                *
              (notably deep voice)                              *
          Need something, Robert?                               *

          Just going to the bathroom...                         *

A text pops up on Tom’s phone from Grace: “We need to talk”.    *
His face drops. This isn’t good.                                *

                    RICKY                                       *
          Larry, Tom’s being boring, come                       *
          film me doing a backflip.                             *

Ace is putting the finishing touches on the reception space.    *
Elaborate table settings. Mason jar candles. Flowers.           *

On the beach, guests are gathering at the ceremony site. He     *
spots Sean regaling guests with a great story. Fuck that guy.   *

He hurries along and bumps right into Harriett heading down a   *
path to the beach. She greets Tom with a warm embrace.          *

                    HARRIETT                                    *
          Tom! The man of the moment! You                       *
          look very centered, very handsome.                    *

                    TOM
          Thank you. I wasn’t sure about the                    *
          white jacket. I didn’t want people
          to think I was trying to look like
          James Bond.

          Don’t worry. You don’t look like                      *

Course and Nature Walk.                                        *


EXT. NATURE WALKWAY - DAY

Tom walks on the elevated wooden walkway, looking like he’s    *
walking to his execution. He sees Grace in a hotel robe over   *
her dress. Even with his nerves, he’s stunned by her beauty.   *

                    TOM
          Wow, you look beautiful...                           *
              (then, bracing)                                  *
          So, you wanted to talk?                              *

                    GRACE                                      *
          I know it’s last minute, I just...                   *
          needed to see you once before                        *
          walking down the aisle.                              *

Tom laughs. Leans against the railing. Delirious. Nauseous.    *

                    TOM
          I thought you were calling it off.

                    GRACE                                      *

          I don’t know. This weekend hasn’t                    *
          exactly gone to plan. We’ve fought                   *
          more in the past few months than in                  *
          our whole relationship. I thought a                  *
          wedding was supposed to be fun.                      *

          It was morning in Manila! I just                     *
          wanted everything to be perfect for                  *
          our wedding. I wish you cared even                   *

          decorations and making playlists,                    *

Two Pirates sweep into the kitchen with shotguns aimed.        *
COOKS, in the middle of prep, put their hands up, terrified.

          Won’t happen again.

Grace tugs her engagement ring off, throws it at him. Tom’s      *
baseball reflexes kick in, and he catches it with one hand.

They are both briefly impressed by that catch, then Grace        *
heads off down the path, furious. Tom calls out:

          Great! Go tell your parents it’s                       *

different trails. Surrounding the beach. Getting in position.    *

Tom leans on a railing, in disbelief about how everything
went so wrong, when Marge pulls up in her golf cart.

                    MARGE
          There you are! We were about to                        *
          send out a search party.                               *

She pins a boutonniere of tropical flowers to his lapel.

                    TOM
          I don’t need that.

                    MARGE
          You do. The waiters are wearing                        *
          white jackets. People will be
          confused.

                     TOM
          I don’t need it because it’s not
          happening.

Tom shows her the engagement ring in his hand. Glinting in
the sun. Marge is shocked. She watches Tom walk off alone.

Suddenly she SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER.

                    LARRY (CONT'D)
          I think you might be overreacting.

She’s looking over her husband’s shoulder at Pirates spilling   *
out of the jungle. Guns aimed.                                  *

                    PIRATE LEADER                               *
          Hands up! No one gets hurt!                           *

The guests scream as they’re corralled like cattle. One         *
guest, a middle-aged MAN, tries to make a run for it.           *

BANG! A pirate SHOOTS the man, grazing his arm. He YELPS.       *


EXT. NATURE WALKWAY - DAY                                       *

Tom startles at the ECHOING GUNSHOT coming from the beach. He   *
looks toward the beach but his view is obstructed by trees.     *

He cautiously climbs three rungs of a ladder to the ZIPLINE     *
PLATFORM. He gets dizzy, terrified by how high he is.           *

But then he sees it: all of the guests surrounded by pirates    *
with guns. Suddenly every petty resentment in Tom’s brain       *
vanishes... replaced with one primal mission:

                     TOM                                        *

EXT. POOL - DAY                                                  *

The wedding guests are marched into the swimming pool in
their fancy clothes by masked pirates at gunpoint.               *

The resort workers are marched elsewhere, held separately.       *

Everyone is shaking with fear and shock. Larry helps Carol       *
down the steps into the pool.                                    *

Jamie instinctively holds her phone above the water as she
steps into the pool. A pirate with a snarling pitbull on his     *
balaclava (DOG-FACE) aims his gun at her.                        *

                    DOG-FACE                                     *
          Ay! Hands down!                                        *

          I mean, I really can’t breathe. I’m
          wearing shapewear. Get me out of
          this dress. Now. Now.

                    TOM

Tom looks at the back of the dress, sees twenty tiny pearl
buttons. He starts trying to undo buttons as fast as he can.

                    TOM
          How are there so many buttons?                       *

          No you’re not!

Tom’s frantic eyes land on the hook-latch on the door.

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          If the door’s latched from the
          inside, he’ll know we’re in here.

Tom runs into the bathroom and cranks the SHOWER on.

scans the room with his machine gun. No one here.                *

                    TOM
          Here’s the plan: He thinks we’re in
          the shower, moves to open the
          bathroom door... I jump out and get
          him in the net.

          What about this?

Grace grabs a can of aerosol hairspray from the vanity.         *

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                              *
          I’ll spray him in the eyes!

                    TOM
          How is hairspray in the eyes better
          than a net over his head?                             *

OUTSIDE

Dog-Face (and his sunglasses!) peeks underneath bungalows for   *
hiding spots. Tom and Grace are seconds from being found.       *

INSIDE

Tom snatches a hotel matchbook from the night stand and they
WHISPER-ARGUE RAPID-FIRE:

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          Light a match, then spray the
          hairspray... Flamethrower!

          It won’t work. It’s too many steps.

                    TOM
          It’s two steps! It’ll surprise him,
          then I get him in the net.

          I swear to god, if you say “net”
          one more time--

They’re interrupted by BOOTS ON THE PORCH.

It’s happening! They flatten themselves on either side of the    *
shuttered door.

Suddenly the latch SHAKES as the door is jangled.

They’ve never been more scared in their lives. And they
haven’t agreed on a plan. They’re each on their own. Tom
grips his mosquito net. Grace grips her hairspray.               *

The door KICKS IN right between them!

Sunlight catches the dust and splinters as they settle...

Dog-Face sees the empty room and the closed bathroom door
with the SHOWER RUNNING. He steps in and--

Tom whips the mosquito net over his head!

He gets him!! But Tom freezes up, unsure what to do next.        *
Grace jumps in and SPRAYS HER HAIRSPRAY--                        *

Dog-Face is protected by his sunglasses but Tom’s nailed! He
SCREAMS, blinded!

Dog-Face kicks Grace in the stomach and reels back, slamming     *
Tom against coat hooks on the wall. Then he rifle-whips Tom’s
head, right through the net.

Tom spins and hits the floor hard with a sickening THUD.

Dog-Face shirks off the net and it lands on Tom’s face. He       *
aims his gun at Grace. She instantly puts her hands up.          *

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                               *
          Sorry sorry sorry never mind sorry.                    *

Tom puts his hands up too, flat on his back. Under his own       *
net. Head bloody. Eyelids glued shut and stinging like hell.     *

Dog-Face isn’t even out of breath. He grabs Tom’s wrists and
binds them with plastic zipties. He does the same to Grace.     *
Then he uses another ziptie to bind Tom and Grace together.     *

Dog-Face calmly removes his sunglasses and wipes the
hairspray off. Then lifts his walkie-talkie:

                    DOG-FACE                                    *

EXT. JUNGLE ROAD - DAY

Meanwhile, the golf cart drives across the island. Grace and   *
Tom sit ziptied to the back. Grace rambles, nervously.         *

          We actually called off the wedding.
          I was trying to figure out what we
          were gonna tell everyone... but
          now... You guys saved us a very
          awkward announcement. Ha.

                    TOM
          You’re doing your nervous talking
          thing.

          We were so in sync most of the                       *
          time. We both didn’t want kids, we                   *
          love our jobs, we love traveling.                    *
          Oh, we have these adorable pitbulls                  *
          Frankie and Edgar. You must love                     *
          pitbulls! You know, because of the                   *

          we broke up. Yeah, the sex was                      *
          never a problem. I mean, look at                    *

          They can see how handsome I am, you                 *

          I guess we weren’t on the same page                 *
          about marriage. Between my parents’                 *
          divorce and my first engagement, it                 *
          never seemed right for me. Maybe it                 *
          was a self-fulfilling prophecy. Do
          you know what that phrase means
          “self-fulfilling prophecy”?

          I think I was scared of getting                     *
          hurt. But then I met Tom, and it                    *
          was just... easy. Almost too easy,                  *
          y’know? I didn’t trust it. I kept                   *
          waiting for it to get messed up,                    *
          but for some reason it didn’t...                    *

This lands on Tom, despite - you know - the pirates.

Grace shoves her lit cigarette onto Dog-Face’s ski mask. When   *
the ember touches his mask, it IGNITES the hairspray that she   *
sprayed all over him. His whole mask goes up in flames. Dog-    *
Face SCREAMS. Grace SCREAMS. Tom SCREAMS.                       *

Dog-Face JUMPS out of the moving cart to extinguish himself.    *

Bone-Face jumps out to help, but falls, and the back wheel of   *
the cart RUNS OVER his foot. He YELPS.                          *

The cart continues at high speed down a hill. Tom and Grace     *
are zip-tied to the back so they go along for the ride...

Upside down on its roof...

Grace, still seat-belted, hangs upside-down above Tom. Both     *
banged up and bleary-eyed. From Tom’s POV, Grace’s up-do        *
comes loose above him and her hair falls toward his face.       *

          and end this hell.                                    *

Tom pulls at the bent steel bar they’re zip-tied to. Trying
to dislodge it. He kicks it with his heel. Again and again.

BACK AT THE JUNGLE ROAD

Dog-Face is unconscious in the foliage. The stretchy fabric
of his mask has fused with his charred, bubbly face.

Bone-Face isn’t doing great either. A broken foot and road      *
rash on his arm. He reaches for his walkie-talkie... but it’s
smashed. He staggers forward, disoriented, trying to figure     *
out which direction the cart went.                              *

BACK AT THE GOLF CART

Tom and Grace shake to snap the bar to free them. No luck.      *

with all his might.                                             *

WHAM. He flips the cart over. He LAUGHS triumphantly.           *

They try to push the bar through the roof of the cart. Tom      *
gets it a little loose, but then:                               *

foot but the hill gets steeper and they pick up momentum.        *

Tom hoists his long legs over the front seat and reaches the     *
steering wheel.                                                  *

          Left!                                                  *

He steers the cart to the left JUST missing a palm tree.         *
Grace looks backward and directs him.                            *

                      GRACE (CONT'D)                             *
          Right!                                                 *

Tom turns right and they avoid a giant ROCK. Grace’s eyes go     *
wide when she sees:                                              *

          CLIFF!!                                                *

Tom turns to see the cart is headed toward a sheer cliff with    *
a 100 foot drop to a rocky shore.                                *

          The gear shift! Get it into park!                     *

Grace tries to push the gear shift into park with her foot.     *
She kicks with all her might and the gear shift BREAKS OFF.     *
She SCREAMS in frustration.                                     *

Tom turns the cart sharply to the left which HALTS it feet      *
away from the cliff’s edge. They SIGH in relief. But then...    *

The cart now starts sliding backwards AGAIN down ANOTHER hill   *
toward ANOTHER edge of the same cliff.                          *

                       GRACE                                    *
          Come on.                                              *

Grace drags her steel-toed heels into the ground, trying to     *
stop them.

And Tom pulls like hell on the bar, trying to dislodge it--     *
their only way out.                                             *

Tom kicks at a weak part of the bar with his heel and snaps     *
it. Then slides their ziptied wrists off the broken bar...

Right as the golf cart rolls over the edge! For a split         *
second, they’re safe... but Grace gets dragged by the cart!     *

Her dress is caught! The dress rips free just as the golf       *
cart plummets down...

...but Grace hangs in mid-air!                                  *

...because her ziptied wrists are still attached to Tom’s and
he’s splayed on top of the cliff trying to hold her up.

Grace looks down to see the golf-cart CRASH onto ocean rocks!   *

Grace’s weight is pulling Tom slowly over the edge. He can’t    *
grab onto anything with his wrists pulled in front of him.      *

He catches his foot on a tree root. He looks DOWN at Darcy      *
and the 100-foot drop and his VERTIGO kicks in. He shuts his    *
eyes tight.                                                     *

One of Grace’s zip-ties gets CUT by the rocky edge, freeing     *
her left arm and flinging her gravity even further downward.    *

Tom opens his eyes and looks at Grace, dangling, hopeless. He   *
can’t save them. He can’t fix this. They’re gonna die.

Finally he stops being pulled over. But it’s not because of
him... It’s because of Grace.                                   *

She dug her steel-toed shoe into the side of the cliff, using   *
it as a foothold.                                               *

They both freeze, scared to shift their weight a millimeter.

                    TOM
          Don’t move!

Bone-Face reaches the site where the cart crashed and follows   *
the tracks leading down the hill, gun drawn.                    *

ON THE CLIFFS                                                   *

Grace carefully climbs up the cliff-face, dropping her other    *
heel down to the rocky shore below. Using her free hand, she    *
climbs onto Tom, using him as a ladder.                         *

She pulls herself over the edge just in time to see Bone-Face   *
racing down the hill towards them, machine gun out.             *

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                              *

the dirt around them. They hide behind a rock.                  *

                    TOM
          STOP CALLING HIM “BONE FACE GUY”!

BANG-BANG-BANG! --Then silence! Tom steals a peek and sees:     *

Tom yanks Grace to her feet and charges towards him but Grace    *
runs the other way so they go nowhere and HIT THE GROUND.

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          I said run at him!

Bone-Face reloads bullets one-by-one into his magazine.

He sees Tom and Grace sprinting at him! It’s a race!             *

He locks the reloaded magazine and raises to shoot but--

Tom does a killer baseball slide right into his ankles!

Grace’s dragged to the ground, skinning her elbows--             *

Bone-Face scrambles up from his fall. He tries to swing his      *
gun around but Tom head-butts him. Bone-Face’s gun FLIES         *
across the ground and off the cliff.                             *

Grace sees Bone-Face unclip a grenade from his belt--            *

          No no no no!

Grace uses all her strength to pull her (and Tom’s) hands        *
towards it and grab the grenade--

--But Tom’s hands aren’t guarding his face anymore so he gets
PUNCHED RIGHT IN THE NOSE.

Grace and Bone-Face play tug-of-war with the grenade as Bone-    *
Face chokes Tom with his other hand.

Tom and Grace, bloody and full of adrenaline, scramble to       *
stand. Bone-Face lies still, his bloody head hidden from view   *

pirate’s head used to be.                                       *

          Oh my god, I killed him. Grace. I                     *
          killed a man.

          Remember that time when I was
          driving on the highway. And you

          It was smart because if you had
          told me when I was driving, I could

WHAT?! WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? It’s
gonna explode?

          TOM
No no no, just hold it exactly like         *
you are. Don’t change a thing. The          *
pin holds the handle on. So when
the pin’s not there... as soon as
you let go of the grenade... the
handle pops off. And that starts
the fuse. And THEN it blows up.

Well, my concern is you won’t be

not blow us up. No offense.

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

Tom and Grace climb over vines and logs. Grace’s free hand     *
holds the grenade and their zip-tied hands hold the phone.     *

out: her hair extensions. She shoves them into Tom’s pocket.   *

          and all the things that could go
          wrong, like, “Oh no, what if the
          cake is too sweet,” but I was never
          like: “What if we’re walking
          through a jungle with a grenade?”

          overthink everything, I’m surprised                  *
          there wasn’t a section for this in                   *

          of? Remember our first Valentine’s

This hangs there a little. Then:

          This is basically what marriage is,
          right? Walking handcuffed through a
          jungle with another person who is
          carrying a live grenade?

                    TOM
          More or less. Is that really so                        *
          scary?                                                 *

Grace laughs. Tom looks at her for a moment, wanting her to      *
say more, but then Grace’s dress gets snagged on a branch and    *
she trips, bringing Tom down with her.

She drops her phone and nearly drops the grenade. Holy shit.     *

            GRACE                               TOM (CONT'D)
I got it, I got it, I got it!      You got it, you got it, you

          Shit! It’s gone.                                       *

She moves their arms wildly in the sky, hoping to get the bar    *
back. Then her eyes lands on something with an ide.              *

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                               *
          We have to go higher.                                  *

                    TOM                                          *
          What?                                                  *

Tom turns to see what Grace is looking at: A rickety vertical    *
staircase with a sign that reads: “TO ZIPLINE PLATFORM.”         *

                    TOM (CONT'D)                                 *
          No. Grace. No.                                         *

EXT. JUNGLE ROAD - DAY                                          *

Ghost-Face and Shark-Face walk up the road... right past Dog-   *
Face’s unconscious body, in the foliage, without knowing.       *


EXT. ZIPLINE STAIRCASE - DAY                                    *

CLOSE ON Tom, eyes closed tight, sweating bullets.              *

                      TOM                                       *
          Anything?                                             *

                    GRACE                                       *
          Yes! Wait, no. Keep going. We’re                      *
          almost at the top.                                    *

REVEAL they are walking up the vertical stairs, nearing the     *
platform. Tom is on the verge of a panic attack.                *

                    TOM                                         *
          Maybe we should just go back down                     *
          and try not being up high.                            *

Grace ignores him as they land on the top of the platform.      *

                    GRACE                                       *
          We got bars! Multiple bars!!                          *

She dials. As she does, she’s startled by a piercing SHRIEK.    *

Then a WHOLE CHORUS OF SHRIEKS. It’s a gang of long-tailed
macaque monkeys. High up in the trees, surprised to be five
feet away and eye-level with a couple of humans.

                    TOM
          Shhh! Shhhhhh!

ON THE JUNGLE ROAD                                              *

Shark-Face and Ghost-Face are hiking deeper into the jungle     *
when they hear the SHRIEKING. They look at each other and
detour toward the sound...                                      *

BACK WITH TOM AND GRACE                                         *

The macaque monkeys are trying to scare Tom and Grace off,      *
guarding a crab they were feasting on.

                    GRACE                                       *
          They think we want their crab. Hey!
          Monkeys! Listen to me! We don’t                       *
          want your crab!
                      Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)               65.


BANG! A bullet whizzes through the air, causing the monkeys      *
to FLEE and Grace to DROP HER PHONE. The phone falls down to     *
the jungle floor where we see:                                   *

Shark-Face and Ghost-Face, 500 feet ahead of them, aiming        *
their guns at Tom and Grace from the jungle floor.               *

                      SHARK-FACE
          Get down!

                    GRACE                                        *
          Sure, okay, no prob! One sec!                          *
              (whispered, to Tom)                                *
          We gotta zip.                                          *

                      TOM                                        *
          Zip?                                                   *

Grace head nods to the SADDLE in front of them connected to      *
the zipline. BANG! Another bullet flies right past them.         *

                    TOM (CONT'D)                                 *
          We can’t! We don’t have all the                        *
          proper equipment.                                      *

                    GRACE                                        *
          Well, they have guns!                                  *

BANG-BANG-BANG! Shark-Face fires more warning shots.             *

                    SHARK-FACE                                   *
          Ay! Down. Now.                                         *

                    GRACE                                        *
          Sure thing! We’re on it!                               *

                    TOM                                          *
          Grace, I just don’t think--                            *

She’s had enough. She shoves Tom onto the saddle, straddles      *
him and KICKS OFF the platform.                                  *

Tom SCREAMS in terror as they CAREEN at through the jungle,      *
the line leading them right over the Pirates on the ground.      *

The Pirates SHOOT in their direction. One bullet whizzes         *
right past Grace’s head.                                         *

They gain speed, getting closer to the pirates. Grace makes a    *
silent decision. Just when they are over the pirates, Grace      *
trapezes upside down and releases the grenade from her hand.     *

The spring-loaded handle pops off as it falls!                   *
                   Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)               66.


The grenade lands right between the pirates and...             *

KABOOM!
They’re blown to pieces.

The zipline gains speed as Grace and Tom fly off SCREAMING.    *


EXT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY

The hostages cry out in horror and the pirates stare stunned   *
at the trail of smoke snaking up over the distant jungle.      *

                    PIRATE LEADER
              (into his walkie-talkie)
          What the hell was that?

No reply. Uh oh. He’s angry now. Everything is going wrong.    *

                    PIRATE LEADER (CONT'D)                     *
              (to Clown-Face)                                  *
          We go check it out.                                  *

The Pirate Leader aims his gun at the hostages and shouts:     *

                    PIRATE LEADER (CONT'D)                     *
          Everyone! Go deeper in the pool!                     *

The hostages swim to the deep end, terrified. Renee,           *
seemingly frozen in fear, stays in the shallow end.            *

                    PIRATE LEADER (CONT'D)                     *
          I said GO!!                                          *

                    ROBERT / JAMIE                             *
          Renee!! / Mom!!                                      *

                    RENEE                                      *
          I don’t like getting my hair wet!                    *

                    CAROL (O.C.)                               *
          Yoohoo, Renee! Take this!                            *

ANGLE ON Carol, lounging in a floatie. She pushes a matching   *
floatie to Renee, who takes it graciously.                     *

The Pirate Leader rushes toward the jeep with Tiger-Face.      *

                    PIRATE LEADER                              *
          Fucking Americans...                                 *
                    Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)              67.


Clown-Face starts up the jeep as the Pirate Leader hops in      *
and they speed into the jungle towards the smoke.               *

Tiger-Face and Rat-Face stay back to guard the pool. Tiger-     *
Face throws a few more floaties and noodles to the hostages.    *


EXT. JUNGLE / BEACH - DAY                                       *

Grace and Tom are FLYING down the zipline. They careen toward   *
a zipline platform by the ocean. Grace dismounts perfectly,     *
like a superhero. Tom falls off the saddle, flat on his back.   *

                    TOM                                         *
          I will never understand why people                    *
          pay actual money to do that--                         *

                    GRACE                                       *
          Tom, look...                                          *

Tom turns around to see they landed right where the ceremony    *
was supposed to take place. Literally right in front of the     *
rows of rented white chairs.                                    *

They see purses left behind in the chaos. Tom sees a plastic
water cup with “Carol” written in sharpie. His poor mom.

The refreshments table with a white table cloth and a glass     *
dispenser of cucumber water. The wooden arch covered with       *
flowers, wilting in the hot sun.

Tom looks at Grace and sees her eyes are glassy. It’s           *
emotional being here. The wedding that never was.


EXT. CRATER - DAY

The Pirate Leader and Clown-Face stand at a crater of gore,     *
trying to make sense of this gruesome tableau. They see parts   *
of their comrades, but no trace of Tom and Grace.               *

                    CLOWN-FACE                                  *
          I thought you said these were dumb                    *
          tourists.                                             *

He lifts a shredded mask of one of his men. Affected.

                    PIRATE LEADER
          My information was wrong. These                       *
          people are sick. You find them, but                   *
          I kill them. Understood?                              *

Then they hear RUSTLING in the banana trees. They all aim
their guns... ready for anything...
                    Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)              68.


...when out staggers Dog-Face, with his burned face.

                    DOG-FACE
          You can have the man. The bride is
          mine.


EXT. BEACH - DAY

Tom holds the silver faucet open and gulps down water from      *
the big glass vat on the refreshments table.

Grace looks out at the shimmering ocean to the next island on   *
the horizon, with lots of colorful sails. It’s a busy marina.   *

                    GRACE                                       *
          Police... Coast Guard... They’re
          all right there.

                    TOM                                         *
          We’ll make it, we just have to--                      *

                    PIRATE VOICE (O.S.)
          Carol Fowler! Be quiet!

Grace and Tom look at each other, surprised. They whisper:      *

            GRACE                               TOM
Carol?                          Mom?                            *

Grace and Tom follow the sound of the voice up a hillside. As   *
they crest the hill, they see the pool through palm fronds:

                     GRACE (CONT'D)                             *
              (under her breath)
          Oh my god.                                            *

All their loved ones are huddled shivering in the pool in
their fancy clothes. Pirates pace with guns.                    *

                    TOM                                         *
          Are our moms on floaties?                             *

ANGLE ON Carol and Renee, indeed both on floaties.              *

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          This is all my fault...                               *

                    GRACE                                       *
          It’s not just you, they’re here for                   *
          us. My poor mom. She thought she                      *
          could avoid my dad all weekend...                     *
                     Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                69.


                    TOM
          Oh? She didn’t want to be held
          hostage with him in a pool?

Grace stares at her parents in the pool, turned away from        *
each other.                                                      *

                    GRACE                                        *
          This one time I saw a video of my                      *
          mom and dad when they were young...                    *
          before they got married, before all                    *
          the fighting started... they were                      *
          dancing at a party and they just                       *
          seemed so happy. So in love. My mom                    *
          was watching that video the night                      *
          my dad left. He broke her heart.                       *

Grace tries to fight the emotion. She can’t look Tom in the      *
eye, so she stares forward at her parents in the pool.

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                               *
          I loved our relationship so much,                      *
          Tom, I just was scared if we got                       *
          married... I didn’t want to ruin                       *
          it. But we ruined it anyway.                           *

                     TOM
          Grace...                                               *

Grace shakes off her tears and puts up her tough veneer.         *

                    GRACE                                        *
          It’s fine, we don’t have time for                      *
          this. We have to keep moving.                          *

                    TOM
          Hang on. Look.                                         *

Grace looks where Tom is pointing: Robert giving Renee his       *
straw hat. He gives her a warm smile. She nods at him,           *
grateful. Grace can’t believe it-- the first nice moment         *
between her parents in years.

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          Oh. Also...

Tom points. ANGLE ON Ricky blocking Jamie from the sun.

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          What’s going on there?

                    TOM
          That is a trainwreck and I love it.                   *

                    GRACE                                       *
          Me too.                                               *

ANGLE ON Tom’s nephew, Scotty, who suddenly spots Tom and
Grace through the palms. He gets excited and waves at them.     *

                    SCOTTY                                      *
              (calling out)
          Hey! Uncle Tom!

Everyone in the pool turns around, looking towards where he’s
pointing. Rat-Face spots them and races toward them.            *

            GRACE                               TOM

          The kitchen!                                          *


INT. RESORT KITCHEN - DAY

Tom and Grace sneak into the resort kitchen. It’s a MESS:       *

The stove is on, left by the cooks who were taken hostage.      *
Sinks are running over. Cold appetizers sit on the counters.    *

They turn off the stove and the sink and looks through          *
drawers. Grace pulls him toward the appetizers.                 *

                    TOM
          We just need to get a knife... what                   *
          are you doing?

                    GRACE                                       *
          I’m starving. Did you eat anything                    *
          today?

                    TOM
          No. I’m not hungry.

                    GRACE                                       *
          Eat.

Grace puts a tray in front of him. They both eat ravenously.    *

                    TOM
          I am hungry. You’re right.
                     Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                71.


                    GRACE                                        *
          Most couples never get to eat at
          their own wedding!

Suddenly, the SOUND of pirates outside-- boots and a voice on    *
a walkie-talkie. Grace and Tom freeze. Grace pulls him to...     *

THE WALK-IN FRIDGE

They swing open the heavy door and see: A perfect tiered
wedding cake on a rolling cart.                                  *

Tom looks under the rolling cart and sees the cake knife set
with a post-it note from his mom on the top: “Don’t forget!
Love, Carol (Mom).” Tom points at it. Grace gets emotional.      *

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                               *
          I love your mom.

Grace grabs the knife and tries to cut the ziptie with her       *
free hand. She awkwardly saws but it doesn’t penetrate the       *
hard plastic. She saws harder.

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                               *
          I can’t do it with my left hand.                       *

                    TOM                                          *
          I can’t do it with any hands.                          *

Grace sees Rat-Face outside a window, searching for them.        *
They duck their heads down to hide from view.                    *

And then Tom sees through the door back in the kitchen: An       *
INDUSTRIAL MEAT SLICER. His eyes light up.                       *

OUTSIDE                                                          *

Rat-Face creeps past the kitchen doors slowly, eyes wide,        *
listening closely. Hunting with determination.                   *

IN THE KITCHEN                                                   *

Tom and Grace hold out their connected wrists inches from the    *
meat slicer’s massive circular blade. Grace looks panicked.      *

                    GRACE                                        *
          Is this a bad idea?                                    *

                    TOM                                          *
          Yes. You ready?                                        *

                     GRACE                                       *
          No.                                                    *
                   Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                 72.


Grace cautiously presses a button. The blade WHIRRS to life.    *
They slowly slide their wrists toward the rapidlt spinning      *
blade. It’s terrifying. Grace yanks them back.                  *

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                              *
          Hang on, hang on, new idea: what if                   *
          we just stay ziptied?                                 *

                    TOM                                         *
          Grace. We can do this.                                *

She nods and puts their wrists back on the surface and slowly   *
move toward the blade. ON TOM, staring straight ahead...        *

                    TOM (CONT'D)                                *
          Are your eyes closed?                                 *

ON GRACE, opening her closed eyes.                              *

                    GRACE                                       *
          Nope.                                                 *

As they make contact, Grace FLINCHES, pulling Tom’s wrist a     *
centimeter closer to the blade. Before she can correct it...    *

SWISH. The blade cuts through the zip-ties and slices deep      *
into Tom’s hand. Tom goes sheet-white. Shuts his eyes.          *

                    TOM
              (muffled cry)
          Aaaaahhh.

OUTSIDE                                                         *

Rat-Face hears the cry inside the kitchen and rushes back       *
toward the door.                                                *

IN THE KITCHEN                                                  *

Tom, in intense pain, whispers to Grace. He can’t look.         *

                    TOM (CONT'D)                                *
          How bad is it?

                    GRACE                                       *
          Ummm?

Grace looks at Tom’s hand GUSHING BLOOD down her dress. NOPE.   *

Grace passes out and hits the floor just as...                  *

Rat-Face KICKS OPEN the kitchen door. Tom DUCKS behind the      *
kitchen island before Rat-Face can see him.                     *
                    Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)              73.


As Rat-Face skulks by the other side of the island, Tom drags   *
Grace across the floor to hide, but then sees:                  *

He’s mopping the floor with her bloody wedding dress, leaving   *
a streaky trail. He’s out of options.                           *

Rat-Face curiously walks over to the whirring meat-slicer. As   *
he does, he nearly trips over:                                  *

Grace on the floor in her wedding dress in a pool of blood.     *
Rat-Face looks back at the meat slicer. And the down again at   *
the bloody bride. What the hell happened?                       *

He aims his gun and gives her a kick to see if she’s dead.      *

Grace stirs awake to see Rat-Face standing over her with the    *
barrel of his shotgun pointed at her. She looks around.         *

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                              *
          ...Tom?

He’s gone. She’s going to die. Alone.

Then Rat-Face GASPS, stiffens, and falls forward, landing
inches from Grace with Carol’s cake knife IN HIS BACK.          *

Grace looks up and sees Tom standing over them with his         *
wounded hand in his white tuxedo jacket pocket stained red.
He tries to act like he’s not about to pass out.

                    TOM
          Right here.

Grace’s eyes water. So relieved. He helps her up, and even      *
though they’re not ziptied anymore, their hands linger.         *

                    GRACE                                       *
          I thought you left.                                   *

                    TOM
          Never.                                                *

This hits Grace. They hold eye contact, and then Tom looks      *
down at the dead pirate. He puts his shoe on the pirate’s       *
back and pulls the cake knife out.                              *

                    TOM (CONT'D)                                *
          Oh fuck, oh God, I’m sorry, sir.                      *

                    GRACE                                       *
          Hey, can I borrow that knife?                         *
                   Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)               74.


Tom hands her the knife, curious. She cleans it off with a     *
towel, hikes her dress and slices through her suffocating      *
shape wear. She can finally breathe... It’s been hours.        *

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                             *
          Spanx are the devil’s work.                          *

She throws the shapewear at the buzzing meat slicer and it     *
rips into tatters.                                             *

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                             *
              (nodding to the pirate)                          *
          Can you get those boots off him?

Grace saws off the bottom two feet of her dress. Tom yanks     *
off the dead Pirate’s combat boots and passes them to Grace.   *

He looks through the pirate’s pockets and steals the walkie-   *
talkie. And then he finds something else: a paper invitation   *
to Tom and Grace’s wedding. Huh. That’s weird.                 *

                    GRACE (O.S.) (CONT'D)                      *
          That’s better.                                       *

Tom turns around to see in the surreal sight of his fiancée:   *

Messy cropped hair, combat boots, a blood-streaked and         *
shredded wedding dress, holding Rat-Face’s shotgun. Grace      *
notices Tom gawking at her.                                    *

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                             *
          What?

                    TOM
          That dress is growing on me.

                    GRACE                                      *
          Yeah? You like it? I wanted
          something less traditional.

                    TOM
          I think you got there.

They hear a pirate coming and hurry out a back door just       *
missing the pirate pursuing them: Dog-Face. Out for blood.     *


EXT. RESORT LOBBY - BACK SIDE - CONTINUOUS                     *

They scan the area and see: a house tucked away behind the     *
pool. They rush inside.                                        *

INT. HOUSE - DAY                                                *

They enter a charming home filled with plants, knick-knacks,    *
framed photos. Grace looks at one: it’s a photo of Marge.       *

They peek into a room to find Marge’s office. Tom rushes over   *
to the computer.                                                *

                    TOM                                         *
          Maybe she has a separate internet                     *
          connection...                                         *

With his bloody hands, he clicks the mouse and checks the       *
connection. No luck.                                            *

                    TOM (CONT'D)                                *
          Nope. But wow does Marge love                         *
          Corgis.                                               *

ANGLE ON: Marge’s computer desktop, which is a collage of       *
Corgi pictures. She also has a Corgi mousepad and a coffee      *
mug shaped like a Corgi.                                        *

Grace peeks out the shutters to the jungle and sees Dog-Face    *
and Tiger-Face searching through the trees.                     *

                    GRACE                                       *
          We’re trapped. What do we do?                         *

                    TOM                                         *
          I don’t know...                                       *

Suddenly a trap door in the floor CREAKS open below them.       *
Grace reels around to shoot but her gun is grabbed by--         *

Marge! Holding one of Tom’s DIY mason jar lanterns. She holds
a finger to her mouth like “Shhh.” Then waves them in.


INT. PANIC ROOM - DAY

Grace and Tom descend into the dirt-walled panic room. There    *
are a few shovels and a tunnel.

            GRACE                            TOM
You saved our lives!            Marge! Ace! Oh my God!          *

Ace flashes Tom a gold tooth smile. He’s holding a mason jar
lantern and a shovel. Marge is desperate for information:

volume. He hears Pirates talking but it’s not English.

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          But they don’t know we all are. I’m
          sorry about everything.                               *

                    GRACE                                       *
          Tom! Hang on! We were having a                        *
          fight! You can’t just stop the
          fight and sacrifice yourself for
          me! That’s not fair!                                  *

Not listening, Tom hands Grace the shotgun and hoists himself   *
out of the hatch and closes it.                                 *

IN THE OFFICE NOW                                               *

Tom pushes the heavy desk over the hatch so it can’t be re-     *
opened. He creeps into the living room and spots Dog-Face and   *
Clown-Face in the kitchen, with their backs to him.             *

                    TOM
          Hey, Dog-Face Guy! It’s me, the                       *
          groom from earlier?                                   *

They turn around and train their guns on him.                   *

                    TOM (CONT'D)                                *
          And you must be Tiger-Face Guy. A                     *
          pleasure. My name is Tom and I                        *
          would really like it if no one else                   *
          got hurt so I am going to                             *
          surrender, okay?

They stick their guns to his back aggressively and walk him     *
out of the house.                                               *


INT. TUNNEL - SAME TIME

Grace’s ear is pressed up against the hatch. She hears them     *
march Tom out of the house.                                     *

                    GRACE                                       *
              (emotional, relieved)                             *
          They didn’t kill him! He’s still                      *
          alive! Oh my god... I’m going to                      *
          kill him.

Grace smiles, overwhelmed by what Tom did for her. She grabs    *
a shovel and starts shoveling with determination.               *


EXT. RESORT POOL - DAY

Tom is walked out to the pool by Dog-Face and Tiger-Face at     *
gunpoint. The hostages are shocked--                            *

                    WEDDING GUESTS                              *
          Tom! / Are you okay?? / Where’s                       *
          Grace? / I really have to pee.                        *

                    TOM
          Heyyy... Everyone having fun at the
          wedding?

The Pirate Leader walks up to Tom with a stapler in hand. Tom
flinches, but the Leader just staples his name card to his      *
bloody tux jacket: “Groom”

                    PIRATE LEADER
          Where’s your bride?

                    TOM
          Fuck if I know.                                       *

The guests react: What’s going on?                              *

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          As soon as she cut through the
          zipties, she was gone. She wanted                     *
          to get the hell away from me. She
          took most of my hand with her.

Tom nods to his duct-taped hand.

                    PIRATE LEADER                               *
          You are a bad liar.                                   *

                    CAROL                                       *
              (whispered to Larry)                              *
          He really is.                                         *

                    SEAN
          Tom, if you know something, please                    *
          tell them. The best thing we can do
          is cooperate. They just want money.                   *

Tom looks at Sean and in spite of everything, smiles.           *

                    TOM                                         *
          You’re right, Sean. Thank you as                      *
          always for being a voice of reason.                   *
              (then, to Pirate Leader)                          *
          Okay, I’ll tell you where she is.                     *

Tom approaches the Pirate Leader and leans in to whisper so     *
only he can hear:                                               *

The Pirate Leader UZI-whips Tom’s jaw. Ouch. Then throws him
into the pool with the rest of the hostages.

                    SEAN
          Jesus. What did you say to him?

Tom adjusts his jacket but we see he’s actually pulled the
tattered floral boutonniere from his lapel. Up to something.

                    TOM
          Hard to explain. Sort of an inside
          joke. Can you give me a hand,                          *
          buddy? Feeling a little woozy.                         *

Tom puts an arm around Sean’s shoulder to support himself in
the water. But it was a trap!

Tom gets Sean in a choke-hold, and holds the sharp pin of the
boutonniere an inch from Sean’s eye.

                    SEAN
          WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING--

Tom strains to hold Sean.

                    TOM
          Stop moving or you lose the eye.

Sean stops struggling and goes cross-eyed staring at the
needle an inch from his eye. Panicked.

                    SEAN
          They’ll kill you!

                    TOM
          Now why would they do that?

All the guests SCREAM at Tom. The Pirates aim their guns at
him, alarmed and confused.

                    CAROL
          Tom! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

                    TOM
          You want to explain or should I?

                    SEAN
          EXPLAIN. WHAT.

                    SEAN                                       *
          Whoooaa, Tom, that is a serious                      *
          accusation. But it’s okay. Jealousy                  *
          can get the better of all of us.                     *

                    TOM                                        *
          I’m not jealous!!                                    *

The guests (and some pirate) trade looks: he sounds jealous.   *

                    SEAN                                       *
          It’s natural to see me as a threat                   *
          because Grace and I shared                           *
          something transcendent, but I’m not                  *
          the bad guy here. And I certainly                    *
          am not involved with these pirates.                  *

                    TOM
          Oh yeah? Then why did that pirate                    *
          deck me when I told him to go fuck                   *
          his grandpa?                                         *

          What did you think he was gonna do?
          / Why’d you say that? / Huh?

                    TOM                                        *
          I said it in Balinese! These pirate                  *
          aren’t local, they’re from Bali.                     *
          That’s why they separated us from
          the staff. They would have known                     *
          these guys were imposters. Marge                     *
          said the pirates just looted and                     *
          left last time. It took 20 minutes.                  *

          They’re heavily armed. They’re only                  *

          up. Until I found this.                              *

Everyone waits for something dramatic to happen but nothing    *
does. Tom, still holding Sean, whispers to Ricky.              *

          Yes. But I found it on one of the                    *
          pirates. Now how did a pirate get a                  *
          hold of our wedding invitation? It                   *
          had to be given to him by an                         *
          invited guest. And not just anyone:                  *
          the only guest who didn’t RSVP.                      *

          Will you open it...                                  *

Ricky opens invitation and the RSVP card falls out.            *

          And hold it up.                                      *

INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Grace digs with a fury. Ace spreads the dirt out as they go.    *
Marge lights the way with a mason jar lantern.                  *

                    MARGE
          I thought mason jars at weddings
          were over, but these are adorable!
          Did you make these?

Grace glances back at the lantern. For some reason this         *
compliment makes Grace cry.                                     *

                    GRACE                                       *
          Tom made them. He wanted us to have
          the perfect wedding and I messed
          everything up...

shovel to Ace. Wipes the sweat and dirt off her face.

          it’s not magic. Marriage isn’t as                     *

Tom sits in a pool chair as the Pirate Leader holds a gun to     *
his head. Sean watches.

                    SEAN
          You’re in the big leagues now, Tom.

          falling off.

The Pirate Leader clocks him with the back of his gun.

Then Tom sees... twenty feet away... a sinkhole forming. Oh      *
shit. It’s Grace digging. She’s gonna pop out in plain view.     *

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          Fine! I’ll tell you. After we cut                      *
          ourselves loose, Grace and I got                       *
          into a fight. She took off in a                        *

Sean climbs into the helicopter and it takes off. The sound     *
is deafening. Wind blows Tom’s hair back... makes waves in      *
the crowded pool...

Tiger-Face and Dog-Face stay behind to guard the hostages.      *
Suddenly, they hear a SCRAPING NOISE, turn, and see a shovel    *
stab out of the grass--

Grace crawls out of the earth in a dirt-covered, ripped, and    *
bloody wedding dress. Brandishing a shotgun.                    *

          the middle of a fight, Tom!

She squints into the blinding sunlight, trying to find Tom.

The pirates point their guns at her, and she points her gun     *
at them. It’s a stand-off. She looks strong, confident. She’s
almost unrecognizable, in an awesome way.

          Marge, we need you up here to                         *
          officiate...                                          *

The guests are confused and scared but they go along with it.   *

                    DOG-FACE                                    *
          No, stop it!                                          *

          Let ‘em do it. Why not?                               *

                       DOG-FACE                                 *
          What?!                                                *

          I love weddings.                                      *

                    GRACE                                       *
          Dad, will you do the honors?                          *

Grace smiles at her dad. Robert takes her arm and walks down    *
the “aisle” towards Tom at the shallow end. Grace looks at      *
Marge, signaling with her eyes toward Dog-Face. She nods.       *

Grace looks at Tom. For a second, they get lost in this         *
moment. A bride walking down the aisle to her groom. Grace      *
lands at the “altar,” next to Tom. Holding hands.               *

                    TOM
          Jeannie, you were going to do a                       *
          reading, right?                                       *

Jeannie, terrified, shakes her head. She’s too scared.

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          That’s okay, don’t worry--

          The skies above are blue                             *

Grace and Tom can’t believe it. Everyone is finally united.    *
Even Tiger-Face wipes a tear from his eye.                     *

                    GUESTS (CONT'D)                            *
          My heart was wrapped up in clover                    *
          The night I looked at you                            *

Grace, Tom and Marge look at each other and NOD. Together      *
they RUSH the two pirates:                                     *

-Tom KICKS a stunned Tiger-Face in the stomach.                *

-Marge pulls an impressive KRAV-MAGA-style Elbow Strike on     *
Dog Face, knocking him down.                                   *

-Grace yanks at Dog-Face’s belt as he scrambles for his gun.   *

-Tiger-Face scrambles back up and grabs his gun.               *

-Dog-Face gets his gun and flips around, aiming it at Grace.   *

                    DOG-FACE
          I finally get to kill you.                           *

The hostages look on, breathless. Terrified.                   *

                    GRACE                                      *
          I think you’d regret that.

Then Dog-Face sees Grace is holding one of his grenades. She   *
spits the grenade’s pin into the dirt. Smiling.

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                             *
          I’m still fairly new to grenades...
          but I’m pretty sure if you shoot
          me... this springy thing pops loose                  *
          and this thing blows us all inside
          out. Is that right, sweetie?

                    TOM
          That’s right, darling.                                *

The Pirates look like they’re regretting the choices that led   *
them to this moment.

                    GRACE                                       *
          Drop the guns.

Tiger-Face immediately drops his gun and puts his hands up.     *
Dog-Face doesn’t want to back down. Not again. Suddenly he      *
sprints down to the lawn below the pool.                        *

As Ace cuffs Tiger-Face with his own zipties, a bullet flies    *
past Grace. Dog-Face is SHOOTING AT GRACE from the lawn.        *

                    TOM                                         *
          Everyone, get down!                                   *

The guests in the pool duck. Some go under water. Bullets       *
whiz through the air.                                           *

ON LARRY, shielding Scotty in the pool. A bullet flies past     *
Larry, grazing his arm. He yelps.                               *

ON RENEE, cowering as BANG! Someone next to her returns fire    *
at Dog-Face. She turns to see:                                  *

CAROL, out of the pool, behind a lounge chair, holding          *
Grace’s shotgun like a badass. She fires again, shouting.       *

                    CAROL                                       *
          No one shoots my sweet husband, you                   *
          fuck!                                                 *

Renee stares, stunned. Impressed.                               *

ON GRACE and TOM, huddled behind a chair. She looks at the      *
grenade in her hand.                                            *

                     GRACE                                      *
          I can’t throw that far. I won’t                       *
          reach him.                                            *

Tom grabs a DECORATIVE STATUE nearby, wielding it like a bat.   *

                    TOM                                         *
          Put me in coach.                                      *

ON THE LAWN, Dog-Face ducks behind a TABLE for cover. Then      *
peeks to see:                                                   *

Tom standing, curiously armed with nothing but a statue--       *

Suddenly Grace tosses a grenade straight up...                  *

TOM SWINGS HIS TABLE LEG LIKE A BAT AND NAILS IT--              *

The grenade flies straight toward Dog-Face hitting the          *
table... which happens to be the FIREWORKS STAND.               *

It EXPLODES! A GEYSER OF BLOOD ERUPTS and the FIREWORKS SHOOT   *
IN THE SKY in every direction. It’s SPECTACULAR.                *

All the guests peek to watch, momentarily mesmerized by the     *
fireworks. They break out into WILD APPLAUSE AND CHEERS.        *

Scotty’s jaw is on the floor, having just witnessed his uncle   *
doing the single most badass thing that’s ever happened.        *

                    TOM (CONT'D)                                *
          Really glad that worked. Or else                      *
          the “Put me in coach” would’ve                        *
          really hung in the air.                               *

Grace laughs. Proud. But there’s no time to celebrate. They     *
see the helicopter in the distance, headed back this way.       *

                    GRACE                                       *

Ace, guarding Tiger-Face, spots KEYS around his neck.           *

          Let’s get moving! Out of the pool!                    *

As the fireworks shoot overhead, the guests help each other     *
out of the pool, as Ace leads the way.                          *

ANGLE ON Carol, handing Renee a towel as they go.               *

BACK ON ACE, using the keys to unlock.. THE SPA                  *

The guests follow Ace into a gorgeous one-room spa, full of      *

          Also please be careful! I love you!                   *

Tom pushes the door shut. Grace wraps the chain around the      *
handle and snaps the padlock shut again. Slips the lanyard
key in Tom’s jacket pocket.

Grace hikes her wedding dress up her thigh, revealing her       *
garter belt. She slides the cake knife in it to hold it on
her thigh, like she’s fucking Rambo in a wedding dress.

              (yelling through the door)                        *
          Also, Carol? Thank you for the cake
          knife. I love this cake knife.                        *

Tom straps Tiger-Face’s Uzi to his arm, preparing for the big   *
showdown.                                                       *

                    TOM
          Just you and me.

The sound of the HELICOPTER LANDING is deafening. They turn     *
to see the helicopter has just touched down 100 yards away.     *

Tom and Grace lock eyes with Sean and Harriett for a second     *
and then break into a SPRINT down the trail to the dock. Sean   *
runs after them, in pursuit.                                    *


EXT. TRAIL - DAY                                                *

SLO-MO SEQUENCE: Etta James’ original “AT LAST” plays as...     *

Tom and Grace run for their lives down a trail to the docks.    *

Sean chases them, shooting warning shots in their direction.    *

Tom and Grace duck and dodge bullets. They hop over rocks and   *
logs. Grace trips but Tom catches her before she can fall.      *

Sean gains on them and finally catches up to them. He GRABS     *
Grace by the arm as we...                                       *

END SLO-MO / END SONG                                           *

Grace turns to look at Sean with fiery anger.                   *

                    GRACE                                       *
          I dumped you! Move ON!                                *

Grace SHOVES Sean off the trail. He TUMBLES down rocks and      *
falls hard. Tom keeps running, but laughs, satisfied.           *


EXT. DOCK - MOMENTS LATER                                       *

Lizard-Face sits on the dock, “guarding it,” gun on his lap,    *
headphones on, playing a game on his phone. He is unaware of    *
anything that transpired today.                                 *

Suddenly, the barrel of an Uzi is in Lizard-Face’s ... face.    *
He stands up, dropping everything, with his hands up.           *

          I don’t shoot. I ziptie,

          A few hours.                                          *

Grace whips out a pair of zipties and ties him to the dock.     *

As she finishes, BANG! BANG! They spins to see Sean, banged     *
up and pissed, up the trail running toward them.                *

They duck for cover behind the Amanpulo Island Resort sign.     *

                    SEAN                                        *
              (shouting)                                        *
          Gracie, this is all a big                             *
          misunderstanding! We can work this                    *
          out!! I don’t want to hurt you!                       *

BANG! BANG! BANG! A bullet clip the side of the sign.           *

                    GRACE                                       *
              (shouting back)                                   *
          Then stop shooting at us, asshole!                    *

          And stop calling her Gracie!                          *
              (then, to Grace)                                  *
          I’ll hold him off. Get the boat!

                       GRACE                                    *
          Which one?

Tom points to the one covered by a tarp. Tom SHOOTS back at     *
Sean, forcing Sean to duck behind a palm tree.                  *

Grace runs and rips the tarp off, revealing--                   *

The gorgeous 1973 Riva Aquarama speedboat decked out in white
streamers with “Just Married” spelled out in wooden letters.

She freezes. Stunned. Or maybe just dazed from blood loss.

          Keys are under the seat!
                     Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)              107.


Grace snaps out of it, saws through the anchor-rope with the    *
cake knife and climbs aboard.

                     GRACE                                      *
          Got ‘em!

She starts the motor, opens up the throttle and pulls away
from the dock. Tom runs and jumps onto the back just in time!

They speed off... dragging the “Just Married” buoys in their
wake like tin cans.

BACK ON THE DOCK,

Sean climbs onto a resort speedboat with a huge engine and a
tow-line on the back for parasailing.

He starts the engine up and it ROARS to life, so fast the
nose shoots up out of the water...

IN THE “JUST MARRIED” BOAT,

Turquoise water turns dark blue as they get into open ocean.
They just have to get to the marina on the horizon!

But Sean’s parasailing boat is catching up.

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                              *
          I should’ve known he was a
          psychopath. Who doesn’t RSVP to a
          wedding and then shows late up in a                   *
          fucking helicopter?

                     TOM
          RIGHT???

As Grace guns the engine she sees the picnic basket and the     *
champagne bottle floating in a bucket of melted ice.

                    GRACE                                       *
          So. You had this all planned?

          Just you and me, out in the middle                    *
          of the ocean...

Tom smiles at her sadly. Grace stares at him, moved.            *

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          Hey. I wanted to say... You’re                        *
          right. I disappeared on you and--

BANG! BANG! BANG! Sean shoots at their boat. Tom and Grace      *
DUCK as he keeps talking.                                       *
                     Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)            108.

          I thought a perfect wedding would                    *
          mean a perfect marriage. But that’s                  *
          not real-- Look at my parents. And                   *
          my Aunt Marie, the sex addict-- but                  *
          the point is, I need you to know--

          Hold on!

Grace SHARPLY TURNS THE BOAT to try and get away from Sean.    *
It works for a moment-- Sean is forced to change directions.

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                             *
          What were you saying?

                    TOM
          I love you. And I never stopped
          loving you because it’s not fucking
          possible for me to stop loving you--
          And I’m sorry I didn’t see how                       *
          scared you were and-- Do you think,
          if we’re both alive tomorrow, we                     *
          could just start over?                               *

                     GRACE                                     *
          No.

                    TOM
          No? What do you mean “no”?

BANG. A bullet hits the boat. Sean is on their tail again.     *
Tom shoots, as Grace speeds up the boat.                       *

MORE GUNFIRE FROM SEAN, then the gunfire stops.

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          He’s out of ammo!

Tom leans over the back of the boat and SPRAYS RETURN FIRE
until-- CLICK CLICK.                                           *

Suddenly, Sean’s boat pulls side by side. He drives the boat
with one hand, in a dripping wet tux. Still cool as hell.

                    SEAN
          Hey. We’re both out of ammo. I                       *
          think it’s time we go back to the                    *
          resort and have a chat!                              *

Tom grabs the champagne bottle POPS THE CORK. BLASTING IT
RIGHT into Sean’s eyes! Sean shakes it off, barely phased.

                    SEAN
              (dry)
          Oh no, not a cork!

          God, Sean, what happened to you?!                     *
          You used to want to help people!                      *

                    SEAN
          Yeah, and you used to have higher                     *
          standards! Things change!                             *

Sean is hit with ICE from Tom’s ice bucket. Tom then throws     *
the actual ice bucket. It bounces off his head.

                    SEAN (CONT'D)
          This is the guy you chose over me?
          He threw a bucket at my head. You                     *
          want to spend your life with him?                     *

Now truly desperate, Tom opens the picnic basket and pegs       *
fruit at Sean’s head: strawberries, oranges, bananas.           *

                    TOM
          We’re still working through some
          issues! And also, fuck you!

Tom NAILS Sean in the head with a coconut. Sean winces and      *
grabs a jug of gasoline and hurls it into Tom and Grace’s       *
boat. It spills all over the deck.

Sean aims a flare gun-- OH SHIT. Tom leaps into Sean’s boat!    *

          Tom!!!

Tom tries to wrestle the flare gun away from Sean. Sean knees
Tom in the stomach and pistol-whips him--

Sean then whips his boat around, steering back towards the
resort. He knows Grace will follow ‘cause he’s got Tom.         *

                    TOM
          NO! GRACE! NO! Forget about me!                       *
          Keep going to the marina!

But Grace follows. The chase is flipped!                        *

                    SEAN
          Love makes us do stupid things...

Tom gets a lucky blow and knocks the flare gun out of Sean’s
hands. It skitters across the deck. Sean dives for it.

Sean turns to aim but sees a parasailing harness fall around    *
his neck like a noose. What the fuck?

Tom sees a SMALL LEVER at the back of the boat and hurls an     *
orange at it -- causing the chute to unfurl into the wind!      *

Sean is yanked up into the air but grabs Tom!

The parachute pops wide open behind the boat, ripping them
both 50 feet into the air--

--dangling helpless as they’re pulled by the driverless,
speeding boat. On a crash course with the resort island.

IN THE PURSUING SPEED BOAT,

Grace can’t believe her eyes:                                   *

The giant parachute is a big yellow smiley-face. Below it       *
Sean dangles, with Tom grabbing onto him.                       *

Grace speeds to catch up with them...                           *

MEANWHILE,

Underneath that incongruous smiley face parachute, Tom grips    *
onto Sean for dear life. No harness. Scared but determined.     *

Tom’s eyes flick down at the water below. If Sean drops him,    *
he’d hit the water like concrete.

                       SEAN (CONT'D)
             Have you noticed that any time you
             try to fix things... you just make
             everything worse for everyone...

                       TOM
             Actually...
                 (we’re waiting for a great
                  comeback)

Tom’s got nothing left. So hurt. So tired.

             you...                                             *

Tom claws on tight to Sean as he sees Grace’s boat pulling      *
beside Sean’s, trying to rescue him. Sean’s boat is a hundred   *
feet from smashing into the rocky coast of the island.
                   Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                 111.


Grace bumps her boat into Sean’s, trying to push it away from    *
its collision course. No dice. She stands on the seat, jams      *
the throttle, and rips the cake knife from her dress.            *

She’ll need it to jump to the other boat. She leaps!!            *

PARASAILING BOAT

--and lands in this boat. Then grabs the controls and steers
them back towards the marina of the next island.

She sees the flaming “Just Married” boat she ditched CAREEN
ASHORE Amanpulo island...

...blasting through the rows of white chairs and crashing
into rocks in an FIERY EXPLOSION.

                    GRACE                                        *
          Not a great omen...

UP IN THE PARACHUTE, Tom saw the explosion too. Then sees
Grace steering them toward the mainland. He’s proud of her...    *
Until he turns and sees that Sean is grinning.

                    SEAN
          There’s my girl...                                     *

Tom follows his gaze and sees Sean’s helicopter flying up
over the treeline. Harriett. Coming after them. Fuck!            *

IN THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER,

Harriett hangs off the side. With wild hair, crazed eyes, and    *
an Uzi strapped to her: she looks scary as hell.                 *

          Drop him, you coward!!                                 *

IN THE PARACHUTE, Tom takes in Harriett.                         *

Tom looks down at Grace in the boat. Unarmed. Helpless.          *

Tom sees the chopper’s menacing shadow appear in the
translucent parachute... Fifty feet above him...

Harriett OPENS FIRE ON GRACE’S BOAT! Her view is obstructed      *
by the parachute, but she hits the fuel tank, spilling oil       *
from the back of the boat.

CLOSE ON Grace, realizing that they are finished.                *

                    GRACE                                        *
          WE’RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT!

Then she smiles a little, looks up at Tom, and says, quietly:

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                               *
          I love you.

Tom locks eyes with Grace-- then looks at down the rope to       *
the boat—- then looks down at the water. He gets an idea and     *
reaches in his pocket to grab... Grace’s hair extensions.        *

                    SEAN                                         *
              (grossed out, confused)                            *
          Is that... loose hair?                                 *

ON GRACE, looking up at Tom, realizing what he’s about to do.    *

                    GRACE                                        *
          You got this!!                                         *

ON TOM, putting the hair extensions over the taut cord...        *

                    TOM                                          *
              (to himself)                                       *
          I got this.                                            *

And lets go of Sean to zip-line down!                            *

He zooms down and STICKS the landing. Like Grace’s superhero     *
landing before. She smiles, impressed and overwhelmed when--     *

BULLETS PIERCE ALL AROUND THEM. Tom grabs a MACHETE and          *
slices through the rope...                                       *

...sending Sean’s parachute hurtling high into the sky...

...right into the blades of the helicopter.

We hear the BLADES CHEW THROUGH SEAN... SNAP THE ROPE and
then CHOKE on the parachute...

Grace dives to shield Tom as--                                   *

THE HELICOPTER VEERS WILDLY, CRASHES INTO THE WATER, AND
EXPLODES!
                      Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)             113.


Tom and Grace lie on the back of the boat in each others’       *
arms. They can’t believe they’re alive.

The engine is kaput, but the boat bobs in the waves...
floating back towards the resort island.


EXT. BEACH - AMANPULO ISLAND - LATER

The parasailing boat sits in the sand like a beached whale...
near the destroyed white rented chairs and the burned
wreckage of the “Just Married” boat. Splatters of oil on the
sand are still burning from the explosion.

Tom hobbles as Grace helps him to the beach.                    *

                    GRACE                                       *
          You really stuck that landing!                        *

                    TOM
          I know! I might have broken my                        *
          ankle though. Maybe both.                             *

                    GRACE                                       *
          Still proud.                                          *

They look at each other for a beat, then:                       *

                    TOM
          So when you said “no” before...

                    GRACE                                       *
          I meant: No, I don’t want to start                    *
          over...                                               *

                      TOM
          Oh. Okay.

Tom is heartbroken for a moment, until he sees Grace pushing    *
her broken body into a kneeling position.

                    GRACE                                       *
          ...I want to keep going.                              *

Tom grins. So in love with this blood-spattered woman.

                    TOM
          The ring’s in my pocket. I mean, if
          you’re going to do it, do it right.

With bloody hands, Tom passes Grace her engagement ring. She    *
holds it up to him.                                             *
                   Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)              114.


                    GRACE                                       *
          Thomas Fowler, will you marry me?                     *

                    TOM                                         *
          Are you sure? You’re not scared?                      *

                    GRACE                                       *
          I’m fucking terrified. And I’m                        *
          absolutely sure. Life is chaotic                      *
          but nothing is easier than loving                     *
          you. And I want to love you every                     *
          day for the rest of my life. It’s                     *
          simple when you really think about                    *
          it.                                                   *

Tom smiles, fighting back tears.                                *

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                              *
          So, you want to do this or what?                      *

                       TOM
          Yes. I do.

Grace slides the diamond ring onto Tom’s finger. Or tries to.   *
It doesn’t fit. They laugh, overwhelmed and delirious.          *

                    GRACE                                       *
          Fine, I’ll wear it.                                   *

Grace smiles as Tom puts the ring on her finger. Again. A       *
tender, quiet moment.                                           *

                    TOM                                         *
          Okay, I have to admit, there is                       *
          something nice about a private                        *
          proposal. No crowds. No pictures.                     *

                    GRACE                                       *
          See, I told you!!                                     *

They kiss and turn toward the horizon just as a SCHOOL OF       *
WHALES crests in the ocean. They watch, astounded.              *

                       GRACE (CONT'D)                           *
          Holy shit!                                            *

                    TOM                                         *
          Is that fucking real?                                 *

                    GRACE                                       *
          Did anyone else see that? Fuck, I                     *
          wish we had a camera!                                 *

They laugh and Grace lies down with Tom.                        *

                    TOM
          How long do you think we can wait
          before we let our families out?

                    GRACE                                       *
          They’re good for ten more minutes.

Grace pushes him back onto the sand gently as they make out.    *
He hikes up her tattered wedding dress as MUSIC SWELLS.


INT. RESORT SPA - LATER                                         *

The wedding guests and resort staff are all intermingling in    *
bathrobes. Many in face masks. Drinking cucumber water.         *

Ricky is giving Jamie a massage. Larry is giving Carol a        *
pedicure. As hostage situations go, this one isn’t bad.         *

Everyone hears the DOOR CREAKING OPEN and see... Tom and        *
Grace silhouetted at the door.                                  *

                    GRACE                                       *
          Hey everybody...

Everyone cheers and rushes them.


EXT. AMANPULO RESORT - SUNSET

Everyone sits on the sand together. Tom and Grace have that     *
blissed out energy of two people who had spontaneous sex
right before hosting a dinner party. They’re calm and smiling
and holding hands as they fill everyone in on what happened.

                    GRACE                                       *
          ...and then the helicopter
          exploded.                                             *

                    CAROL

              (smirking at Tom)                                 *
          Do we?                                                *

          Look like the coast guard’s on the                    *
          way. They must have seen the smoke.

                    TOM
          In the meantime... I really don’t                     *
          want to plan another wedding.

                    MARGE
          Let’s do this thing.

                    TOM                                         *
          I don’t know where our rings are...

                    GRACE                                       *
          I already thought of that. Scotty,
          can you help us out?                                  *

Her soon-to-be nephew Scotty looks up, ready to help.           *


EXT. BEACH - LATER

As the last sliver of sun sits on the horizon and coast guard
boats descend on the island...

Grace and Tom stand under the threshold decorated with wilted   *
flowers. Their clothes are ripped and stained with blood .
She’s still wearing combat boots. They make quite the pair.

Some guests sit in the white rental chairs. Some sit on the
front of the beached parasailing boat. Some in the sand.

Marge officiates but we just hear MUSIC.

The Coast Guard land on the beach. They approach but Jamie      *
turns and holds a finger up. So the Coast Guard Guys watch
the makeshift wedding ceremony, confounded.

Scotty brings something over to Tom and Grace. He opens his     *
palms to reveal: two grenade pins with metal rings.

                    TOM                                         *
          They’re perfect.

They slide them on each other’s fingers and kiss. The guests
clap and so do the confused Coast Guard guys.

Then BANG!! Everyone jolts, scared, but then see-- It’s just    *
Ricky lighting off one final firework.                          *

                    RICKY
          Sorry. I saw there was one last                       *
          firework and I thought it would be                    *
          fun but it absolutely was not. One                    *
          hundred percent my bad.

Carol and Larry carry over what’s left of the wedding cake.
Tom and Grace take a moment to stand back and watch everyone:   *

Ricky and Jamie flirt over handfuls of cake. Grace’s parents     *
have a heart to heart with their bare feet in the sand. Ace
and Marge hold each other, watching the sunset.

                    GRACE                                        *
          I finally get it.

                      TOM
          Get what?

                    GRACE                                        *
          Why you wanted a wedding.

Tom smiles. It means a lot to hear her say that.

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                               *
          It’s perfect. I wouldn’t change a
          thing.

That hangs in the air for a second before--

                    GRACE (CONT'D)                               *
          Well obviously--

             TOM                              GRACE (CONT'D)
Yeah no I know.                   I would change a lot. The
                                  people dying and--             *

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          I know what you mean.

                    GRACE                                        *
          You get me.

                    TOM
          Yeah... I get you.

Grace hugs him. Husband and wife. Til death do they part.        *

FADE TO BLACK.

From the POV of Larry’s Video Camera: We see moments from        *
later in the night after a few (at lot) of drinks.               *

-Ricky gives his speech, Jamie cracks up at every joke.          *
Clearly falling in love.                                         *

-Tom and Darcy have their first dance. It’s a little clunky      *
since Tom’s ankle is likely broken. They laugh through it.       *

-The HOUSE BAND -- with ACE as the lead singer -- plays an      *
American pop song in Filipino. Ace is very good. Tom smiles     *
at Marge, grateful.                                             *

-Carol jumps on stage with the band and sings. The crowd goes   *
WILD. Renee dances in the front like a groupie.                 *

-Jeannie drunkenly makes out with a caterer.                    *

-The MOMS-IN-LAW convince the DADS-IN-LAW to all jump in the    *
pool. They do and immediately regret it since it’s freezing.    *

-The whole wedding party does KARAOKE, all singing parts of     *
the same song. Even Larry puts the camera down and jumps in.    *
