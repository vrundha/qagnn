A STEADY BEEP over a BLACK SCREEN.

CHYRON: This is a true story.

FADE UP to...

A HEART MONITOR. A BRIGHT GREEN LINE bouncing across it.

                        ASHLEY (O.S.)
          MOMMY!

ASHLEY SCHMITT (4), boundless energy, wise beyond her
years, runs into a HOSPITAL ROOM, followed by...

...her dad, ED SCHMITT (30’s), easy-going, rugged good
looks, a guy who showers after work, not before. He’s
dressed in his cleanest short-sleeve button up and a well-
worn JOHN DEERE CAP.

                        ED
          Someone’s excited to meet her baby
          sister.

On the bed is TERESA SCHMITT (30), glowing through her
exhaustion, cradling newborn daughter MICHELLE, less than
an hour old.

                        TERESA
          Ashley, come here sweetie, say hi
          to Michelle.

Ashley climbs onto the bed to get a look at the new baby.

                        TERESA
          Now you’re a big sister, you know
          what that means? It means you
          gotta protect her, keep her safe,
          okay. You promise?

                        ASHLEY
          I promise, mama.

Ed gives Ashley a little squeeze, then leans in, gently
kisses baby Michelle on the forehead.

He takes off his BALLCAP and slips it on her head.

                        ED
          There ya go. She might be tiny,
          but we’ll have her drivin’ a
          backhoe in no time...
               (to Teresa)
          We did good, baby.

                           TERESA
             She’s beautiful, isn’t she?

                           ED
             Like her mama.

Ed grins at Teresa. She grins back. In this moment, the
whole world is theirs.

                            VOICE (O.S.)
             Mr. Schmitt?

As we cut to the person talking, the THE SCENE SUDDENLY
CHANGES.

Still a hospital room, but a DIFFERENT one. NIGHT time.
The room dim, quiet.

A DOCTOR, 40’s, stands in the doorway.

                           DOCTOR
             Mr. Schmitt...?

Ed turns around. 4 years has passed. It might as well be
40. He looks exhausted, ground down by life.

Next to him, Teresa lies in a hospital bed, her skin
colorless, very little life left in her.

                           DOCTOR
                     (delicately)
             Her blood pressure is starting to
             fall... it’ll be any moment now...

Ed nods, understanding.

                           DOCTOR
             We’ll give you some privacy.

She looks at him sympathetically, gestures to the NURSE.
They quietly exit the room so he can say goodbye.

Ed looks down at Teresa. How does he do this? Where does
he even begin?

Finally...

                           ED
             Teresa... I will always love you,
             for all time.

He pulls her hand up to his face to feel her fingers
against his cheek.

             You can rest now, baby. I’ll take
             care of our girls. I promise.

Slowly, the beep of the heart rate monitor falls, giving
way to the SOLID TONE of a flatline.

Ed listens to the tone, the finality of it. It doesn’t
seem real.


EXT. ED’S NEIGHBORHOOD - THAT NIGHT

A blue-collar suburb. Quiet and dark, everyone turned in
for the night.


INT. ED’S TRUCK - SAME

Ed rumbles down the road, his mind a million miles away.


EXT. ED’S HOUSE - SAME

He pulls into his driveway, climbs out, heads up the walk
to his SMALL BRICK ONE-STORY. Modest, but well kept.

He puts the key in the lock, and notices the MAILBOX
tacked to the siding is crooked. He straightens it. It
falls again. Needs a new screw.

He steps into --


INT. ED’S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

His mom and dad wait for him at the dining room table,
BARBARA (60s), salt of the earth, the backbone of the
family, ED SENIOR (60’s), quiet, unflappable.

                          ED
             Hey...

They both get up, rush over to him.

                          BARBARA
             Oh Ed.

Barbara wraps her arms around him. Ed Senior gives him a
hug too, then a hardy shoulder squeeze: Stay strong.

                           ED
             Do the girls know?

Barbara nods.

                           BARBARA
             Helped a little they’ve known it
             was coming... Fell asleep about
             half hour ago.

Ed nods, heading down the hall, into--


INT. ASHLEY AND MICHELLE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Pink walls, two twin beds separated by a nightstand.

He kisses a sleeping Ashley, now 8, on her forehead. Then
crosses the room to check on Michelle, now 4.

There’s an OXYGEN TUBE in her nose, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT
near her bed. Ed adjusts the TUBE, checks the levels on
the machine, then kisses her too.

He gently shuts their door, goes back out to--


INT. ED’S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

He gets a TOOL BOX from the HALL CLOSET, walks out to--


INT. ED’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                           ED
             You’re okay to drive?

He walks past them, opens the front door, begins working
to fix the mailbox. Focused. Quiet.

Barbara watches him, concerned.

                           ED SENIOR
             Yeah, just fine.

Ed Senior puts a hand on her back, gesturing for them to
go, let him be. She gathers up her things.


EXT. GOLDEN NUGGET BAR - NIGHT

A local DIVE. Old neon sign blinking above the door.
                   Revision                              5.


INT. GOLDEN NUGGET BAR - CONTINUOUS

Packed on a Friday night. Construction workers, cowboys,
local drunks. The air thick with cigarette smoke.

At the BAR, SHARON (39), big hoop earrings, too much eye-
make-up, a rough-around-the-edges beauty -- gets ready to
knock back TEQUILA SHOTS with THREE CRAGGY-FACED BIKER
GUYS, and her friend ROSE (late 40’s), African-American,
warm but no-nonsense.

Sharon sprinkles SALT on the back of everyone’s hands,
passes out LEMON WEDGES.

                        SHARON
          You know the drill, lick it drink
          it suck it. One, two, three and
          go!

They all lick the salt, take the shot, suck the lemon.
Their faces pucker in unison.

                        SHARON
               (laughs, slurring)
          You forgot the salt!

                        BIKER GUY
          Aw shit, better do another one.
               (to Bartender)
          5 more.

                        ROSE
          3’s fine. We’re good for a sec.

                        SHARON
          Make it 4. It’s Friday. No fun-
          hatin’ allowed.

Rose gives Sharon a little look: Pace yourself. Sharon
grins, used to Rose’s mothering-friend routine. She leans
in, yelling into her ear over the MUSIC.

                        SHARON
          I’m tryin’a make one of these guys
          look pretty.

                        ROSE
          Honey, there ain’t enough booze in
          this place.

Sharon laughs as she reaches for the next shot. Rose
bites her tongue. Sharon’s a big girl.

CONTINUED:

They knock back another round just as Brooks & Dunn’s
Boot Scootin’ Boogie comes on. Sharon’s face lights up.
This is her jam.

                           SHARON
                      (sings along)
             “OUT IN THE COUNTRY, PAST THE CITY
             LIMITS SIGN--”

She takes Rose by the hands, dancing with her.

Sharon’s a fun drunk, no doubt about it.

Rose can’t help herself. Loosens up a little, joining in.

Sharon climbs onto her chair, then ONTO THE BAR, gestures
for Rose to join. Rose wags her finger. Too far.

The Bikers CHEER as Sharon makes a spectacle, line-
dancing down the bar, stepping over everyone’s beers, an
impromptu performance...

She gets all the way to the end and does a KICK AND SPIN
for a BIG FINISH.

Except, she loses her footing on the turn, SLIPS, TUMBLES
OFF THE EDGE, BUSTING HER HEAD on the back of a barstool.


EXT. SHARON’S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

A tiny sagging pre-fab home.

Sharon’s EYEBROW is busted open, blood dripping through
her eye make-up.

Rose lugs her to the front door. She’s hammered, can
barely walk, practically dead weight.


INT. SHARON’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Rose gets her inside, dumps her onto her couch, pulls her
HIGH HEELS off. Then goes into the kitchen, gets a WET
WASH CLOTH, GLASS of WATER, some ASPIRIN.

Rose dabs the wound with the washcloth, places the WATER
and ASPIRIN on the coffee table.

EXT. LOUISVILLE - MORNING

The blinding sun. Hotter then hell. Everyone’s lawn burnt
to a crisp in the summer heat.


INT. SHARON’S HOUSE - SAME

Light streams through the windows, baking the living room
like an oven.

Sharon peels open an eye. Very weakly lifts a hand to her
head... it’s POUNDING. She feels her insides beginning to
CHURN.

Suddenly, she can feel it: Everything about to come up.

She wills herself to her feet, rushes to--


INT. SHARON’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sharon lunges to the toilet, throws the lid up, hurls the
contents of her stomach.

She flushes, stumbles over to the sink, cranes her head
under the faucet to rinse out her mouth.

Then catches her reflection for the first time: Face
CRUSTED WITH BLOOD, a JAGGED WOUND scabbing above her
eyebrow, mascara everywhere.

A hazy memory of the night returns.

Then with it, a wave of shame. She presses her eyes shut,
embarrassed.


INT. SHARON’S LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Sharon sits in a chair, holding the WATER Rose left for
her.

The room is excruciatingly quiet.

A FEELING comes. It’s one she knows well. An EMPTINESS
forming in the center of her, swallowing the rest of her
into it...

It gets stronger and stronger, until finally, she bursts
to her feet, grabs her CAR KEYS.
                   Revision                              8.


INT. LIQUOR/CONVENIENCE STORE - A LITTLE LATER

Sharon pulls a 6-PACK OF BEER out of the FRIDGE CASE.

RELIEF comes the second it’s in her hands.

She gets in line at the REGISTER. There’s an OLD MAN in
line in front of her, taking forever.

She heaves a sigh, impatient. Glances over at the
NEWPAPER RACK. Perusing the headlines of The NY Times,
The Wall Street Journal.

Then, in the upper left corner of the LOCAL LOUISVILLE
PAPER, something catches her eye--

A PHOTO OF A LITTLE GIRL. Bright sparkling eyes. A sweet,
tiny smile. Something in her face instantly seizes
Sharon’s heart.

Then she reads the headline above her image:

4-YEAR-OLD GIRL LOSES MOTHER, IN FIGHT FOR HER OWN LIFE

She narrows her eyes, leans in, begins to read more.

Michelle Schmitt’s mother, Teresa Schmitt, died late
Thursday evening after battling a rare condition called
Wegener’s disease for several months. Now the family
fears Michelle will be next.

                        CLERK
          Ma’am?

Sharon looks up, sees it’s her turn in line.

But she’s not done reading the article, and something in
her needs to know the rest.

She grabs the PAPER, puts it down on the counter with the
6-pack.


INT. SHARON’S CAR - A LITTLE LATER

Sharon sits in her PARKED CAR. Cracks open a BEER, picks
up the newspaper, keeps reading where she left off.

4-year-old Michelle was recently diagnosed with Biliary
Atresia, a rare medical condition for which there is no
cure. Without a liver transplant, doctors estimate she
has approximately a year to live.

CONTINUED:

Finding a donor for young children is an uncertain
process, with wait times often averaging 2.5 years.

Sharon unfolds the paper and sees TWO MORE PICTURES below
the crease -- The Schmitt family gathered together in
front of a Christmas Tree, and a PHOTO of Teresa laughing
as Michelle puts eyeshadow on her.

At the bottom of the article, an announcement--

Funeral services for Teresa Schmitt will take place at
Hopewell Methodist Church, Saturday Aug 18th, at 2:00pm.

Sharon pauses a moment, realizing that’s today. She
glances at the car’s clock: 1:51pm. Hopewell Church is
not far away.

Suddenly, she feels an impulse to do something completely
out of the ordinary.


EXT. HOPEWELL CHURCH - A LITTLE LATER

GUESTS mill around quietly before the service, hugging
and offering condolences.

Ed makes his way through the sanctuary, holding Michelle
and Ashley by hand. He wears his one rarely-worn suit and
tie.

His body here, but his mind is still far away.

They take a seat in the FIRST PEW next to his parents.
Barbara squeezes his arm. Ed Sr. gives him a little pat.

Michelle climbs on his lap, peering around the church,
looking for something.

                           MICHELLE
                      (whispering)
             Where’s Mommy? Grandma said she’d
             be here.

Ed isn’t sure what to say. Barbara cuts in, pointing to
the casket.

                           BARBARA
             She’s right in there, honey.

Michelle looks at the closed casket, confused.

             But...how can she breathe in
             there.

                           ASHLEY
             You don’t breathe when you die, I
             told you that, dummy.

                           ED
             Ashley, shhh, be nice.

Ashley is dealing with the loss by pretending she’s grown
up, and knows everything her little sister doesn’t.

                           BARBARA
             That’s her body, sweetheart, not
             her soul. Her soul is home with
             God now.

                           MICHELLE
             But why doesn’t God want her home
             with us?

Good question. Ed’s been wondering the same thing.

Barbara isn’t sure how to answer that, decides to go with
a stock platitude.

                           BARBARA
             Well...some things, only He
             understands.

MINISTER THOMAS (60’s) approaches the podium. The
whispering quiets down and everyone faces front.

                           MINISTER THOMAS
             Good afternoon and welcome. Before
             we get started today, I want to
             thank you on the behalf of the
             Schmitt Family for the outpouring
             of love, support, prayers--


EXT. HOPEWELL CHURCH - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Sharon climbs out of her car, holding a SMALL CHEAP
BOUQUET OF FLOWERS she quickly grabbed from the GROCERY
STORE.

She smoothes her clothes a little, still in last night’s
outfit. Not exactly funeral attire: A sparkly BEDAZZLED
JEAN SKIRT and LOW-CUT TOP.

She yanks the skirt as low as it will go, suddenly self-
conscious about how short it is.


INT. HOPEWELL CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

Sharon walks in, sees the service has already started.

She feels a sudden rush of nerves, still not sure what
she’s even doing here.

But pushes past it, tip-toeing into the sanctuary, trying
to be inconspicuous.

The CLICK-CLACK of her HEELS echoes anyway, making
SEVERAL PEOPLE turn around. Some of them eyeball her
attire.

Sharon smiles apologetically, slips into a pew.

                           MINISTER THOMAS
             Today, with the loss of Teresa, we
             feel real heartache. But in times
             like these, the Lord asks us to
             put our faith in Him.

The minister turns his gaze towards Ed.

                           MINISTER THOMAS
             Ed Schmitt has been a man of faith
             all his life...

Heads turn towards Ed. Salt of the earth in every way.

                           MINISTER THOMAS
             Quiet, humble, never making a show
             of it. But here at church every
             Sunday as long as I’ve known him.
             Ed & Teresa, married in this very
             room, their two precious girls
             baptized just steps from where I
             stand... So, let us trust that the
             Lord will see the Schmitt family
             through this difficult time...

Ed pulls in a breath, trying to steady himself.


INT. HOPEWELL CHURCH - RECEPTION ROOM - AFTERNOON

GUESTS file past the FOOD TABLE. Sharon spoons a clump of
HOMEMADE NOODLE SALAD on a paper plate, still feeling out
of place here.

She stands awkwardly by a potted plant, eating it.

She spots Ed and the girls across the room, surrounded by
people offering condolences. Waits for an opening.

When a few people clear, she dumps the noodle salad,
approaches them with the flowers.

                           SHARON
             Uh... hi...I hope I’m not
             intruding.

Ed looks over at Sharon.

                           SHARON
             You don’t know me, I’m Sharon, I
             read about your family in the
             paper and I...I just wanted to
             come by to say, I’m sorry.

                           ED
             Oh. Thank you...

Sharon hands Ed the CHEAP BOUQUET OF FLOWERS.

                           ED
             That’s very nice of you.

Michelle points to Sharon’s skirt, amazed.

                           MICHELLE
             Your skirt sparkles!

                           SHARON
             Oh. Uh...

She laughs, a little embarrassed to have attention called
to it.

                           MICHELLE
             I wish my dress sparkled. Look how
             it spins!

Michelle TWIRLS, showing her how the dress catches the
air and puffs like a balloon. Sharon grins.

                           SHARON
             Wow!

                           ED

          I’m 4 years old almost 5!

                         SHARON
          Wow!
                 (to Ashley)
          And you’re...let me guess... about
          12?

                       ASHLEY
                (shocked, flattered)
          I’m only 8!

                         SHARON
          Only 8?!

Sharon plays up her surprise. Ashley instantly loosens,
liking this lady.

Barbara cuts in.

                        BARBARA
          Ed...Teresas’ Great Aunt and Uncle
          want just a minute with you.

Barbara gestures towards AUNT LOIS & UNCLE AL (80’s), her
with pillow white hair, him in suspenders.

                        BARBARA
                    (to Sharon)
          Sorry to interrupt. I don’t think
          we’ve met, were you a friend of
          Teresa’s?

                        SHARON
          Oh, no. I...just sort of...
          wandered in off the street...

Sharon laughs at the absurdity of the truth. Barbara gets
a load of her, isn’t sure how she feels about someone
funeral-crashing her daughter-in-law’s service.

                         BARBARA
          Ah...huh.

Sharon senses the weirdness. Clears her throat.

                        SHARON
          Well... I should shove off now,
          but I’ll be thinking of y’all...

Barbara smiles politely, waves goodbye. Sharon makes her
way to the exit.

MEANWHILE--

AUNT LOIS has her hand on Ed’s arm--

                        LOIS
          Faith the size of a mustard seed.
          That’s all you need, son.

She pats him reassuringly, then UNCLE AL steps up,
hugging him.

                        UNCLE AL
          We put Michelle on the prayer list
          at our church in Arlington. We
          know Jesus will get you and them
          girls through.

Ed nods and smiles, a rote routine now. More RELATIVES
gather, a whole line of them.

                        ANOTHER RELATIVE
          We keep praying for little
          Michelle and know God is--

Ed begins to TUNE OUT COMPLETELY, politely nodding and
smiling, but hearing absolutely nothing.


INT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Sharon walks to her car, still a bit weirded-out by her
decision to come here on the fly.

She follows behind TWO WOMEN, talking on their way to
their own car.

                        WOMAN 1
          I don’t know how he’s doing it.

                        WOMAN 2
          You’re tellin’ me.

                        WOMAN 1
          The grief is enough, but then all
          those hospital bills too, and no
          insurance...

                        WOMAN 2
          I thought the church helped him
          out...?

             They did. Emptied the till. Bunch
             of friends and family went broke
             helping out too... But now
             Michelle’s surgery is another
             200,000 at least...if she can even
             get it.

                           WOMAN 2
             How’s anybody supposed to come up
             with money like that?

                           WOMAN 1
             Gonna take a miracle.

                           WOMAN 2
                  (shakes her head)
             200,000 miracles...

The women break off to get in their car. Sharon pauses
for a moment before she gets into her own car, thinking.


INT. ED'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

The house is quiet. The kids in bed. The FAINT BUZZ of
the TV in the living room where Ed Senior watches an old
episode of MASH. Barbara washes dishes at the sink,
glances out the window at Ed, sitting alone on the back
steps, smoking a cigarette.


EXT. ED'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

Ed stares into the darkness, thinking.

Behind him, the screen door swings open. Barbara steps
out onto the porch, taking a seat next to him.

                          BARBARA
             Mind?

He shakes his head. They both stare into the darkness.

Ed takes another drag off his cigarette. Barbara watches
the smoke exit his lungs into the warm night air.

                           BARBARA
             I really wish you wouldn’t
             smoke...

Ed looks at her.

             I know. This isn’t the time to get
             on your case about it, but those
             girls are gonna need their dad
             around, Ed...

                           ED
             Ma...

                           BARBARA
             See ‘em graduate, walk ‘em down
             the aisle. And you gotta be in
             good shape if you’re gonna live
             that long.

                           ED
             I know, Ma.

                           BARBARA
             You’re already 42 and you’re--

                           ED
             Okay, I get it, Ma, enough!

Barbara stops abruptly. Ed closes his eyes, heaves a
sigh, feeling bad for raising his voice.

                           ED
             Sorry... I’m sorry. You’re right.
             You’re right, I just...gotta have
             a break sometimes.

Beat.

                           BARBARA
             You’re a good man, Ed. Ever since
             you were little, always tried to
             do the right things.

He isn’t sure what to say to that. Barbara looks off,
recalling a memory.

                           BARBARA
             I’ll never forget when you were 6
             and we’d gone out to Myrtle beach,
             spent the weekend so you could see
             the ocean. On the car ride back,
             you realized you accidentally took
             another boy’s sand toy with us...
             You felt so bad. Wouldn’t rest
             until we turned around and drove
             all the back to give it to him...

She looks at her son. Of all people, he doesn’t deserve
this.

Ed shakes his head, wrestling with something inside
himself.

                        ED
          I don’t know...

                        BARBARA
          You don’t know what...

                        ED
          Any of it... What any of it
          matters...

There’s a long silence between them. Barbara can tell how
much is weighing on him. She offers carefully--

                        BARBARA
          I talked with Pa last night... I
          think you and the kids should move
          in with us. We’ll make it
          comfortable for you, it’ll be
          tight, but we can make it work.
          Get this mortgage off your back,
          free up your paycheck to save for
          Michelle...

                        ED
          I don’t wanna sell the house.

                        BARBARA
          I know you don’t.

                        ED
          Teresa worked so hard on this
          house. To make it nice for the
          girls.

Ed looks around their backyard at the tiny SECOND HAND
SWING-SET, the LITTLE PLASTIC SWIMMING POOL Teresa found.

                        ED
          I don’t want to take that away
          from them, the only thing they
          have left of their mom. I don’t
          know how to hang on to it, but
          I’ve gotta find a way...

Barbara nods, understanding.

INT. INCH BY INCH HAIR SALON - DAY

A small shop jointly owned by Sharon and Rose. They’re
the only two hairdressers, plus an ASSISTANT in training,
JASON (20’s), a sweet latino kid with a mohawk.

Sharon and Rose talk while Rose’s client sits under the
dryer, and Sharon waits on her next haircut to arrive.

                        SHARON
          I don’t know what came over me,
          but when I saw that little girl’s
          picture, something inside me said,
          you have to go there.

                        ROSE
          To a lady-you’ve-never-met’s
          funeral.

                        SHARON
          I know it sounds crazy. The whole
          time I was there, I kept thinkin’,
          why the hell am I doing this, this
          is nuts.

Rose nods, agreeing completely.

                        SHARON
          But then, I’m walking back to my
          car, and I overhear these ladies
          talking--

                         ROSE
          Uh huh--

                        SHARON
          --and I hear them say the family’s
          gone broke paying all these
          hospital bills, and now they gotta
          come up with another two hundred
          thousand for Michelle’s transplant
          too--

          --and that’s when it hit me.

             You’ve got 200,000 dollars lying
             around, and I’m buying your ass

             Get 200,000 dollars. Just get it.

                           SHARON
             Listen, I know how it sounds--

                           ROSE
             Like you knocked a few screws
             loose when you bumped your head
             the other night.

                           SHARON
             I know, but I’m dead serious,
             Rose. I think I’m meant to help
             that little girl. And also...
                  (meaning this)
             I’m gonna stop drinkin’.

Rose looks at her to see if she’s for real. Hopes she is.

                           ROSE
             Well the stoppin’-drinkin’ I can
             get behind.

                           SHARON
             I know. I’ve needed to. I can’t
             keep going on like this...

Rose can tell Sharon’s serious. Wants to encourage it.

     She doesn’t think she’ll pull it off, but--

     Rose goes to the DRYER to check her client’s color. The
     door CHIMES, Sharon’s next haircut walking in.


     EXT. WOODBRIDGE HOUSE, UPPER CLASS SUBURB - DAY

28   A PRETTY TWO-STORY HOME with a wide manicured lawn, and      28
     beautiful landscaping.

     Ed works out front, digging a LONG SHALLOW TRENCH in the
     grass, sweating in the blistering heat, losing himself in
     the hard labor.

     LATER -- Ed is on his hands and knees, piecing together
     pipes for a NEW SPRINKLER SYSTEM.

     LATER-- Ed lays NEW SOD where he dug up the grass.

     LATER-- Ed, caked in dirt and dried sweat, accepts a
     CHECK from the HOMEOWNER (50’s), wealthy, crisp golf
     shirt.

     Ed nods gratefully, slips the check into his wallet as he
     heads down to truck.

     Just as he’s about to climb in, THREE HUGE CONSTRUCTION
     TRUCKS rumble past, kicking up a cloud of ROAD DUST. Ed
     shields his face, trying not to breathe it in.

INT. ED’S TRUCK - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Ed drives home. With the day’s work done, reality
returns, and again his thoughts begin to churn.

He turns onto THE MAIN HIGHWAY, and sees he is BEHIND THE
BIG CONSTRUCTION TRUCKS. They’re going 15 mph.

He drums the steering wheel, impatient.

Finally, they all TURN LEFT into a CONSTRUCTION ZONE.

It’s the beginning of a NEW TRACT HOME DEVELOPMENT.

He doesn’t think much of it, keeps driving. Then, a few
seconds later... an IDEA comes.

The wheels in his head turn.

Suddenly, he punches the breaks, flips a U-turn, goes
back to the construction site.

He pulls up, takes a look at the BANNER strung up on the
chain-link fence: Soon-to-be GORGEOUS HOMES with BIG
BEAUTIFUL YARDS.

It’s all mostly still DIRT, the new foundations being
poured.


INT. ED’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

Michelle and Ashley are watching TV. Barbara enters with
a SYRINGE.

                        BARBARA
          Alright, here we go, brave girl.
          Just the tiniest bee-sting.

Michelle holds out her arm, knowing the drill.

               (readying the shot)
          Real quick, 1-2-3.

Barbara administers it as quick as she can. Michelle
sucks in her breath. It hurts.

                         MICHELLE
          Ehhhhhh.

She fights back tears, trying to be brave.

herself from crying.

             Goooood. So brave! Toughest girl

Michelle is getting.

             help me set the table. Dinner’s

             stuff.


INT. ED'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Barbara carries a HOT CASSEROLE and BASKET OF DINNER
ROLLS to the table just as Ed walks through the door from
work. Ed Senior and the girls just taking their seats.

             Perfect timing...

Ed enters, puts down his stuff.

                           ED
             Hey. Sorry I’m late. I’ll shower
             quick.

                           BARBARA
             No, just eat while it’s hot, we
             don’t mind, do we?

Ed senior waves off the need for any manners. Ed goes to
the kitchen, washing his hands and face in the sink.

Ashley notices something on the TV in the other room.

             Oh yeah! Can we? Please!

Barbara looks at Ed to make the decision. He dries his
face with a dish towel.

                            ED
             Go ‘head.

They hurry and take their plates into the other room.
Barbara serves Ed up some food.

                           ED
             Looks delicious, Ma.

She notices his mood is a tad brighter.

                           BARBARA
             Good day at work?

Ed takes the plate from her, sits down.

                           ED
             I think I figured something out...

                            BARBARA
             Oh yeah?

                            ED SENIOR
             What’s that?

                           ED
             A way to keep the house.

Ed and Barbara exchange a look, hopeful.

                           ED
             That new development off
             Ridgeline, those new homes they’re
             building.

                           ED SENIOR
             I read about those. Big homes,
             real big.

                           ED
             Yeah, big homes with big yards...
             that somebody’s gonna have to put
             in.

They see what he’s thinking.

          could somehow get that contract.
          Hire a crew, manage them. Be set
          for a year...

They all brighten at the possibility.

                        BARBARA
          They’d be lucky to have you.

                        ED SENIOR
          Ain’t nobody better.

                        ED
          Well...let’s see.

Ed feels the tug of hope after going a long time without
it. This could actually work.


EXT. SHARON’S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

Establishing.


INT. SHARON’S HOUSE / VARIOUS - SAME

Sharon empties a bottle of VODKA into the SINK. Tosses
the empty container in her kitchen trash can. Unscrews
another bottle, begins emptying it.

MONTAGE: Sharon vacuums, dusts, cleans the bathroom, puts
a pair of clean sheets on her bed, drags the TRASH to the
curb.

She stands in her doorway a moment, taking it in. The
house is fresh and clean, a launch pad for a new life.


INT. SHARON’S BEDROOM - LATER

Sharon sits up in bed, staring at Michelle’s PHOTO in the
paper, trying to come up with a plan.

She has a LEGAL PAD in front of her, ready to write down
ideas. Except... she has none. She drums the pencil on
the paper, trying to think.

She looks at the time. Midnight already. Decides to put
it to rest for tonight.

CONTINUED:

She turns off the light, snuggles into bed, flips on her
TV in search of a show to lull her to sleep.

She flips through channels, stops on WAYNE NEWTON singing
on TV. She watches a moment. As he finishes the act,
JERRY LEWIS joins him on stage. It’s the Jerry Lewis
Telethon for Muscular Dystrophy...

She sits up a little, thinking.


INT. INCH BY INCH HAIR SALON - DAY

Sharon bursts into the salon.

                          SHARON
             I got it!

Rose startles, looks over from where she’s giving a GUY A
SHAVE.

                           ROSE
             Jesus. I almost took his nose off.

The guy looks up at Rose, unnerved.

                           ROSE
             Would’ve given you a discount...

                           SHARON
             Look. Check this out.

Sharon pulls a rolled up BANNER out of her bag, unfurls
it to reveal a GIANT POSTER advertising a 24-HOUR HAIR-A-
THON.

                           ROSE
             A hair-a-thon?

Sharon points to the PHOTO of MICHELLE she’s blown-up and
pasted all over the banner.

                           SHARON
             For 24 hours, the money from every
             haircut and color we do, we donate
             to Michelle. I mean, I know it
             won’t be anywhere close to 200
             thousand, but it’s something, and
             every little bit helps. What do
             you say, will you do it?

Rose is staring at Michelle’s photo, transfixed.

                           SHARON
             Isn’t she something?

Rose clutches her heart, too many feelings.

                           ROSE
             I’m usually so cold-blooded...

                           SHARON
             So you’re in then.

                           ROSE
             In? Look at her face, I wanna give
             her my own damn liver!
                    (then)
             Wait... can I?

                           SHARON
             Nope, already looked into that.

Sharon holds up some FLIERS.

                           SHARON
             Thanks, Rose. I’m gonna go canvas
             the place.


INT. ED’S BATHROOM - DAY

Ed buttons up a DRESS SHIRT, tucks it into some khaki
pants, trying to look professional. He’s a blue jeans
guy, and feels a little like he’s wearing a costume.

Michelle comes bounding in.

                           MICHELLE
             You wanna play with me?

                           ED
             Ah, I’d love to. I’ve gotta run
             out for a bit.

He picks her up in his arms. She gets a whiff of him.

                           MICHELLE
             What smells so good.

                           ED
             Called aftershave.

             Oooh can I have some?

He laughs. Then notices something. Her eyes. They have
the slightest yellow tint. He sets her down, gets a
closer look.

                           ED
             You feeling okay? You look a
             little...

                           MICHELLE
             Funny? It’s ‘cause I’m a
             butterfly!

She flaps her arms, runs into the other room, pretending
to fly.

                           MICHELLE
             I’m a butterflllyyyyy!

She seems fine, he’s just worrying.


EXT. NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - A LITTLE LATER

A few MEN IN HARDHATS look at BLUEPRINTS, CONSTRUCTION
WORKERS beginning the FRAMING.

Behind them, Ed’s truck pulls into the lot, comes to a
stop near TWO TRAILERS. He climbs out, smiles warmly at
the hard-hats.

                           ED
             Hey there... Say, is there a site
             manager around I might speak to?

                           HARD HAT GUY
             Right in there.

He points Ed towards one of the TRAILERS.

                           ED
             Thanks.

Ed heads up the trailer’s metal steps, opens the door
into--
                      Revision                       28.


INT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

Ed finds the construction site manager, BOB GREEN (50’s),
heavy-set, weather-beaten face, behind a desk stacked
with paperwork.

                          ED
          Hello...

                          BOB GREEN
          Hello?

                        ED
          Heard you’re the site manager?

                        BOB GREEN
          Heard right. Can I help you?

Ed takes a few steps towards him.

                        ED
          My name’s Ed Schmitt, with Schmitt
          Landscaping. I just came by to
          introduce myself... We do
          landscaping, hardscaping, pretty
          much anything outside the house.
          I was wondering if you folks had a
          company yet?

Bob looks him over.

                        BOB GREEN
          Good timing, actually.

Ed loosens a bit.

                          ED
          Great.

                        BOB GREEN
          Yeah, I’m putting together a few
          options for the investors to look
          at next week. Get me your stuff
          and we’ll take a look.

Ed unfolds a small piece of paper, on which he’s neatly
written several names and phone numbers.

                        ED
          I brought my references if you
          want that now.

             Photos of your work and what not.

Ed nods. He has nothing that fancy.

             Get it to me no later than next
             Friday so I make sure you’re in

Sharon pins a flier to a BULLETIN BOARD, exits --


EXT. LOUISVILLE COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

She tacks another to the TELEPHONE POLE, puts several
more under WINDSHIELD WIPERS of PARKED CARS.

She rounds a corner, about to go into a NAIL SALON, when
she suddenly slows her steps, something across the street
catching her eye:

A CEMETERY.

She hovers there a beat, staring at it.

She looks through the cemetery gates, at a spot in the
distance between two trees. Swallows.

Then turns, and goes into the nail salon.


EXT. ED’S HOUSE - NIGHT

A half-moon floats over Ed’s house.


INT.   ASHLEY AND MICHELLE’S BEDROOM - SAME

Ed sits on floor between the girls’ beds, reading to
them.

           Goodnight stars. Goodnight air.
           Goodnight noises everywhere.

Ashley is konked out too. He closes the book, gets up,
giving them each a kiss.


INT. ED’S HALLWAY - LATER

Ed gently shuts their door.


INT. ED’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Sitting at the dining room table, Ed opens the THICK

prices for different items.


INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - A LITTLE LATER

Ed sits at a PUBLIC COMPUTER, TYPING UP his itemized bid
and proposed schedule. He flips through a LEGAL PAD where
he’s written notes. It’s filled up to the very last page.


INT. INCH BY INCH HAIR SALON - MORNING

The place has been transformed. There are multi-colored
streamers, pictures of Michelle, bobbing balloons
attached to a donation jar.

Sharon and Rose set up a coffee station with cookies,
donuts, etc.

                           SHARON
             God I hope people show up.

                           ROSE
             Don’t worry, I got 42 cousins on
             my mama’s side alone. I called all
             of ‘em.

Sharon flips the OPEN SIGN over on the door, props it
open, glances out front. The sidewalk is empty both
directions.

A MAN comes jogging towards.

                           SHARON
             Hi! Our first hair-a-thon
             customer!

out for a jog.

INT. ED’S TRUCK - A LITTLE LATER

Ed pulls up outside a PRETTY HOME, grabs the CAMERA off
his passenger seat, climbs out to shoot some photos.

Just then, a BIG GROUP OF ROSE’s FAMILY - sisters,
brothers, cousins - comes walking in.

ROSE’S COUSIN MARCUS (40’s), a big teddy bear of a guy,
plops himself down in her chair.

          Where’s your sister?

Ashley shrugs.

                        BARBARA
          Michelle?

Barbara goes into the girls room, finds Michelle sitting
on the carpet, staring into nowhere, in a fog.

          Michelle... Are you okay?

She nods, but looks very tired.


EXT. INCH BY INCH SALON - LATER

A CITY BUS wheezes to a stop, MRS. ALLEN (80’s) climbs
out with the help of her NURSE CAREGIVER (30’s)

She notices a LARGE LINE forming outside the salon,
popping with customers now.

             us.

Mrs. Allen looks over at their assistant Jason, whose
folding hair foils.

                           MRS. ALLEN
             What about him?

                           SHARON
             Oh, he’s still in training.

                           MRS. ALLEN
             How long you been training?

                             JASON
             Few months...

                           MRS. ALLEN
             Good enough. We’ll each take a
             haircut.
                  (to caregiver)
             Give me my wallet.

                           CAREGIVER
             Uh...Mrs. Allen, I really don’t
             know if--

                           MRS. ALLEN
             Shush, it’s for a good cause.

The caregiver can’t protest.

                           CAREGIVER
             Maybe just a tiny trim...

Jason looks a little nervous to be thrown in the deep
end. Mrs. Allen plops down in the chair.

                        MRS. ALLEN
          And I want what you’ve got.

She points to his rainbow mohawk.

                        CAREGIVER
          Ha ha ha... your son would kill
          me.
                 (to Jason)
          Obviously she’s kidding.

                        MRS. ALLEN
               (To Jason, dead
                serious)
          Do I look like I’m kidding?

Jason raises an eyebrow. Okay then. This is happening.


EXT. ED’S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

The sun is going down. Ed pulls into the driveway, the
camera and half a dozen ROLLS OF SHOT FILM on the
passenger seat.

He cuts the engine. Ed Senior rushes out the front door
to meet him, a concerned look on his face.

                        ED
          What’s going on?

                        ED SENIOR
          It’s Michelle. Something’s off.

Ed hurries towards the house.


INT. ED’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ed rushes down the hallway, into--


INT. THE GIRLS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Michelle lies on her bed now, limp, Barbara kneeling next
to her.

                        BARBARA
          She just got so tired suddenly.

Ed kneels down, looks into Michelle’s eyes. They look
even more yellow than they did the other day.

He makes a quick decision, picking her up in his arms.

                           ED
             I’m taking her to the hospital.

Barbara gets up, worried. They follow after him through
the house.

                           ED SENIOR
             You want us to follow you?

                           ED
             No, you and Ma stay with Ashley.

Ashley suddenly looks very worried for her little sister,
the “grown-up” act gone. Barbara sees her distress, hugs
her.

                           BARBARA
             It’s alright, honey.


EXT. ED’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Ed hurries to open the passenger door to load Michelle in
the car. But the CAMERA and ROLLS OF FILM are on the
seat. He grabs them up with one hand, moves them the BED
OF HIS TRUCK, then slides her in.

Barbara watches anxiously from the porch.

                            BARBARA
             Call us.

                            ED
             I will.


INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DUSK

Ed rushes through the EMERGENCY DOORS, carrying Michelle
up to the admitting desk.


INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL PATIENT ROOM - DUSK

MEDICAL PERSONNEL check Michelle’s vital signs, insert an
I.V, try to get a read on things.
                   Revision                             37.


INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - EVENING

Ed is at a BANK OF PAY PHONES.

                        ED
          She needed another blood
          transfusion. They are giving it to
          her now.

                        BARBARA
          Lord have mercy...

Then, hating what he has to say next...

                        ED
          She’s getting worse faster than
          they thought... They’re moving her
          up to 6 on the transplant list.

Barbara sinks at this news. Then, trying to find a ray of
light somewhere in it--

                        BARBARA
          Number 6... well that’s some good
          news, right? Means we’ll get a
          donor faster...

Ed can’t see the bright side right now. Answers simply--

                        ED
          I’ve gotta go, Ma.


INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL / BILLING DESK - LATER

Michelle plays with a STUFFED ANIMAL the children’s ward
gave to her, her energy coming back.

Ed stands at the BILLING DESK, talking to the CLERK.

                        BILLING CLERK
          Insurance card?

                        ED
          No.

                        BILLING CLERK
          No heath insurance?

Ed shakes his head. That’s correct. The Clerk makes a
face indicating this will be painful then.

Ed takes the punch. Swallows it. Takes out his DEBIT
CARD, praying he has enough in the account.


INT. INCH BY INCH SALON - NIGHT

Sharon and Rose eat take-out Chinese food in the back of
the CLOSED SALON, counting the CASH from the event.

                           SHARON
             Over $3,000...

                           ROSE
             Damn. That’s a lotta haircuts.

They high-five.

                           SHARON
             I’d say let’s get a drink to
             celebrate, but...

Rose nods. Yeah, probably not a great idea.

                           ROSE
             I got another idea...

Sharon raises an eyebrow.


EXT. STRIP MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Sharon and Rose clink together TWO MASSIVE ICE-CREAM
CONES.

                           ROSE
             Cheers.

                           SHARON
             Cheers.

They’re sitting on the hood of Sharon’s car, looking at
the city lights.

                           SHARON
             I’m trading drunk for fat.

                           ROSE
             Ain’t a bad place to live, honey.

                           SHARON
             Hey that ain’t fat, it’s curves.

                           ROSE
             Tomato, tomahto. Just don’t make
             me eat neither!

They laugh, grin at each other. Then Rose’s expression
changes.

                          ROSE
             Hey...

                          SHARON
             Yeah?

                           ROSE
             You wanna know something?

Rose pauses a sec, then, very honestly--

                           ROSE
             I was about give up on you.

Sharon cocks her head, not sure what she means exactly.

                           ROSE
             The way you were headed... I was
             this close to telling you, I just
             can’t do it anymore. Was even
             thinking about selling my half of
             the shop...

Sharon realizes just how bad she’d gotten. Doesn’t know
what to say.

                           SHARON
                   (exhales)

Sharon smiles. She likes this Sharon too.

             Promise me you’ll hang onto her?

EXT. LOUISVILLE - DAY

The hottest day yet. Tar in the asphalt bubbles.


EXT. ED’S BACKYARD - SAME

The girls splash in their PLASTIC SWIMMING POOL, playing
with the hose. Barbara watches them from the porch,
sitting in front of an OSCILLATING FAN. Opens the neck of
her shirt so the air blows down her sweating chest.


INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

Ed, dirty and sunburned from today’s landscaping job,
pushes a shopping cart down the FROZEN FOOD AISLE,
looking at a SMALL HANDWRITTEN LIST OF ITEMS.

AT THE REGISTER --

The CASHIER finishing ringing him up.

                        CASHIER
          That’ll be $71.63

Ed hands her his DEBIT CARD. She swipes it. The machine
makes a LOW BUZZ. DECLINED.

                        CASHIER
          Uh...it didn’t go through.

Ed freezes, remembering the ER bill. He might not have
enough money in his account.

                        ED
               (putting back the
                cigarettes)
          I don’t actually need these.

She replaces them on the shelf behind her, subtracts the
money.

                        CASHIER
          Alrighty. That’ll be $65.16. Swipe
          it agin?

He nods. She swipes it again. The machine BUZZES again.
Ed starts to sweat.

He randomly grabs SEVERAL ITEMS, shoving them aside to be
put back. The PEOPLE in line start to watch.

                           ED
             Try it again without those.

The cashier starts to get as nervous as he is, hoping for
his sake it goes through.

She quickly subtracts the items. Ed waits with held
breath as she tries the card again. The machine CHIMES.

                           CASHIER
                  (eyes brightening)
             Ahh. There we go.


EXT. ED’S HOUSE - EVENING

Ed unloads the groceries from the bed of his truck, still
steeping in the humiliation.

Then he notices something in the truck bed: The CAMERA
and FILM ROLLS he put in there when he took Michelle to
the hospital.

He reaches in to get them, sees: The FILM ROLLS have
melted and warped in the day’s broiling heat. All the
photos he took, ruined.

He tosses down the roll, pissed.

                           ED
             Dammit!

He slams the tailgate shut, picks up the groceries,
storms up the driveway.

Right before he gets to the door, he stops, realizing he
can’t take his bad mood inside to the girls.

He slowly draws in a breath, trying to get himself to
calm down.


INT. ED’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ed walks in. The girls are still in their swim suits,
doing a puzzle on the floor.

             You look a whole lot better. You
             two good for Grammy today?

                           ASHLEY
             She wasn’t, but I was.

Barbara comes in from the kitchen.

                           BARBARA
             They were both angels. Except one
             of the angels found her mama’s
             nail polish...

Ed now notices Michelle’s hands, face, and swim suit are
covered in HOT PINK NAIL POLISH. She grins, proud.

Barbara takes some of the groceries from Ed, carrying
them into the kitchen.

                           BARBARA
             Dinner’s almost ready, just need
             to make the noodles you got...
             Pa’s got the late shift at the
             hardware-store tonight, won’t be
             home to eat...

             Where are they?

             The noodles. The egg noodles.
             They’re not here, they were on the

Ed suddenly remembers that was an item he put back.

                           ED
             Oh...uh, I guess I forgot...

She points to the BEEFY GRAVY ready on the stove.

          I’m sure we can still eat it.

hating himself for losing his cool.

          Goddammit.

He stalks off to his bedroom to calm down for a second.

situation.

unflappable faith getting to him. Stirring up all of his
anger. Finally, he can’t hold it in.

His eyes are locked with hers, finally speaking all the
things he’s been keeping in.

                           ED
             And now they’ve got Michelle on
             all those same lists... and
             everybody keeps actin’ like that’s
             supposed to make me feel better.
             Really? I mean, really?

He laughs darkly at the absurdity of it.

                           ED
             Maybe hadn’t none of this ever
             happened, I’d be saying the same
             thing to some other poor soul. Oh
             we’re praying for you, we’re
             trusting in the Lord to make it
             alright...
             Well that’s all a nice and fine,
             but the only thing I give a damn
             about right now? This.

He opens his arms, indicating the actual reality they’re
living in.

                           ED
             What’s right here where I can see
             it. The rest... all due respect,
             I don’t got time for anymore.

Barbara sees very clearly where he’s at.

There’s a LITTLE KNOCK on the bedroom door.

                            ASHLEY (O.S.)
             Daddy...

                           ED
             Yes sweetie, we’re coming right
             out.

She cracks the door, poking her head in.

                           ASHLEY
             The lady from mama’s funeral is at
             the door.

                           ED
             What lady from mama’s funeral?

          The sparkly-rainbow lady!

Ed and Barbara exchange a look, no idea who the girls are
talking about.


INT. ED’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ed opens the door, Barbara behind him. They find Sharon
at the threshold.

                        ED
          Hi...

                        SHARON
          Is this a bad time? Didn’t have
          your phone number, hope I’m not
          buggin’ you...

                        ED
          No, it’s alright.

                        SHARON
          Won’t stay long, just came by to
          give ya’ll this.

She hands him a THICK ENVELOPE. He takes it, not sure
what this is.

                        SHARON
          So, uh, my friend and I own a hair
          salon over in Russell. We had a
          thing a couple days ago to raise
          money for your daughter... That’s
          $3,051. I know it’s not a much in
          the overall scheme of things. But,
          I hope it helps...

Ed is speechless. So is Barbara.

                        ED
          Wow... I...

He doesn’t know what to say.

                        BARBARA
          Bless you. What was your name
          again?

                        SHARON
          Sharon. Sharon Stevens.

                           SHARON
             Oh, I don’t want to intrude...

                           BARBARA
             Please, it’s no intrusion.

Barbara pulls her inside.

                             SHARON
             Oh... well...

                           BARBARA
             Come in. Come in. I made
             stroganoff. Except with... who
             knows, rice maybe, if we got it.

Barbara smiles at Ed over her shoulder: How’s that for
god “making a way”?


INT. ED’S LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

They sit around the table, eating stroganoff next to a
PILE OF MAC N CHEESE.

                           BARBARA
             Did you get enough to eat?

                           SHARON
             Oh plenty, thanks. Nice place you
             have here. Real cozy.

Ed looks around at all Teresa’s touches.

                           ED
             Thanks... my wife.

                           MICHELLE
             Excuse me, Miss Sharon?

                           SHARON
             Why yes Miss Excellent Manners?

                           MICHELLE
             Can I please have your sparkle
             skirt?

Sharon laughs. Ed shakes his head.

             Michelle, you can’t just ask
             people to give you their stuff.

                           SHARON
             That skirt sure made a splash.
             Tell you what, sugar. I’ll do you
             one better. I’ll make you your
             very own sparkle skirt in your
             very your size, and it’ll spin
             real big too, how ‘bout that?

Michelle beams, loving that idea. Sharon looks over at
Ashley.

                           SHARON
             And for you... I’m gonna make a
             real elegant purse. ‘Cause every
             lady needs herself a sharp uptown
             handbag for special occasions.

Ashley grins, liking that idea too.

                           ASHLEY
             I could put my chapsticks in it.

                           SHARON
             Yep, and a little mirror, so you
             can see when you’re puttin’ it on.

Ed can’t help but notice how great Sharon is with the
girls.


EXT. ED’S HOUSE - LATER

Barbara and Ed walk Sharon to her car.

                           BARBARA
             Thanks again. Your timing...well,
             it couldn’t have been better.

Ed has to admit the same.

                           ED
             Been a bit of rough patch.

                            SHARON
             Oh yeah?

                           ED
             Had a scare with Michelle. The

             make...

                           SHARON
             What kind of portfolio?

                           ED
             For a job I’m trying to get. I do
             landscaping and they need photos
             of my work and all.

                           SHARON
             Ah. Well... if you need it, I got
             an old Nikon lying around, takes
             real pretty pictures...

Ed cocks his head. Actually.


EXT. LOUISVILLE - MORNING

A pretty day. The heat is finally starting to let up.


EXT. SHARON’S HOUSE - DAY

Ed idles in his truck out front. Sharon jogs to the curb,
carrying the NIKON. She hands it to him through the
window.

                             SHARON
             Here she is.

                             ED
             Thanks again.

It’s an old camera, with lots of buttons and gears.

                             ED
             Fancy...

                           SHARON
             It was my mama’s, she saved up a
             long time for it. It was just us
             two, so there are more photos of
             little me than anybody’d ever want
             to see... You ever used one like
             this?

                             ED
             No.

             You’re gonna rack focus here, hold
             this down for your light-meter to
             see what exposure you need...

Ed looks a little overwhelmed by it. Sharon notices.

                           SHARON
             I could come shoot a few with you
             if you want, show you how to use
             it?

             Oh... well, I mean, if you’re not
             doing anything...

Sharon shakes her head, hops in the truck.


EXT. PRETTY UPPERCRUST HOUSE - LATER

Sharon and Ed walk up to a BEAUTIFUL HOME with gorgeous
gardens.

                           SHARON
             Wow. All that prettiness thanks to
             you, huh?

                           ED
             Well the plants do most of the
             work...

Sharon snaps a few photos. The OWNER of the house waves
from the porch.

                           HOMEOWNER
             Fingers crossed for ya Ed.

                           ED
             Thanks a lot, Gil.

                           SHARON
             These’ll be gorgeous. You should
             take this sucker home for a while,
             get some good ones of the girls.
             Goes fast at that age.

                           ED
             Oh do you have kids?

                  (then)
             On to the next house?

Ed nods.


EXT. LOUISVILLE - EVENING

The sky is purple and gray, the street lights coming on.


INT. ED’S HOUSE -    LATER THAT NIGHT

Ed flips through a PHOTOBOOK where all the pictures have
now been developed, and neatly organized into clear
plastic pockets.

                           ED SENIOR
             Real nice, son. Looks real
             professional.

                           ED
             Sharon took all of ‘em, spent the
             whole day practically.

                           BARBARA

             Yeah, I don’t know why she’s being
             so nice to a perfect stranger,
             but...

But he’ll take it. That reminds Barbara of something.

                           BARBARA
             Well... I ran into Liz Ruffcorn
             this morning. Guess she knows

             Guess Sharon has a reputation...
             Drinkin’ too much, gettin’ into
             all kinds of things... There’s a
             rumor she got pregnant back in her
             20’s but still wouldn’t slow
             down... gave birth to that baby
             and it never took a single breath.

Barbara shakes her head at the tragedy of it.

                           BARBARA
             Anyway...good for her for trying
             to change her ways. God never
             gives up on anyone, I’ll tell you
             what.

Ed thinks back on the “not really” comment. It makes more
sense now.


INT. SHARON’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Sharon sits at her kitchen table with BOLTS OF FABRIC and
SEQUINS LAID OUT, figuring out how to sew the skirt and
purse for the girls.


EXT. NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - DAY

Ed’s truck pulls in. He gets out, wearing his collared
shirt again, the PORTFOLIO and PAPERWORK under his arm,
nervously approaches the site manager’s trailer.


INT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

The Site Manager flips through Ed’s material. Ed waits
quietly, anxious.

             nice. I’ll get it to the guys

A beautiful day. Not a cloud in sight.


INT.   ED’S BATHROOM - SAME

The girls ready for the FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL. Ashley
brushes her teeth while Ed combs Michelle’s hair into two
PIG TAILS. He struggles with the rubber-bands, not very
good at this.

                           ED
             There ya go, all set.

Michelle turns around, stands on her tip-toes to see in
the mirror. Her pig tails are lop-sided, bumpy. She
scrunches her face, knowing they’re not right.

                           ED
             Hold on. Uh...

He tries to fix them. Ashley spits out her toothpaste.

                           ASHLEY
             I can do it for her.

                           ED
             Great. I’ll get going on
             breakfast.

He hands her the brush.


INT. ED’S KITCHEN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

TWO WAFFLES pop up from the toaster. Ed puts them each on
a paper plate, hurries to get the Syrup from the fridge.

The girls walk in, ready to go.

                           ED
             Eat up quick. Bus’ll be here in 8
             minutes.

             I know, you already told me.

                           ED
             And Michelle, if you feel even a
             little tired, you tell your
             teacher right away, alright? Even
             a little.

Michelle nods, understanding. Ed is still anxious.

The DOORBELL rings. He goes to goes open it. It’s Sharon.

                           SHARON
             Don’t mean to bother you.

             Was just on my way to work and
             wanted to drop these off for the
             girls real quick.

She holds up the SPARKLY SPINNY SKIRT and ELEGANT PURSE.
The girls have already made their way to the door.

                             MICHELLE
             That’s mine?!

                           SHARON
             Wait til you see how it spins.

Michelle takes the skirt, thrilled.

                           MICHELLE
             Can I wear it for the first day of
             school, daddy?!

                           ED
             If you hurry and change.

                           SHARON
             And here you are, madame.

Sharon hands Ashley the purse. She puts it on.

          Reach in and see if anything’s in
          there.

Ashley looks inside, finds a TUBE of LIP GLOSS.

                         ASHLEY
          Woah.

Step-up from the chapstick.

                        SHARON
          Hope that’s alright, dad.

                         MICHELLE
          Look at me!

Michelle comes out in her skirt, SPINNING.

                        SHARON
          Wow, you’re gonna take off like a
          helicopter!

The PHONE RINGS in the kitchen.

                         ED
          Do you mind?

                        SHARON
          Oh I should go anyway. I’ll see
          you girls later, alright?

Sharon leaves, and Ed heads into--


INT. ED’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

He picks up the phone.

                        ED
          Hello, Ed Schmitt.

                        BOB GREEN
          Ed, it’s Bob Green from R&R Homes.

Beat as Ed suddenly realizes this is THE call.

                        ED
          Oh, hey Bob...

                        BOB GREEN

          investors...

Ed holds his breath.

                           ED
             They want to make a deal with you.

Ed breathes again.

                           BOB GREEN
             They like your work. And all your
             references say you’re fast. They
             like that too.

                           ED
             That’s great news. Real great.

                           BOB GREEN
             Can you start today? Lot to do
             quickly.

                           ED
             Oh, uh, sure, I can be there in
             half an hour.

                             BOB GREEN
             See you soon.

Ed hangs up the phone. Can’t believe it. He stands there
a moment, grateful. Looks over at a FRAMED PHOTO of
Teresa from their wedding, finally feeling like he’s
making good on his promise to take care of the girls.

                           ASHLEY (O.S.)
             The bus is here!

Ed snaps out of it, looks out the window to see the
SCHOOL BUS pulling catty-corner to their house.

                           ED
             Okay, got your backpacks and
             lunches? Shoes all tied?

They grab everything they need, hurry out the door.

Ed watches the girls make run for the bus, Ashley holding
Michelle’s hand to cross the street.

make it through this.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

Bob Green is outside, directing a couple HARD HATS.

Ed walks up, ready for work.

                           BOB GREEN
             Hey Ed. Come’re, I’ll get you up
             to speed.

Ed follows him, still riding the high of winning the job.


EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE AREA -- A LITTLE LATER

Ed stands with Bob by a ROW OF NEARLY-FINISHED HOMES,
JUST DIRT surrounding them.

                           BOB GREEN
             It’s all going up in phases. Block
             by block, east to west. These 6
             here are first up. Walk-though
             models. They all need to be ready
             to show by the 15th.

Ed jots a note on a little pad.

                           ED
             October 15th, got it.

                           BOB
             No, of this month.

Bob nods.

                           ED
             You mean...6 days from now.

Bob nods again. Ed blinks. It’s a nearly impossible
schedule.

                           ED
             I...I’d have to have guys laying
             rebar today and pouring cement
             tomorrow.

Ed nods. Okay then. Out of the frying pan, into the fire.


INT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - ED’S DESK - EVENING

Ed’s on the phone, trying to crew up and order cement.

                           ED
             Yeah, I got a rush job, need 120
             yards ready-mix of 3000 PSI. Can
             you get me on the books for 7:30?

             Billy! Ed Schmidt. You and your
             guys free today?

We can see the answer is “no” by the look on Ed’s face.
He looks at his watch.

                           ED
             How about tonight?


EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

Ed and a CREW OF WORKERS lay REBAR under WORK LIGHTS.


INT. ED’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Barbara peaks out the kitchen window, Ed’s truck still
gone as she serves dinner to the girls and Ed Senior.

MONTAGE, the days going by--

- Ed manning the pump as CONCRETE pours over rebar.

--Ed and his crew carrying PIPES for IRRIGATION

- FRESH SOIL being off-loaded from the back of a TRUCK

--BRIGHT GREEN SOD unrolling on top of dirt

reading “Back to School Night.” Barbara and Ed Sr,
surrounded by young parents.

- Ed surveys a lawn as sprinkler heads pop up and spray.

- Ed working in his office, pulls the last post it note
reminder off his desk, tosses it the trash, DONE.


EXT. ED’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Ed’s truck pulls into the driveway. He gets out, lumbers
up to the door, bone tired.


INT. ED’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ed steps in to see his mom has fallen asleep in front of
the TV. He gently touches her shoulder, waking her.

                          BARBARA
             Oh. Hi...

                           ED
             Sorry I’m so late. How was back to

it: In order to provide for his girls, he can’t be

He heaves a sigh. Not an uncommon conundrum.

             I’m gonna go check on them...

Barbara nods. Ed disappears down the hall.

Orange leaves blanketing the streets. PUMPKINS on
porches. It’s Halloween Day.

Sharon lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, something
weighing on her today.

Finally, she pulls the covers off, willing herself up.

             G’morning.

Sharon   goes over to her station, sees a STYROFOAM CUP OF
COFFEE   and LITTLE WHITE BAG on her station. She opens the
bag --   a couple of DONUTS inside. She’s not sure who they
belong   to.

             Well...the teen years stink
             anyway. Least you dodged that
             bullet.

                           SHARON
             You know what I was thinking about
             this morning?

                             ROSE
             What?

             Today’s the first day I hate not-
             drinkin’.

Rose pauses, looks over at Sharon. Can see she’s not
joking, really means that.

                             ROSE
             Honey... I...

Rose isn’t quite sure what the right thing to say to that
is. The door CHIMES, Sharon’s client arriving.

                           CLIENT
             Sorry I’m late!

                           SHARON

             Boy am I glad to see you, will ya
             take a look at this mop...

Sharon goes over to her, the moment lost.

HUNDREDS OF PUMPKINS spread out in hay. Barbara watches
as the girls run through the patch, searching for their
favorites.

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH / DIRTY PARKING LOT - LATER

Barbara struggles to carry 2 HEAVY PUMPKINS, one in each
hand, through the dirt parking lot. The girls run ahead.

                        ASHLEY
          I’m gonna carve mine a unicorn.

          No, that’s copying.

                        BARBARA
          Slow down, wait for Grammy.

Barbara hurries to catch up with them. Her foot catches
in a pot hole, making her roll her ankle and FALL HARD
ONTO THE DIRT, the pumpkins rolling away.

The girls see it happen, run back to help her.


INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER

Barbara sits on an exam table, her ANKLE in a BRACE.

                        DOCTOR
          You’ve got a small fracture in the
          tibia. You’ll need to be off it

          6 weeks? Ugh. And it’s Halloween.
          I’m supposed to take ‘em trick or
          treating tonight.

          your dad’s working late again,
          said he’d try but don’t count on
          it.

The girls are crestfallen. What’s Halloween without trick-
or-treating? Barbara feels terrible.

Sharon is locking up the salon for the night, still
struggling against that tug of emptiness she woke up
with.

As she locks the deadbolt, she glances across the street
at the LIQUOR STORE....contemplating it. How much better
she’d feel in an instant.

Then...the PHONE RINGS inside the salon. She turns the
lock the other way, goes back inside to get it.

                           ED
             Oh. Yeah. No, I’ll do it.

He heads into the kitchen to make them something to eat.

                           BARBARA
             Well, since you mention it...
             Could maybe use some help around
             dinnertime a few nights a week...

Ed looks over at his mom. Had no idea she’d make this
request. A little uncomfortable with such a big ask.

                           SHARON
             Of course, sure, I’d love to.
             Though I should prob’ly tell ya,
             I’m not exactly the best cook in
             town... Might even be the worst.

                           BARBARA
             I can order you around the kitchen
             from my chair.

                           ED
             She can. Got a taste of it
             tonight.

Sharon laughs.

                           SHARON
             Great... then I’ll see y’all again
             on Wednesday, same time.

Barbara smiles: It’s a plan.

Ed is not so thrilled Sharon will be doing the job he
feels he should be doing, but what choice does he have?

MONTAGE--

--Ed at work late studying blueprints

--Sharon rushing off from the salon for her date with the
girls

--Barbara in a chair in the kitchen, instructing Sharon
how to prepare a pot roast.

INT. ED’S KITCHEN - EVENING

Sharon carefully pours PANCAKE BATTER into a hot pan.
Ashley walks in.

                        ASHLEY
          Pancakes? But it’s nighttime.

                        SHARON
          Never heard of breakfast for
          dinner? Special treat. Also the
          only thing I can make without your
          grammy’s help... She’s on a date
          with your grandaddy. Their
          Anniversary. 53 years...

Sharon scoops the pancake onto a plate for Ashley. Ashley
stares at, noticing its FUNNY SHAPE.

                        ASHLEY
          It looks like...E.T.?

Sharon grins, proud of her creation.

                        SHARON
          Took me two tries to get his
          skinny little neck.
                (then)
          Michelle, eat up, Mickey’s gettin’
          cold.

Michelle sits in front of her MICKEY MOUSE pancake, not
touching it.

                        MICHELLE
          I’m not hungry...

                        SHARON
          Not hungry for Mickey pancakes?

Michelle just pokes it with her fork. Sharon narrows her
eyes, worried. She feels Michelle’s forehead for a fever.

INT. THE GIRLS ROOM - LATER

Sharon sits between the girls’ beds, reading them Good
Night Moon.

                           SHARON
             And a comb and a brush, and a bowl
             full of mush... and a quiet old
             lady whispering hush...

Michelle COUGHS. Sharon looks over. The coughing stops.
She seems to be ok.

                           SHARON
             ...Goodnight room... Goodni--

Michelle COUGHS again, but this time it turns into a
COUGHING FIT. Sharon shuts the book, gets up.

                          SHARON
             Michelle--

Michelle’s cough turns into a GAG. BLOOD starts coming
out of her mouth. Sharon’s eyes flash with panic.

                           SHARON
             Ashley, call 911!

Ashley rushes to the phone as Sharon scoops up Michelle.


EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Ed is down on his hands and knees, working on an
electrical unit for outdoor lighting. An ASSISTANT from
the construction office runs up.

                           ASSISTANT
             Ed. Just gotta call your
             daughter’s being taken to Norton
             Children’s Hospital.

Ed freezes, a cold panic coming over him. He leaps to his
feet, calls out to one of his CREW.

                           ED
             Inspector’s here in 20. Handle it.

He takes off. Starts RUNNING.


INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL -       LATER

Docs check Michelle’s vital signs, hook her to an IV. A
FRANTIC BLUR. A blood-stained Sharon watches, helpless,
her arm around Ashley, who looks small and scared.


INT. ED’S TRUCK - SAME

Ed floors it down the highway.


INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - A LITTLE LATER

Ed bursts through the ENTRANCE, hurrying down the hallway
in search of Michelle’s room.


INT. MICHELLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Ed flies through the door, sees Michelle in the bed,
hooked up to several machines, asleep now.

Sharon stands near, Ashley by her side.

                           ED
             Tell me exactly what happened.

                           SHARON
             I... I don’t know... she just
             started coughing up blood. Out of
             nowhere. She wasn’t hungry for
             dinner, which I thought was a
             little strange, but--

                           ED
             She wasn’t hungry?

                          SHARON
             Well--

                           ED
             You should’ve called me that
             minute!

Sharon is taken aback by his anger.

                           ED
             That minute! I would’ve come. I
             would’ve been there.

Barbara hobbles in on her crutches, Ed Senior behind her.

                           BARBARA
                  (seeing Michelle)
             Lord have mercy.

Ed flags down a passing NURSE.

                           ED
             I want to talk to the doctor. Now.


LATER ---

Ed and his parents listen as DR. GHORBANI (50’s),
Michelle’s pediatric hepatologist, explains the
situation. Sharon sits in a chair nearby, eavesdropping,
Ashley curled up asleep on her lap.

                           DR. GHORBANI
             We’re doing everything we can to
             help reduce the hemorrhaging. But
             her condition is not good... We’ve
             moved her to #1 on the transplant
             list. She needs a donor liver to
             show up as fast as we can get
             it...

                           ED
                  (cuts to the chase)
             How long does she have without it.

The doc lowers his voice, hating to deliver these kinds
of estimates.

                           DR. GHORBANI
             4 weeks... 8 maybe.

Ed sets his jaw, trying not to fall to apart. Barbara
brings her hand to her mouth, Ed Senior puts an arm
around her, pulling her closer. Sharon looks over at
Michelle in the bed, can’t bear the thought.

                           DR. GHORBANI
             If a match becomes available in
             time, Michelle will need to
             immediately fly to the Children’s
             Hospital in Omaha.

             Omaha?

                           DR. GHORBANI
             They’re the closet ones who
             perform this kind of surgery. I
             recommend you arrange a plane to
             stand by. A donor liver is only
             viable for 6 hours. Patients have
             missed that window because they
             couldn’t get a flight.

Ed presses his eyes shut. This is all so impossible.

                           ED
             We need a plane now too. A plane.

This task is so preposterous it’s enraging.

                           DR. GHORBANI
             Look, I know it’s--

                           ED
             And how the fuck are we supposed
             to “arrange a plane,” doctor?

Barbara puts a hand on Ed, trying to calm him down.

                             BARBARA
             Ed... Please.

                           ED
                     (to doctor)
             No. Tell me. How are we supposed
             to do that?

Sharon chimes in, trying to settle things too.

                           SHARON
             Ed, we’ll do it. We’ll figure it
             out somehow. We will.

Ed looks over at Sharon, then his mother and Ed Senior.
He can’t take it anymore and just walks out of the room.


EXT. LOUISVILLE - DAY

The trees are jagged sticks, the air cold and crisp.

INT. HOPEWELL CHURCH - SAME

Barbara and Ed Senior sit in Sunday church service,
listening to MINISTER THOMAS’s sermon. She closes her
eyes, tuning out the Minister for a moment to pray on her
own for Michelle.


INT. INCH BY INCH SALON - SAME

Sharon talks to Rose as they both mix up hair color.

                        SHARON
          I’ve gotta find a private plane to
          stand by, ready to go whenever she
          needs it. Think. Do you know
          anyone with one of those?

                        ROSE
          Maybe one of my friends?

                        SHARON
          Really?

                        ROSE
          Shit no! You think I got friends
          like that?!

Sharon keeps thinking, determined.

                        SHARON
          I gotta get this damn plane, Rose.

Rose sighs, shaking her head, understanding the stakes
but having no idea how Sharon can pull it off.

Ed rolls Michelle in a wheelchair out to his track, a

             I’m sorry, honey... When you get
             better, okay?

Michelle sighs, hoping it’s soon. Ed gets up to send
Ashley off, trying to be all things to both girls.

             That’s ridiculous, the grade’s
             stamped all over the rebar. I have

INT. SHARON’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Sharon sits at her kitchen table, a YELLOW PAGES PHONE
BOOK open next to her, finds a listing for an AVIATION
COMPANY. She dials.

          Huh?

                        SHARON
          The CEOs’ll never gimme the time
          of day, I’ve gotta pitch the
          secretaries!

Rose gives her a thumbs up.

                        SHARON
                (hugs the woman)
          You’re a genius!

The woman grins, still totally lost.


INT. OFFICE BLDG. - LATE AFTERNOON

Sharon sits with MR. GONZALEZ’ SECRETARY, showing her
photos of Michelle. She has tears in her eyes.

                        SECRETARY #1
          This poor child...

                        SHARON

ANOTHER OFFICE, ANOTHER SECRETARY--

                           SECRETARY #2
                      (resolute)
             We can’t let this happen. We’ve
             got to do something.

                             SHARON
             Yes we do.

A THIRD OFFICE, A THIRD SECRETARY--

                           SECRETARY #3
                  (into intercom)
             Bill, there’s a woman here you
             should meet. It’s important.

                           BILL (O.S.)
             I’m busy, tell her come back
             later.

                           SECRETARY #3
             Bill, get your ass in here now.

Sharon’s eyes widen. She’s allowed to talk to her boss
like that?

Bill immediately APPEARS, all smiles.

                             BILL
             Hi, I’m Bill.

The secretary smiles proudly.


INT. ED’S HOUSE - DAY

Barbara limps around, making dinner, her foot slowly
starting to heal. There’s a KNOCK at the door. She goes
over to open it, finds Sharon outside.

                           SHARON
             Guess what I got.

                           BARBARA
             Wait. No way. You got the plane?

                  (beat)
             I got five planes. Just in case.

Barbara lets out a SQUEAL, hops around on her good foot,
hugging Sharon.

                           BARBARA
             I can’t believe it! I can’t
             believe it! Thank you god, thank
             you god!

Ashley runs over, joining in their celebration. Ed comes
down the hall to see what the commotion is.

                           ED
             What’s going on?

Barbara’s face is streaked with tears.

                           BARBARA
             Sharon did it. She did it. We’ve
             got a plane. A whole buncha
             planes!

Ed is gob-smacked. Looks over at Sharon, astounded by
what she’s accomplished.

                              ED
             I...    wow...

Despite himself, he can feel it again: a sliver of hope.


EXT. LOUISVILLE - DAY / EARLY DECEMEBER

CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS starting to go up around town.


EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME

More homes are finished now. It’s actually starting to
look like a tiny neighborhood.

Ed oversees a CREW smooth-finishing the cement driveways
of THREE FANCY CUL-SEC-SAC HOMES with lots of upgrades.

He notices the cement is drying before they can smooth it
out properly.

             That load was hot, it’s going off
             too fast. Add some water.

The FINISHER slowly lumbers over to get the hose, spray
it down. Ed hurries him, knowing how quick this can go
wrong.

                            ED
             Move it.

The FINISHER goes faster, a little annoyed. The OFFICE
ASSISTANT approaches.

                           OFFICE ASSISTANT
             Ed, got a call inside.


INT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Ed picks up the phone.

                            ED
             Ed Schmitt.

                           ED’S NEIGHBOR
             Ed it’s Cliff Donahue, what’s
             going on over there at your house?

                            ED
             ‘scuse me?

                           ED’S NEIGHBOR
             Got a bunch of news crews in your
             driveway. What’s going on?

Ed furrows his brow. Suddenly, he can think of only one
reason: Something has happened to Michelle.


EXT. ED’S TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

Ed barrels home as fast as he can.


EXT. ED’S NEIGHBORHOOD - A LITTLE LATER

Ed peels around the corner onto his street.

Sees the NEWS VANS, the FLURRY of activity around his
house. Hurries to park.
                   Revision                             79.


EXT. ED’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ed hurries out, pushes through the reporters, up the
driveway to his front door.

                        ED
          What the hell’s going on? This is
          my house.


INT. ED’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ed steps inside, sees CAMERA CREWS set up filming
Michelle in an INTERVIEW, Sharon and Barbara looking on.

                        ED
          What’s happening? What is this?

Barbara shushes him to be quiet for the crew.

                        BARBARA
          Sharon called the news. Thinks the
          more people who know about
          Michelle, we can raise the money
          for her surgery...

Sharon looks over at Ed, holding up a pair of CROSSED
FINGERS that her idea will work out.

Ed is seething. AMY CHAN (30’s), reporter for the local
radio news station, suddenly realizes who he is.

                        AMY CHAN
          Wait, this is the father?
                  (to Ed)
          I’m Amy Chan from KPPI radio. Can
          I ask you a few questions as well?

The OTHER REPORTERS overhear this, and begin to DESCEND
ON ED. He backs away, inundated, not liking this at all.

                        ED
          No. No you can’t.

He turns around, leaving. Barbara and Sharon exchange
look, not sure why he’s so upset...


EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - A LITTLE LATER

Ed pulls back up back to the site, gets out of his truck,
still upset.

He hurries back to the driveways, finds Bob Green
standing near them, frustrated.

                           BOB GREEN
             There you are.

Bob points to the sections of two driveways. The cement
looks sloppy, inconsistent.

                           BOB GREEN
             The load went off before they got
             through the finish.

Ed’s eyes fall shut. Exactly what he was trying to make
sure wouldn’t happen.

                           BOB GREEN
             We’ve gotta jackhammer them both
             out and re-pour.

A colossal mistake. Huge.

                           BOB GREEN
             Dammit, Ed.

                           ED
             Bob, I’ll make it right.

                           BOB GREEN
             No. We’ll pay you for what you’ve
             done, but we can’t use you on the
             rest of the project.

                           ED
             Bob, wait--

                           BOB GREEN
             No, look, I know you got a lot of
             personal stuff going on, and I
             don’t wish on anybody what your
             family’s going through... But this
             job is obviously a little too much
             for you to chew. I’ll have
             accounting tie up the loose ends.

Bob walks away. Ed stands there, gut-punched.


INT. THE GIRLS ROOM - EVENING

Michelle is asleep in her bed, tuckered out from the big
day with news crews.

Sharon adjusts her pillow a bit, makes sure all her
machines are working as they should.

Then softly closes the door, goes out to--


INT. ED’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

As she comes down the hall, Ed comes through the front
door.

                           SHARON
             Hey... Michelle just fell asleep,
             your mama took Ashley for ice-
             cream.

Ed doesn’t say anything.

                           SHARON
             Interview aired an hour ago. Amy,
             the reporter from the station
             called me, and you won’t believe
             it -- almost three hundred
             thousand dollars in donations
             already in, and they keep comin’.
             Michelle’s surgery’ll be covered,
             plus her care for a long time...

Sharon can’t believe the outpouring of generosity. It’s
incredible news.

Ed quietly nods, then turns, looking her right in the
eye, furious.

                           ED
             Mind telling me something, Sharon.

Sharon is thrown by his tone.

                           SHARON
             Um...

                           ED
             I don’t care if you mind. This is
             my house. Mine. And you think you
             got the right, coming in here, to
             my house, with my girls, acting
             like you own the goddamn place?

Sharon doesn’t know what to say.

             all over the TV?!

             Ed, I’m sorry, I thought you’d--

                           ED
             YOU THOUGHT WRONG. So lemme set it
             real straight for you.

He gets in her face, boiling over.

                           ED
             You are not welcome here in this
             house, Sharon. You aren’t those
             girls’ mother, you aren’t our
             family, you aren’t anybody. You
             got the whole town fooled thinkin’
             you’re such a hero, doing all this
             for a poor little girl. You aren’t
             doing this for her, you’re doing
             it for you. Wanna feel better you
             drank your own kid to death so now
             you’re trying to save mine. Well,
             she ain’t your free ride to
             redemption. Go find another sob
             story to leech onto.

Sharon is frozen. Can’t speak, tears gathering in her
eyes. She quickly gathers up her stuff to leave. Ed
watches her go.


EXT. ED’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Sharon rushes to her CAR, tears falling down her face
now. She gets in, slams the door, starts the engine.


INT. SHARON’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

She’s about to drive off but looks over to see: The PURSE
she made for Ashley, on her passenger seat, accidentally
left there during an outing.

If she’s never going to see them again, she has to give
it back.

She grabs it off the seat, gets out of the car--

INT. ED’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ed turns around to Sharon coming back up the driveway.

                        SHARON
          Ashley left it.

She sets the purse down, about to turn and leave again,
but then--

                        SHARON
          You know Ed, I’m not proud of who
          I am. I’ve been a drunk so much of
          my life, I don’t know where half
          of it went.

Ed turns around to face her.

                        SHARON
          I’m sorry if I hurt you or those
          girls or anybody, ‘cause I swear
          all I ever wanted to do was make
          it easier, even a little.

She pauses, finding these next difficult words...

                        SHARON
          And you’re right...I did. I stole
          my own baby’s life away from her.
          But it wasn’t from drinkin’, or
          any of that...

She’s never said this out loud, doesn’t know if she can
bring herself to...

                        SHARON
          I didn’t want her.

She shakes her head at what an awful thing that is to
say.

                        SHARON
          I spent everyday for nine months
          wishing she wasn’t there. I didn’t
          want her. To raise a child. I felt
          like a child myself.

All of the conflicting feelings come back.

                        SHARON
          And then... 8 days before she was
          due, Halloween day...she gave me
          my wish.

                           SHARON (CONT'D)
             And when I saw her...I knew. She
             could feel it, the whole
             time...her own mama didn’t want
             her... How do you start a life
             like that...?

The thought of it still wrecks her.

                           SHARON
             I’ll never forgive myself for
             that... And not even your daughter
             livin’ can fix it.

Ed is quiet. Even through the haze of his own emotions,
he sees she is stating a central truth.

                           SHARON
             My life has gotten better because
             your girls are in it, because of
             helping ya’ll. Coming here, to
             this house, every corner of it
             made by a mama in love with her
             baby girls. But if that’s why I
             did all this... well, that ain’t
             right.
                     (meaning it)
             It ain’t right.

Sharon wipes her eyes. Genuinely scared she’s just broken
enough for that to be true.

She quietly exhales. Then turns, and walks out.

Ed stands there alone for a moment, hearing the silence
in the room.

He goes to the BACKDOOR, gestures to Ashley and Michelle,
PLAYING IN THE BACKYARD SNOW. Michelle looks skinnier,
paler. She still has her spunk, but the disease is taking
its toll.

          How do you know?

                        ED
          Just... not today.

Barbara gives Ed a look: Why are you doing this? He
brushes it off, not wanting to get into it right now.


EXT. LOUISVILLE - AN HOUR LATER

Snow barrels in from all directions. Officially BLIZZARD
conditions.


EXT. ED’S LIVING ROOM -   LATER

The house RATTLES against the howling wind. Out the
windows, it’s a TOTAL WHITE-OUT. The girls huddle closer
to Ed, a little nervous, the family gathered around the
TV, watching the NEWS.

                        FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR
          Officials are calling it the worst
          blizzard in state history. 42,000
          homes without power, half of the
          interstates closed, and all
          inbound and outbound flights
          grounded. Highway patrol urges
          everyone to stay off the roads and
          hunker down where you are. This
          storm isn’t going to let up
          anytime soon, and appears to be
          intensifying.

                        ED SENIOR
          Hope we bought enough food...

Even Ed Senior has never experienced mother nature like
this.

The PHONE RINGS in the kitchen.

Barbara gets up, goes in to answer it.

                        BARBARA
          Hello?
               (beat)
          Oh, yes, hi Dr. Ghorbani. It’s
          Barbara.
               (beat)
          Go on...

As Barbara listens, her expression slowly begins to fall.

She looks as if her legs might crumble underneath her.

Finally...

                          BARBARA
                  (quietly)
             Thank you.

She hangs up the phone, just stands there, staring out
the window at the ROARING STORM, paralyzed with emotion.

Ed walks into the kitchen, notices the state she’s in.

                           ED
             What’s wrong? Who was that?

Barbara just shakes her head. Can’t bear to say it.

                          ED
             Ma...?

Ed Senior walks in, concerned now too.

Barbara finally looks over at both of them, musters the
words...

                           BARBARA
             They’ve got the liver. On the one
             day we can’t get to it.

Ed and his father are frozen as they process this
unimaginably bad luck.

Barbara’s eyes suddenly pool with tears. Her faith can’t
hold her up anymore. Not through this.

                           BARBARA
                      (breaking)
             It’s not fair. It’s just cruel.

The girls look over, notice her getting upset.

                           MICHELLE
             Grammy? What’s wrong?

Barbara realizes they’re watching, and hurries into the
other room so they won’t see her fall apart.

Ed and his father exchange a look. Neither has any words.

Ed heads down the hall, into--

INT. ED’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

He opens the door, finds Barbara facing a corner in the
far side of the room, quietly sobbing. He goes to her
side.

                          ED
          Ma...

He puts his arms around her. She hates that she isn’t
strong for him right now. Tries to stop crying.

                        BARBARA
          I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

                          ED
          No, Ma...

He pulls her close.

                        BARBARA
          What do we do...

                        ED
          We find some way.

                        BARBARA
          But what way? How?

                        ED
          I don’t know...

That’s the problem. Barbara sighs, utterly defeated. Ed
looks down, centering himself. Then--

                        ED
          Look. I told Teresa I’d take care
          of our girls. I’m not gonna let
          her down.

Barbara can see the conviction in his eyes.

                        ED
          We’ll find a way.

And for the first time, it’s his hope buoying her.


INT. SHARON’S HOUSE - DAY

Sharon’s fiddles with her OLD WALL HEATER, turning it up
to full blast. A KETTLE begins to WHISTLE on her stove.

from the cupboard.

The PHONE rings.

             Hello, it’s Sharon.

                           ED
             Sharon, it’s Ed...

Sharon pauses, not expecting to hear his voice on the
other end of the line.

                           SHARON
             Oh... hi, Ed...

                           ED
             Look, I’m gonna cut to the chase
             because there isn’t much time. I
             owe you an apology. A big one.
             These past few months, you kept my
             family afloat, and it shoulda made
             me grateful, but instead it tore
             me up I couldn’t do it myself...
             I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve what
             I said to you. Truth is, I don’t
             even wanna think about where we’d
             be if you hadn’t come along to
             help...

She can feel his sincerity.

                           ED
             And, well, right now... I need
             your help again, this time more
             than ever.

Sharon sits up straighter, listening.

                           ED
             Michelle’s gotta be in Omaha in
             less than 6 hours. Half the roads
             are closed, the airport is shut
             down, and all the airplanes are
             grounded.

We stay on Sharon’s face, registering what they’re up
against. It’s insurmountable.

                           ED
             Today’s the day. We gotta get it
             done.

            Have her bags packed. I’ll call
            you back.

She hangs up, her brain hitting warp speed.

Ed puts the receiver back, goes to the HALL CLOSET to get
the SUITCASE out. Barbara and Ed Senior exchange a look,
no idea how they’ll pull this off.


INT. ROSE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Rose pre-heats the oven, dumps a bunch of FROZEN TATER
TOTS onto a pan.

A BUNCH   OF HER FAMILY MEMBERS, including MARCUS and
KELVIN,   have gathered at her house to ride out the storm.
They’re   a LOUD GROUP, talking and laughing as they play a
game of   UNO.

Her PHONE rings.

                          ROSE
            Hello?

                          SHARON
            I need you to call highway patrol,
            find out which roads are open, and
            plot a route from 12th and Henley
            to the airport.

                          ROSE

                          SHARON
            It’s liver time. This is it.

Rose drops the bag of tots.

                          ROSE
            Sweet Jesus. Today?

She looks out her window at a NEIGHBOR’S CAR buried in a
snow drift.

                          SHARON
            As fast as you can do it. The
            flight’s 2 hours, plus an hour to
            the hospital and 30 minutes to
            prep her.

             Do it. I got this.

Rose hangs up, turns to her FAMILY, yells at the top of
her lungs---

                           ROSE
             EVERBODY SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

They all stop talking at once, look at her, shocked.

          pilot?

                        SECRETARY #3
          Just got off with him... I’m
          sorry, Sharon. Even if he could
          fly, he’s all way in Ramsey, he’ll
          never get there in time...

Sharon’s eyes fall shut.

                           SHARON
          Thank you...

She hangs up, looks down at her list of 5 airplanes.
Crosses THE LAST ONE off.

Then just sits there, gutted. What does she do now?

The PHONE rings.

                        SHARON
          Hello it’s Sharon.

                        ALBERT
          He can take the plane up.

                        SHARON
          What? Really? He’ll do it?

                        ALBERT
          Retired air-force, flown in storms
          worse than this. He’s on his way
          now.

                        SHARON
          Thank you, Al! Thank you more than
          you’ll ever know!

Sharon looks heavenward, thanking whoever or whatever
made this miracle happen.

INT. ROSE’S HOUSE - SAME

Rose and her family are still gathered around the NEWS,
anxiously watching updates.

                        TRAFFIC REPORTER
          More bad news from the highways.
          Closures on 134, Highway 6, and
          big rig jack-knifed on Canyon
          Creek, blocking both directions--

                        ROSE
          Noooo. No no no no no! Shit!

The whole family MOANS at the bad luck.


INT. SHARON’S HOUSE

Sharon’s on the phone, just having heard the bad news,
frantically searches her brain for a fix.

                        SHARON
          We’ve gotta get ‘em to turn
          around, go a different route.

                        ROSE
          You’re not hearing what I’m
          sayin’, there is no other route,
          they’re all blocked.

                        SHARON
          Not one other route? There’s gotta
          be.

                        ROSE
          The only other way I see is
          through Meadowlake, but it’s 3
          times longer, in this snow, they’d
          be on the road 4 hours.

Sharon sighs, defeated. They’re so close. There has to be
a way.

                        ROSE
          God I wish that car could fly...

Sharon’s eyes suddenly brighten. Getting an idea.

                        SHARON
          Wait... a helicopter.

             No, I mean we really try to get a
             helicopter.

                           ROSE
             Okay... uh, how the hell we gonna
             get a helicopter?

                           SHARON
             I don’t know, I gotta think. I’ll
             work on it, you just find some way
             to stop ‘em before they get to
             that big-rig crash, get ‘em back
             here for plan B.

They both hang up, getting to it.

Sharon looks around, trying to figure out where to even
start on a helicopter.

She grabs the PHONE BOOK, opens it to the letter “H.”
Heating, Hearing Aids, Home Repair...

Nothing. She slaps the book closed, needing another idea.

As she quietly thinks, she hears the THE RADIO, on in the
background for live updates.

                           AMY CHAN (O.S.)
             ...I’m Amy Chan, and you’re

One of the reporters that came to the house to interview
Michelle. Sharon quickly finds the number to the station.

INT. ED’S TRUCK - MINUTES LATER

Traffic starts to slow in front of Ed. Soon, he comes to
a complete stop.

                           MICHELLE
             What’s going on, daddy?

Ed tries to see, but the snow is too thick to tell.

                           ED
             Not sure...

He turns on the a.m. radio, tuning it.

                           A.M. RADIO
             ...big rig down on Canyon Creek.

             before they’re able to get that
             tractor trailer off the road...

Ed swallows, instantly realizing the trouble they’re in.

                           ED
             Wait here a second, I’ll be right
             back.

Michelle looks a little scared.

                           ED
             Don’t worry. Right back.

Ed opens the door, climbs outside to --


EXT. CANYON CREEK ROAD - CONTINUOUS

He looks behind him, trying to figure out if there’s a
way to turn around out here. But he’s totally hemmed in,
cars behind him, in front of him, to the sides of him.

The people in front are starting to get out of their
cars, ABANDON THEIR VEHICLES.

His heart sinks. He is stuck here. For who knows how
long.

Suddenly, a HUGE DECKED-OUT LIFTED BRIGHT ORANGE 4X4
TRUCK with OVERSIZED MONSTER-TRUCK WHEELS comes barreling
down the shoulder.

It skids to a stop, the doors fling open. Rose’s cousins -
- Kelvin and Marcus -- jump out, wave Ed over.

                           KELVIN

Ed nods.

Ed has never been so grateful to see anybody in his whole
life. He hurries to get Michelle out of his truck.

                           MICHELLE

As he pulls her outside, she gets a load of Kelvin’s HUGE
CRAZY MONSTER TRUCK.

Ed laughs at the “joke.” Then realizes they aren’t.

             We’re barely a quarter through...

                           ROSE
                  (yelling at her
                   family)
             Faster! Dig! Dig! Dig!

Just then, the sound of a BLARING TRUCK HORN.

Everyone turns around in unison to see...

A GIANT PICK-UP TRUCK with a SNOW PLOW ATTACHED TO ITS
GRILL.

                            SHARON
             Who is that?

The old lady with the RAINBOW MOHAWK, Mrs. Allen, leans
out the passenger window of her son’s F-150.

                           MRS. ALLEN
             MOVE THE HELL OUT OF THE WAY!!!

Everyone quickly gets out of the way to let them through.


INT. KELVIN’S MONSTER TRUCK - MINUTES LATER

They’re still at a dead stop. Stuck.

                          MARCUS
                  (losing patience now)
             Come on.

Ed is sweating bullets in the backseat.

                           MICHELLE
             Is everything okay, daddy?

No, it’s not. But he can’t say that to her.

                           ED
             Yeah, honey. It’s fine.

He puts an arm around her, trying to believe somehow it
will be.

EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - A LITTLE LATER

The truck finishes plowing, just as the HELICOPTER comes
buzzing into sky above them. Everyone looks to the sky,
CHEERING.

                         BARBARA
          There it is!

                        ASHLEY
          It’s here! It’s here!

                        SHARON
          Everyone move back so he can land!

They all make room, wait for him to land. But the
helicopter just hovers overhead, snow blowing everywhere.

                        SHARON
          What’s going on. Why isn’t he
          landing?

                        ROSE
          Turn up the radio!

The minister’s wife turns it up.

                        AMY CHAN (ON RADIO)
          Getting word from the pilot. Go
          ‘head.

                        HELICOPTER PILOT
          I can’t see the landing area in
          the white out conditions. I’m
          sorry... I can’t land here.

It guts him to say it.

Sharon looks out over the landing area. The blowing snow
has already put a sheet of white powder over it, and more
is dumping down.


INT. KELVIN'S MONSTER TRUCK - SAME

The car in front of them starts to move. The guys let out
a collective sigh of relief.

                        MICHELLE
          Look daddy, we’re going.

Ed nods, sweating bullets.
                   Revision                          109.


EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT

The crowd is silent, confused, worried.

                        BARBARA
          Isn’t there something we can do?

Sharon is utterly defeated. Every solution, every miracle
-- used up.

Then...

Ashley, wrapped in her red blanket, walks towards the
center of the landing area.

                        ROSE
          Where she going?

Sharon watches, not sure. Ashley stops, takes her blanket
off, spreading it out over the white snowy ground. She
looks back at Sharon.

                        ASHLEY
          Does this help?

Sharon, not sure, looks up at the Helicopter.

A beat. The whole crowd on edge.

                        HELICOPTER PILOT (OVER RADIO)
          I can see that! Cover the area and
          I can land!

                        SHARON
          Everyone, run to your houses! Grab
          sheets, blankets, towels, anything
          you can!

The crowd instantly scatters, running to their homes.

--A set of closet doors swing open and a woman grabs a
stack of BLUE SHEETS.

- A man in his bathroom picks up a stack of PURPLE
TOWELS, then spots his PURPLE SHOWER CURTAIN and rips it
off the rod.

- MINISTER THOMAS is in the church, pulling giant RED
CURTAINS down from the windows.

-People in the parking lot are taking off their jackets,
offering them up too.

CONTINUED:

-Everyone spreads out the FABRICS, making a GIANT
COLORFUL PATCH WORK QUILT IN THE SHOW.

Sharon looks up at the sky, praying this works. Finally,
Amy breaks the silence.

                           AMY CHAN (OVER RADIO)
             He’s good! He’s good! He can land!

The crowd ERUPTS IN CELEBRATION. Barbara nearly falls to
her knees, relief all over her face.

The HELICOPTER starts to lower down, just as...

KELVIN’s MONSTER TRUCK turns the corner towards the
church.


INT. KELVIN'S MONSTER TRUCK - SAME

Ed looks out the window, his eyes going wide.

                            ED
             What the...

He watches the HELICOPTER descend from the sky, the
MASSIVE CROWD gathered around to pull this off.

                           MICHELLE
             Daddy! Daddy! Do you see that!!

Ed is pinned to his seat, watching. His eyes begin to
well up, absolutely overwhelmed.

As the chopper touches down, all the BLANKETS SWIRL AND
FLY THROUGH THE AIR, blowing in all directions like a
rainbow colored dandelion.

Kelvin and Marcus cheer, pounding the roof.

                           KELVIN
             YEAH BABY! THAT’S WHAT I’M TALKING
             ABOUT!

Ed and Michelle get out of the truck. Barbara, Ashley,
and Ed Senior run over.

                            BARBARA
             You made it!

They HUG. Barbara hurries them on their way.

CONTINUED:

                           BARBARA
             Go, go, go!

Ed picks Michelle up in his arms, runs towards the
helicopter, everyone CHEERING.

Just as he climbs in, he looks over his shoulder,
searching for someone in the crowd...

He finds Sharon. Their eyes LOCK for a beat.

His, expressing bottomless gratitude no words can convey.
Hers, expressing the honor of a thousand lifetimes.

Ed turns and climbs into the helicopter.

It LIFTS OFF, soaring away through the snowy sky...

The image getting lighter and lighter, until it has FADED
up to..

A PERFECTLY WHITE SCREEN.

And for a moment, everything STILL. SILENT.

Then... a SOUND.

Barely audible, but unmistakable nonetheless...

A slow exhale.

And with it, the weight of the world, released.




THE END




END TILE CARDS & PHOTOS:

The transplant was performed successfully just in time.

In 2014, Michelle Schmitt earned her college degree. A
year later, Ed walked her down the aisle.

Sharon, who never misses a family get-together, showed up
in a sparkly sequined dress.
