                                                       OVER BLACK:

      There’s a faint BEAT. Growing louder.

      It’s a HEARTBEAT. Blood rushing through veins.

      90 beats per minute--

            120 beats per minute--

                   150 beat per minute--

      BREATHING. Quick and shallow. Loud. Like our ears are
      plugged.

                                                         FADE IN:


      INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

      KATE ANDERS (16). Blotchy skin. Dry mouth. Verge of a panic
      attack as she stands off stage waiting.

      SCREECHING MICROPHONE FEEDBACK thrusts us into--


1.1   INT. AUDITORIUM - EVENT CENTER - MOMENTS LATER             1.1

      An auditorium packed with men and women in suits. Four judges
      wait expectantly at a center table.

      Kate stands on a massive stage, squinting to find her dad,
      OLIVER ANDERS (30s), pale and looks a decade older than his
      age. He’s her lighthouse in the dark sea of unfriendly faces.

      They lock eyes; he mouths her speech in unison with her.

                          KATE
                I’m Kate Anders and I’m honored to
                be chosen by the 2038 Governor’s
                Science Program to present my
                research on Liquid Natural Gas...

      As Kate continues, we make our way through the audience to
      the back of the auditorium where a woman in a black suit
      leans against the wall.

      This is SOFIA FLORES (30s) - finance rich, new money -
      watching Kate’s presentation. Carefully.
                                                                 2.


1.2   EXT. EVENT CENTER - NIGHT - LATER                          1.2

      Sofia steps on a cigarette, next to a pile of butts that
      tells us she’s been here a while. As she lights a fresh one,
      she checks an app on her phone.

      INSERT PHONE SCREEN:
                   Asset            --    SKO791IIV
                   Price            --    $426.87
                   Daily Change     --    +$3.46 (+0.81%)
                   Monthly Change   --    +21.22 (+5.17%)
                   Annual Change    --    +49.08 (+13.06%)

      All we really notice is that every number is green and the
      graph is going straight up.

      Sofia refreshes the screen. The same green graph. Then--

      The door opens. Kate and Oliver step out, all smiles,
      carrying a jumbo prize check.

                          SOFIA
                    (tossing her smoke)
                Congratulations, Kate. That gaseous
                state manipulation shit, wow.

                          KATE
                Thanks.

                          OLIVER
                    (politely)
                I’m sorry, who are you?

                          SOFIA
                Sofia from GC Bank.

      Sofia hands them each a business card.

                          SOFIA (CONT’D)
                But that doesn’t really matter.
                What matters, to you at least, is
                that the Governor’s Science blah
                blah blah has nothing to do with
                the Governor. Or Science. It’s
                owned by some P.E. firm up on 35th
                and Lex. And...
                    (Sofia nods at the check)
                $50,000 is how much they bought
                your IP for.

                          OLIVER
                That’s not right. It’s prize money.
                                                       3.


                    SOFIA
              (no pleasure in this news)
          Take a look at the signup docs: the
          prize money is paid out for
          underlying IP. You gave them
          everything for that check.

Oliver’s stomach is in his throat.

                    OLIVER
          I read the documents.

Father and daughter share a look. Yup. It was probably too
good to be true. Sofia stands by quietly. Then:

                    SOFIA
          I might be able to help.

                    OLIVER
          Thank you...
              (checks business card)
          Ms. Flores, but we’ll figure this
          out on our own.

Oliver gently starts to guide Kate away.

                    SOFIA
          I assume you’ve heard of the
          Prodigy Market?

                    OLIVER
          We’re really not interested in
          being sold anything right now.

                    SOFIA
          I’m not selling; I’m buying and I
          want my bank to buy a piece of your
          daughter’s lifetime earnings.

                    KATE
          Buy my lifetime earnings?

                     SOFIA
          A piece.
              (then)
          Companies put shares on a stock
          market for investors to buy and
          earn part of the profits. Right?

                    OLIVER
              (to Kate)
          We need to go.
                                                         4.


                    SOFIA
          You can do the same --

                    OLIVER
          Please leave us alone.

Oliver starts walking, but Kate lags behind.

                    SOFIA
          You can put shares out there, let’s
          call it, 15% of what you earn the
          rest of your life. And let people
          buy them from you now when you need
          the money the most.

                    KATE
          Why would I do that?

Sofia glances sideways at Oliver - the buzz haircut and bone
thin frame - but decides not to go there. Instead:

                    SOFIA
          To pay for the lawyer who could’ve
          looked at that paperwork. Pay for
          lab hours. College.

                    OLIVER
          The market’s a scam.

                    SOFIA
          I’ve been on the market for...
          Shit. A long time.
              (re: check)
          That is the scam.

Oliver is taken aback. He didn’t expect that.

                     SOFIA (CONT’D)
          I get it. Not a lot of trust in the
          world. I’m a banker. With an
          agenda. Looking to take advantage.
          All that is true. This isn’t
          charity work. I’m here to make
          money. And you could be the one to
          make it, for all of us. Listen. I
          think you’re special. I’ve been
          watching a lot of kids like you.
          They’re special too. So. If this
          isn’t for you. No hard feelings.
          I’ll move on to the next.
              (then)
          But please trust me when I say. I
          wish you nothing but the best.
                     (MORE)
                                                           5.

                       SOFIA (CONT’D)
                 (then; re: check)
             And congratulations again.

With that, Sofia turns and walks away. A driverless black car
pulls up and Sofia slides in... Kate watches her disappear.


EXT. MANHATTAN - 59TH STREET - DAY

Early morning, Sofia walks to work with her boss, ROBERT
HUGHES (58), rosy cheeks and kind eyes. If he weren’t a
banker, he may be Santa Claus.

                       SOFIA
             If you met Kate, if you heard about
             her tech, you wouldn’t feel this
             way. She’s fucking special.

It’s a normal Manhattan commute on a familiar Manhattan
street, but in the distance, we hear a MUFFLED RUMBLE.

                       ROBERT
             This is going to create bigger
             problems than making money.

                       SOFIA
             Not if we’re making enough money.
             I’m telling you, Bobby. This is a
             no-brainer.

                       ROBERT
             Whenever somebody calls something a
             “no-brainer” that’s exactly what it
             turns out to be.

Robert and Sofia turn the corner from 59th Street onto--

5th AVENUE

The MUFFLED RUMBLE explodes into a CHAOTIC ROAR. Central Park
bursts with aggressive, crazed protesters. Screaming and
shouting, but one chant rises about the rest:

                       PROTESTERS
             Change or die.
             Change or die.

The Avenue is barred off from the Central Park protesters.
Protective infrastructure has been built to help the security
detail, “Northrup Grumman” on their jackets, G36 Assault
Rifles and riot shields in hand.
                                                            6.


At the border between the park and the street, SECURITY
GUARDS shove protesters back, and drag others out, smashing
them with batons, and arresting them.

Every protester wears camo with a red-X spray painted across
the chest. And there’s an endless sea of them.

Sofia and Robert approach a security station and facial
recognition scanners flag them green for escort through.

This is their daily commute. Through a domestic war zone.

Two security men hold up their riot shields to traverse the
terrifying one block stretch to their office.

                    SECURITY GUARD
          Stay behind me. Keep moving. Don’t
          stop.

They know the drill, but it never feels normal.

Sofia and Robert keep pace with their guards. Rocks and
bottles CRASH into the riot shields like a hail storm.

Then, a pipe bomb lands behind them. The guard spots it.

                    SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
          Fuck--

And bends down to grab it and throw it. It crumples, just a
paper towel roll made to look dangerous.

But the guard has left an opening with his shield and--

An object SMACKS Sofia in the face. Robert rushes in front of
Sofia to block her from anything else.

Sofia glances at what hit her: a bundle of fake cash on the
ground by her feet.

                    SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
          Keep moving!

The two security guards rush them to the entrance of their
skyscraper and they step through the lobby doors into--


GLOBAL CITIZEN’S TOWER

Quieter now, but the chaos still visible through the front.

                    ROBERT
          Are you alright?
                                                                  7.


      Sofia FEELS her face. No blood. A little stirred up, but ok.

                            SOFIA
                I’m fine.

      Robert is SHAKING. Hard. As he reaches for cigarettes in his
      jacket pocket.

                          SOFIA (CONT’D)
                Are you alright?

      Robert NODS. Barely passable as “alright.” They continue
      toward the elevator bay... just another morning.

                          ETHER (PRE-LAP)
                I’ve been thinking about Edwin
                Drake. When everyone saw black
                sludge, Drake saw oil.

      They step into an elevator that knows which floor they’re
      going to based on facial tags and schedules.


1.5   INT. GLOBAL CITIZEN’S TOWER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY         1.5

      Sofia and Robert sit among a dozen high profile executives.
      Sofia is the youngest by at least a decade.

      ETHER KLINT (76) is the Chief Investment Officer of the bank.
      Physically frail, but a lion of intelligence.

                          ETHER
                For the last twenty-five months
                everyone has seen China dump
                treasuries, Uncle Sam fail loans,
                and their jobs disappear. What do
                we see?

                          MALE EXECUTIVE
                Opportunity. Opportunity to be lean
                and agile, starting with a reorg of
                the high risk assets department.

                          SOFIA
                Don’t call it a department reorg,
                call it what it is: the dismantling
                of my department.

                          MALE EXECUTIVE
                Whatever you call it, the Street
                will love the lower risk portfolio.

                            ETHER
                Sofia?
                                                         8.


Sofia glances over at Robert whose expressionless face says
everything: Don’t do it.

                    SOFIA
          I see opportunity in the Prodigy
          Market.

A few of the other execs shake their heads and laugh. Sofia
glances back at Robert. He’s frustrated.

                    MALE EXECUTIVE
          That market is just anonymous
          techies fucking around.

                    SOFIA
              (ignores the comment)
          Every sector is owned and
          overvalued. Energy is owned.
          Finance is owned, healthcare,
          education, defense, public
          services, owned, owned, owned.
          What’s left? What’s undervalued?
          Really, who is undervalued?

                    MALE EXECUTIVE
              (to Ether)
          Can we stop wasting time on this?

Sofia takes a small breath -- we can feel how important this
is to her.

                     SOFIA
          The global GDP is 85 trillion, all
          that value created by humans,
          working. And we don’t own any of
          it. Not a penny of their work, or
          ideas, or talent.
              (then)
          Right now The Prodigy Market is
          being played with by people living
          in their parents’ basements,
          throwing pennies and hoping for
          blackjack. And sure, a few will get
          lucky and make some money.
              (then)
          But we are an institution. We have
          the power to create and own a
          market place. We have the power to
          pick a kid and make sure he... or
          she... is a winner. Every time.

Beat.
                                                         9.


                    ETHER
          How would we even invest?

                    SOFIA
          Until we build the infrastructure?
          There are reputable websites that --

                      ETHER
          Websites?

                    SOFIA
          Just until we build a real market.

                    MALE EXECUTIVE
          This isn’t Field of Dreams.

There are laughs in the room.

                    SOFIA
          Good to know your investment
          strategies and movie references are
          both stuck in the 1980s.

Some laughs, some shock that Sofia swung back.

                    SOFIA (CONT’D)
          We need to be investing in the
          future. I just watched a kid sell
          her $10 billion dollar idea for $50
          thousand. And it wasn’t to us. If
          we had picked her, we’d have had
          our lawyers on her IP, we’d’ve
          bought into her tech, we’d collect
          fees on the sale, and then we’d
          take our cut from her. Everyone in
          this room knows the twenty ways we
          can make money on this.

Ether nods, a little interested. He calmly turns to Robert.

                      ETHER
          Robert?

All eyes turn to Robert, Sofia’s most of all as she silently
begs him to back her on this. Finally--

                    ROBERT
          The Prodigy Market is a non
          starter.

                    ETHER
              (nodding)
          Well, that’s that.

                            ETHER (CONT'D)
                     (then)
                 What’s next?

       Sofia CLOSES her eyes. Defeated. For the moment.


1.6    EXT. NYACK PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL - DAY                         1.6

       Outside a renovated cineplex from the 90s now a public high
       school, Kate heads out hugging her backpack. Swarms of kids
       are around her, but she walks alone.


1.7    EXT. PRIVATIZED BUS STOP - DAY                              1.7

       After school, Kate waits at a privatized bus stop as a bus
       with no driver pulls up. As kids pile onto the bus, Kate
       spots the digital pricing board:

           $15.50 - 3X SURGE RATE.

       She steps aside. She’ll wait for a later, cheaper bus.


1.8    INT. PRIVATIZED BUS - DAY                                   1.8

       On a less crowded, driverless bus, Kate works in her
       notebook. The bus moves down I-287.


1.9    EXT. THE SIDE OF I-287 - LATER                              1.9

       Kate steps off the bus and is left in a small pedestrian way
       as the sun sets.


1.10   EXT. RUNDOWN MOTEL 6 PARKING LOT - DAY                   1.10

       Kate walks across the parking lot with her backpack, I-287
       roars with traffic right behind the motel.

       She looks into an old-school facial recognition scanner and
       the front door pops open--


1.11   INT. RUNDOWN MOTEL 6 - CONTINUOUS                        1.11

       The lobby area is vacant - no one sits at the front desk,
       there’s no maid service, no coffee.

       Kate continues past a resident who sits on one of the old
       hotel chairs and smokes indoors. No one is going to stop him.
                                                               11.


1.12   INT. RUNDOWN MOTEL 6 ROOM - LATER                       1.12

       The once dual-queen room has been turned into a makeshift
       apartment. A hotplate and mini-fridge for a kitchen. Folded
       partitions create the illusions of privacy and 2 bedrooms.

       Kate enters to see her father, Oliver, sitting at a plastic
       table, papers scattered before him.

                           OLIVER
                 The banker was right. They got
                 nothing to do with the governor.

                           KATE
                 So they own my work?

                            OLIVER
                 For now.

                           KATE
                 How’ve they been getting away with
                 this?

                           OLIVER
                 Probably cause they offered four
                 times the prize money for our
                 ‘misunderstanding’.

                           KATE
                     (shocked)
                 We’re getting two hundred thousand
                 dollars?

                           OLIVER
                 That’s what they’re offering.

       Kate does the mental math. It doesn’t take that long. That’s
       more money than they ever thought possible.

                           OLIVER (CONT’D)
                     (absolutely not)
                 We’re not taking it.

       Beat.

                           KATE
                 We need to consider it.

                           OLIVER
                 It’s a bribe, Kate --

                            KATE
                 Dad --
                                                               12.


                           OLIVER
                 It’s hush money.

                           KATE
                 I know. But we need it. And I’m
                 sure you’ve convinced yourself they
                 win if we take it, but they still
                 win if we don’t. We’re just poorer.

                           OLIVER
                 You take it, you might as well say
                 you don’t matter. You don’t matter
                 to the friends who have to put
                 their families to sleep on the
                 floors of a stadium. You don’t
                 matter to the construction crews
                 who should have protections so your
                 mother would still be here today.
                 It’s better to die struggling than
                 to do the wrong thing.

       Kate gets emotional.

                           KATE
                 The right thing is for you to get
                 real treatment from real doctors,
                 Dad. That’s the right thing. And it
                 takes money to do that.

       Oliver takes a breath and hugs his daughter to comfort her.
       She doesn’t appear comforted in the least.

                           OLIVER
                 We’ll find a way. We always do.

       Beat.

                           KATE
                     (pulling back from hug)
                 That’s just not true.

       As she goes to lay down behind her partition, Oliver watches
       quietly.


1.13   EXT. ROOFTOP - GLOBAL CITIZEN’S TOWER - NIGHT           1.13

       Sofia and Robert smoke cigarettes with beautiful views of the
       nighttime city contrasting the ugly, industrial rooftop.

                           SOFIA
                 You could’ve supported me in there.
                                      13.


          ROBERT
You knew I was opposed to it.

          SOPHIA
Ether was gonna bite. He was going
to bite until you said--

          ROBERT
Fuck Ether. Let him destroy
people’s lives so the bank can make
an extra dollar. That’s his choice.

          SOPHIA
Earning the bank an extra dollar is
our job, Bobby.

          ROBERT
You want to pick which kids will be
successful, and which won’t. You
said it like that’s a good thing.

          SOPHIA
I meant that making the Prodigy
Market an establishment that anyone
can use is a good thing. There are
tens of thousands of kids who will
never get a shot unless
institutional investors get
involved. And the dollar signs are
too good to ignore.

          ROBERT
That’s what we told ourselves when
we privatized war and health and
education and incarceration. Now we
want to privatize opportunity? I
get it. They’re not people.
They’re data points. Pawns
expendable for the King. But --

          SOPHIA
That’s not what I said.

           ROBERT
But you use people like pawns long
enough and one day, they turn
around, march back down the board,
and slaughter the King themselves.
    (then)
That’s how it plays out. Every
time. And don’t convince yourself
this will be any different.
                                                              14.


                           SOPHIA
                 You’re so cynical about me.

       Robert is taken aback by that.

                            ROBERT
                 Not true. But you’re trying to move
                 so fast I’m worried you won’t see
                 the big brick wall ahead until--
                     (smacks the back of his
                      hand)
                 --it smashes you in the face.

                           SOPHIA
                 I don’t want to slow down.

                           ROBERT
                 How about just trying to pace
                 yourself instead?

       Sofia takes that in...

                           ROBERT (CONT’D)
                 Look, I’m not always going to be on
                 this rooftop with you.

                           SOFIA
                 You better be.

                           ROBERT
                 Just... if I’m not, still think
                 about what I would’ve said. And
                 listen to whatever that is.

       Sofia tosses her cigarette over the edge and laughs.

                           SOFIA
                 We both know I don’t even listen to
                 you when you’re actually up here.

       Robert laughs hard and Sofia joins him.

                           ROBERT
                 Fine, just give me another fucking
                 cigarette then.

       They laugh together and light up fresh cigarettes.

1.14   INT. THE NOAH TELLER CAMPAIGN BUS - NIGHT              1.14

       INSERT: A TV SCREEN - NEWS CHANNEL
                                                        15.


Drone footage of tens of thousands of protestors flooding
across Central Park. Camps show they intend to stay.

                    REPORTER (V.O.)
          Spurred on by a Debt Crisis Bill
          from Senator Rodgers that included
          the sale of Central Park,
          protesters stormed the park nearly
          six months ago and refuse to leave.

Footage of another street that looks like 5th Ave -- chaos
bursting from Central Park and bleeding into society.

                     REPORTER (V.O.)
          These protests have evolved into
          groups of rioters across the
          country who call themselves The
          Eucharist.

CRUNCH - a can of food is slammed across the face of a suited
man. Other protesters (now rioting) tackle security guards as
the bloody can is brought back down across the man’s skull.

                    REPORTER (V.O.)
          They claim to be a peaceful
          opposition to the privatization of
          America’s public goods and security
          nets, but violence has marred the
          group with at least four dead and
          dozens of others missing around
          Eucharist protests. There are
          bipartisan calls for stronger
          efforts to disperse the group.

INSERT -- SENATOR RODGERS (60s), looking like a politician.

                    SENATOR RODGERS
          I’ve denounced The Eucharist and
          demand they be labeled a terrorist
          organization so that we can address
          them with the appropriate and
          necessary force.

INSERT -- The campaign bus is filled with posters of a large,
smiling Noah Teller. Young and handsome. A big slogan printed
under him: “America for All” and the election year - 2038.

                    SENATOR RODGERS (CONT’D)
          I’m calling on my opponent, Council-
          Man Teller, to do the same. It is
          the only reasonable option for--
                                                        16.


NOAH TELLER (late 30s) turns off the TV and turns to his
husband, ALEX TELLER (30s) and campaign manager, MIRAH SAHL
(45).

                    NOAH
          He needs them to be an extremist
          group to distract from the fact
          that his fucking bill is what lit
          the powder keg.

                    MIRAH
          Well it’s working. Polls show
          strong support for Rodgers’
          approach to The Eucharist.

                    NOAH
          He shit the bed, and people are
          happy he’s burning the sheets?

                    ALEX
          According to the polls.

                    NOAH
          You know who they’re not polling?
          The fucking Eucharist. And they
          vote too.

                    MIRAH
          Will they though?

                    NOAH
          They’re angry.

                    ALEX
          Everyone’s angry. Not everyone
          votes.

Noah’s thinking about this opportunity.

                    NOAH
          They will for the right candidate.

                    ALEX
          Their ‘right candidate’
          nationalizes US corporations.

                    MIRAH
          Alex is right. Rodgers is
          exploiting it, but they are
          extreme. You can’t court them and
          keep your base.
                                                         17.


                    NOAH
          What they want is not extreme.
          Jobs, a chance, a voice. We could
          have an event in Central Park--

                    ALEX
          It’s a war zone, Noah. They’ve
          killed four people--

                    NOAH
          --we can be their voice. We can
          help them without the violence or
          the fear.

                    ALEX
          They smashed a man’s head in with a
          can of fucking baked beans.

                    NOAH
          I thought it was chunky chicken
          noodle.

                    ALEX
          This is serious. I’m not ready to
          be a widower. We can find other
          votes.

                     NOAH
          It’s not just about votes. We can
          help them.

                    ALEX
          They don’t want your help. They
          hate you. Just as much as they hate
          Rodgers.

                    NOAH
          Most people get into politics to be
          liked. It’s why they hire kiss
          asses and hold rallies for fans. I
          got in to prove that I could make
          the people who hate me vote for me
          anyway because of ideas.

Alex struggles to debate his husband who debates for a
living. Noah softens his approach--

                    NOAH (CONT’D)
          That’s why we need to hold this
          rally. For them. I need to you be
          ok with that.

But Alex isn’t. He’s scared for his husband.
                                                               18.


                           ALEX
                 What if I can’t be?

       Noah digests that. Alex always supports him; this is new.

                           NOAH
                 We’ll figure it out later.

       Noah kisses his husband, dodging the conversation for now.


1.15   INT. SOFIA’S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - DAY                  1.15

       BLARING MUSIC. Two sets of health fundamentals projected on
       the wall - both heartbeats spiking.

       A treadmill spins full speed with no one on it.

       Only half-clothed in workout gear, Sofia is on top of her
       naked, save the shoes, husband JACK CRAWFORD (37). Looks like
       he spends a lot of time here, you know, actually working out.

       Sofia, who has tattoos on her arms she keeps hidden at the
       bank, moves with her husband until they’re interrupted by--

       RING. RING.

       The health screens switch to show an incoming call.

                              SOFIA
                 Ignore it.

       Jack looks upside down at the caller ID.

                     (delicately)

                           JACK
                 It’s Mount Sinai Hospital.

       Sofia jumps off of him and grabs her cell--

                           SOFIA
                 This is Sofia Flo--

1.16   ROBERT’S DEAD BODY                                        1.16

       He’s pale. Eyes sewn shut. It’s a jarring transition. From
       the loud music to deathly silence.

                           SOFIA (O.S.)
                 Yeah. Yes. That’s him.


1.17   INT. MORGUE - MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY                  1.17

       The nurse pulls the white sheet over Robert’s head and
       readies to push him back into the tiny mortuary cooler.

                           SOFIA
                 He’s claustrophobic. Don’t...

       Sofia trails off as she realizes what she’s saying.

                           SOFIA (CONT’D)
                     (changing the subject)
                 You haven’t told me how he died.

                           NURSE
                 The autopsy isn’t performed until
                 after the body is identified.

                           SOFIA
                 They know though, right?

       The Nurse looks empathetically at Sofia...

                           NURSE
                 The needle was still in his arm.

       Sofia is shocked but swallows it. She looks back at the white
       sheet; Robert’s dead body underneath.

       Kate stands in a line of people on the side of a city
       sidewalk. Members of The Eucharist hand out pamphlets with
       information about their movement.

       Kate takes one. “Fear is Good” printed on the front. Kate
       flips through the pamphlet mindlessly as the line moves.


1.19   INT. OSIRIS DATA COLLECTION CENTER - DAY                  1.19

       A friendly FACE-ON-THE-SCREEN welcomes Kate to a computer
       station:
                                                                 20.


                           FACE-ON-THE-SCREEN
                 Welcome back, Kate. Please place
                 your cell phone on--

       Kate sets her phone on a wireless connector and the computer
       jumps forward to the next sequence.

                           FACE-ON-THE-SCREEN (CONT’D)
                 Thank you. Please insert your

                 anonymized and used only...

       As the Face-on-the-Screen goes on about the security of the
       data, Kate chooses the largest package: 3-months worth of
       data, including bank statements, calls, internet searches,
       and health records.

                           FACE-ON-THE-SCREEN (CONT’D)

                 primary credit card...

       Kate stares at the receipt, focusing on the $45. That’s it...

       She grabs her things and leaves before the Face-on-the-Screen
       finishes.


1.21   EXT. FAIRFAX COUNTY OLD MONEY HOME - DAY                  1.21

       A classic American red brick with lush green foliage around
       it that can only be maintained with a staff of people. It’s
       not over the top; the wealth is subtle.


1.22   INT. FAIRFAX COUNTY OLD MONEY HOME - DAY                  1.22

       A lively family around the dining table for post-church
       Sunday Brunch. Kids, grandkids, cousins, and friends.

       VERA SAX (56), the matriarch of the family, smiles at her
       daughter, ELIZA (30), who scolds her young daughter ALI (4)
       with a look.

                           VERA
                 She’s a toddler, you can go easy on
                 her.

                           ELIZA
                 Where was that when you were my
                 mother?
                                                                  21.


                           VERA
                 I still am your mother. I’ve just
                 had more experience now.

       Ali cleans up her hands with her napkin. She sits upright in
       her chair -- a mature, well-behaved 4-year-old.

                           ELIZA
                 Are you saying you were too tough
                 on us as kids? Because if so--

                           VERA
                 No. I’m just telling you that you
                 might be too tough on her.

                           ELIZA
                 Ahh, there she is.

       Vera’s phone vibrates; she checks to see who’s calling.

                           VERA
                 Only because I love you...
                     (taps Ali on the nose)
                 Both.

       Vera slips away from the dining room, but not before her
       daughter can get out --

                           ELIZA
                 If God rested on the 7th, I think
                 the Fed Chair can too.

                           VERA
                 God made the world with the snap of
                 a finger. Some of us actually have
                 to work to get things done.

       Vera brings the phone to her ear.

                           ETHER (ON PHONE)
                 Robert’s dead.

                           VERA
                 Understood.

       Vera HANGS UP, RATTLED by the news.


1.25   INT. SOFIA’S OFFICE - GLOBAL CITIZENS TOWER - NIGHT        1.25

       Global Citizens is empty except for a lonely janitor.

       Sofia sits on the ground, scrolling through her computer.
                                                           22.


                    ETHER (O.S.)
          We pay a lot for those chairs, you
          know.

Sofia jumps up from the ground slightly embarrassed. Ether
looks at her from the doorway.

                    ETHER (CONT’D)
          Robert was so pleased when you got
          this office. Don’t get me wrong, he
          was happy for you, but mostly he
          was pleased that he was right when
          he hired you and no one else
          thought we should.

Sofia avoids eye contact with Ether.

                    SOFIA
          Did you know he was using again?

                    ETHER
          Had I known, I think I would’ve
          killed him myself.

Ether closes the door and lowers himself onto her couch.

                    SOFIA
          I just don’t get it.

Sofia isn’t quite sure how to describe it.

                    ETHER
          You didn’t know him when he was in
          deep. Can’t blame him after what
          happened. But Jesus, if you had
          seen him then this’d be a little
          less shocking now.

                    SOFIA
          So it makes sense to you?

                    ETHER
          Sense doesn’t make it hurt any
          less.

They both take a breath. Finally --

                    SOFIA
              (handing tablet to Ether)
          Can I show you something?

On screen: a $1 wire Robert sent. In the memo: “1913 - 2038”.
                                                          23.


                    SOFIA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
          Last week, Robert sent a $1 wire
          transfer with that memo.

                    ETHER
          Where’d you get this?

                    SOFIA
          Apparently, I’m executing his will.

                    ETHER
              (maybe surprised, maybe
               not)
          No shit.

                    SOFIA
          I think they look like birth and
          death dates, but no one is 125
          years old, so... I don’t know.

Ether takes a second to process that information. Then --

                    ETHER
          Who’d he send the wire to?

                     SOFIA
          Holding corps. I can’t track the
          ownership.

                    ETHER
          Do you have a guess?

                    SOFIA
          No idea. I’d say his dealer, but
          last I checked, smack cost more
          than a buck.

Ether looks at Sofia sympathetically.

                    ETHER
          I know you’ll miss him. I will too.
          But I wouldn’t try to hold on to
          him with bank statements. Most
          people try pictures.

Ether hands her a framed picture of Robert and Sofia
accepting a banking award together. Smiling ear to ear.

                    ETHER (CONT’D)
          When they were clearing out his
          office I had them save this for
          you.
                                                                 24.


       Sofia can’t look at the picture afraid of tearing up in front
       of Ether. She manages to get out:

                              SOFIA
                 Thank you.


1.26   INT. NOAH’S HOME - MORNING                                1.26

       Noah and Alex watch a crew set up a shoot in the living-room
       of their beautiful suburban home. Noah is perfectly groomed;
       Alex a bit more flustered.

                           ALEX
                 I don’t know why I have to be in
                 front of the camera.

                           NOAH
                 New Yorkers love you more than they
                 love being New Yorkers.

                           ALEX
                 I don’t want to defend anything for
                 a million people to dissect.

                           NOAH
                 You won’t have to defend The
                 Eucharist. I swear.

       Mirah comes over and fixes a piece of Alex’s hair.

                           MIRAH
                 They are ready for you two.

       Alex shoos her away from his hair.

                           ALEX
                 That’s Noah’s job.

                           MIRAH
                 He’s doing a shit job.

                           NOAH
                 You look great. Let’s go.

                                                            CUT TO:

       Noah and Alex sit next to each other on their couch mid
       interview. Noah is a new man when the cameras are on -
       perfect and polished.

                           NOAH (CONT’D)
                 --of course, I denounce the
                 violence.
                           (MORE)
                                                        25.

                    NOAH (CONT’D)
          It’s safe to say The Eucharist
          denounces that violence just as
          strongly.

                    INTERVIEWER
          But leaders of The Eucharist
          haven’t made any such statements.

                    NOAH
          Leaders? This is an organic
          movement of disenfranchised
          Americans. They’re not organized by
          an individual, but by an idea.

                    INTERVIEWER
          An idea that the 1% should be
          afraid.

                    NOAH
          They should be.

Alex glances over ever so briefly at his husband... Slight
concern.

                    INTERVIEWER
          I’m sorry, Council-Man Teller, you
          agree with their fear based agenda?

                    NOAH
          No, I agree that we should be
          afraid of a status quo that forces
          everyone but the 1% to be asking:
          Will I ever get a job? Will it ever
          pay enough for my family? Or will
          we end up in the Stadiums? Will my
          kids ever have a chance? Will it
          get better? Or will it be worse?

                    INTERVIEWER
          And how do you intend to answer
          those questions?

                    NOAH
          The Eucharist wants the few public
          goods that remain to not be bought
          by corporations, cheapened, and
          sold for profit back to those who
          desperately need them. Because
          that’s what’s been happening.

Noah is impassioned, whether sincere or not, he’s turning it
on perfectly.
                                                                  26.


                           NOAH (CONT’D)
                 I’m mean we’ve sold our schools,
                 our healthcare, our water, our
                 police, our child services, our
                 Medicare. Let us have a damn park.

       Mirah almost fist pumps behind the cameras. She can hear ‘let
       us have a damn park’ trending on social media.

                           NOAH (CONT’D)
                 And then, we start taking back some
                 of the other things and give them
                 to the people again too. Because
                 despite what the markets seem to
                 believe, the value of America is in
                 its people not its things.

                           INTERVIEWER
                 These are big ideas, but where can
                 you start with something like this?

                           NOAH
                 We start by actually talking to The
                 Eucharist, rather than vilifying
                 them. Which is why I’m holding a
                 campaign event in Central Park.

       The Interviewer is surprised -- we’ve seen the footage of
       Central Park. She turns to Alex:

                           INTERVIEWER
                 Mr. Teller, how do you feel about
                 this?

       He’s hurt. Noah put him in a an impossible spot, forcing him
       to agree while they’re on air.

                            ALEX
                 My husband is a remarkable man who
                 wants to fight for every American.
                     (then)
                 I’m proud of him.

       Alex bites his teeth and smiles... waiting for the painful
       seconds to tick by until he can get the fuck off camera.


1.27   INT. SOFIA’S CONDO - NIGHT                                 1.27

       Sofia sets down a scotch glass on an open piece of mail.

                           JACK
                 Fuck your investors for this. You
                 should appeal.
                                                               27.


       INSERT PIECE OF MAIL --
       Prodigy Market Investor Request
           Request: Psychological Exam
           Investor Vote: 87% vote in favor of the exam
           Please report to...

                           SOFIA (O.S.)
                 They got a lot of money tied up in
                 me. I get it.

       We don’t have time to read the rest before brown liquid is
       splashed into the glass.

                           SOFIA (CONT’D)
                 Just wish they didn’t have to put
                 on a dog and pony show to justify
                 their sell off.

                           JACK
                 There’s no reason for them to sell.

       Jack lights a cigarette in his mouth and hands it to her.

                           SOFIA
                 They’re afraid. But they’ll sell a
                 little and feel a little better. It
                 hurts, but I can survive.

       Before Jack responds:

       RING. RING. Sofia looks at a screen in their living room to
       see who’s calling --

          It’s Kate.


1.28   EXT. PARKING LOT - NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT      1.28

       Sofia steps out of the backseat of another driverless black
       car and toward the ivy-covered exterior of the old library.

                           KATE (V.O.)
                 I love this library.

       Sofia pushes through the old, oak doors--


1.29   INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT                    1.29

       Only feet into the library, she’s stopped by a turnstile and
       a computer with instructions.

                           SOFIA (V.O.)
                 Smells like mildew.
                                                               28.


       Sofia stops to swipe her credit card before she’s allowed to
       enter the library... it’s no longer a public good.


1.30   INT. HEART OF THE LIBRARY - LATER                       1.30

       Sofia and Kate walk through mazes of bookshelves stretching
       toward the ceiling. Dusty. A familiar ghost town that feels
       like a relic of the past encompasses the women.

                           KATE
                 It was built in 1897; it’s allowed
                 to have a little stink. Been alive
                 longer than any human on the face
                 of the Earth.

       Sofia thinks about that for a beat.

                           SOFIA
                 Still stinks.

       Kate laughs.    THEN:

                           KATE
                 I think I want to do it.

                               SOFIA
                 Ok. Good.

                           KATE
                 But. Do you regret it?

                           SOFIA
                 I wouldn’t be selling it to you if
                 I regretted it.

                           KATE
                 Some people would.

       Sofia smiles.

                           SOFIA
                 You’re too young      to remember, but
                 there was a time      when regular
                 people had jobs.      I mean, look at
                 your dad, what’d      he run, five, six
                 hotels?

                               KATE
                 Six.

                           SOFIA
                 My mom was the chief mechanic at a
                 dealership.
                           (MORE)
                                                        29.

                     SOFIA (CONT'D)
          It was hard work, but she was able
          to put a few bucks of every
          paycheck towards a better future
          for me, and so, she loved that job.
              (then)
          But after the crash my better
          future had to pay the rent instead
          of Stanford. It’s ok, I’ll go to a
          cheaper state school, I said. Nope.
          The States need money so they sell
          the schools to Veritas Private
          Equity who jack up tuition. Ok, I
          said, student loans. Nope. The Fed
          can’t afford the loans now that
          tuition’s up.

Sofia shakes her head and laughs at the absurdity of that.

                    SOFIA (CONT’D)
          The world before was almost
          impossible, but there was still a
          ladder to climb. However rickety it
          was. Then, the ladder was finally
          smashed to fucking bits and there
          was only one shitty rung left. So I
          jumped up and grabbed it. And
          that’s what I used to climb up. So
          no, I don’t regret it.

                    KATE
          Have you ever felt like your
          investors forced your hand? Made
          choices for you?

                     SOFIA
          No.

Off Kate’s look:


                    SOFIA (CONT’D)
          Look, if I had tried to quit my job
          to become a freelance poet, sure,
          maybe they’d make me get a salary.
          But as long as you’re working, your
          investors are happy.

                    KATE
          What about you? Are you happy?

And there it is.   The age old question.

                    SOFIA
          Am I happy? What is happy?
                                                        30.


                    KATE
          Are you satisfied?

                    SOFIA
          Never. I’ll run until I’m dead. But
          that has nothing to do with the
          market.

                    KATE
          So why would I want to do that with
          my life?

                    SOFIA
              (re: running)
          Because I’m in great fucking shape.

                    KATE
          I’m not though. I’m not sure if I’m
          ready to deal with investors or
          even worse, those psychoanalysis
          sessions.

Sofia smiles like its no big deal.

                    SOFIA
          Those are nothing. Something
          stressful happens, I go to a
          psychiatrist. That’s all.

                    KATE
          You go to a psychiatrist or you’re
          forced to go?

                    SOFIA
          I’m asked to go.

                    KATE
          And if you don’t?

Sofia writes something on a piece of paper and hands it to
Kate.

                    SOFIA
          The shrink sessions are closed to
          non-investors, but if you really
          want to see what it’s like, tune
          in. They’re not that scary.

Kate takes the paper and thinks.
                                                               31.


                           KATE
                     (stating the obvious)
                 Even if I decide to do this, I
                 don’t have another Liquid Natural
                 Gas in my back pocket.

                           SOFIA
                 Let’s see what the bank can do.

                           KATE
                 I signed a contract.

                           SOFIA
                 Come on now, Kate. Do you how
                 easily paper can be torn?

       Kate digests it all.

                           KATE
                 You would do this? If you were me?

                           SOFIA
                 I already was you.

       Sofia smiles.

                           SOFIA (CONT’D)
                 Me and you? We weren’t born
                 inheriting the Earth. We have to go
                 out there, and we have to take it.

       As Sofia packs up her things to leave. She stops.

                           SOFIA (CONT’D)
                 And Kate? I lied that night at the
                 talent show. There’s no one out
                 there as special as you.


1.31   EXT. MET LIFE STADIUM - NIGHT                           1.31

       The stadium is defunct. Abandoned cars, shopping carts, and
       tent fires punctuate the vacant parking lots.

       A man in sleek joggers, blue surgeon’s gloves, and a hoodie
       pulled tight around his skull walks past.

       Straight up to the stadium and through the unguarded gates.
                                                                  32.


1.32   INSIDE MET LIFE STADIUM                                    1.32

       He is absorbed into a bustling but impoverished community.
       Tents line the hallways. Crates form makeshift bodegas.
       Everything you need or want can be bought or traded for.

       As the man works his way to higher floors past families, drug
       addicts, and prostitutes, we circle to his front--

       His face is covered by a surgeon’s mask and his eyes are
       mirrored with contact lenses.

       He walks up to an old club-box guarded by armed men and hands
       one a folded piece of paper sealed with black wax.

       The guard breaks the wax seal and inspects. He nods toward
       the door; the other guard lowers his gun.

       MIRRORED-EYED-MAN walks past them and into --


1.33   THE CLUB-BOX                                               1.33

       It’s a mini-world of luxury, stark contrast to outside. An
       executive office you would’ve expected at Bear Stearns.

       The Mirrored-Eyed-Man is approached by a woman who people
       call CHARLIE (40), but it’s probably not her name. She
       carries around a bowl of salad and eats it with her hands.

                           CHARLIE
                 You can take off the mask in here.
                 We’re not doing DNA sweeps or
                 retinal scans.

       The man hands her a manila envelope. Charlie sets down her
       salad and licks her fingers clean before grabbing it.

                           CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                 And you can talk, too. We can be,
                 uhh, maybe not real friends, but we
                 can be work friends.

       The Mirrored-Eyed-Man just extends a hand - expectantly.

                           CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                 Alright. You do you.

       Charlie smacks an envelope of cash in his palm.   He counts.

                           CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                 Remember, the most important thing
                 is that you have fun.
                                                                  33.


       The Masked Man says nothing, stuffs the cash in his hoodie
       and heads out as quickly as he came.

       Charlie takes the manila envelope she got from the Masked Man
       and uses a candle to drip some black wax on the edge.

       She stamps it.

       CLOSE UP ON THE WORDS: The Underbelly imprinted in the seal.

                           CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                 Hey, big guy. I need you to deliver
                 this.

       She hands one of her guards the envelope.

                                                       MATCH CUT:


1.34   THE MANILA ENVELOPE                                        1.34

       Still sealed shut with black wax. Hands fiddle with the edges
       like they’re debating opening it. Hands that belong to--

       ETHER

       He sits next to Vera, the Fed Chair, in--


1.35   INT. BLACK CAR - NIGHT                                     1.35

       Driverless. Luxurious.

                           VERA
                 You don’t have to open it.

       Ether ignores the advice and peels open the envelope. He
       pulls out the contents.

       INSERT: A photo of Robert in his bed. Vomit on his cheek and
       pillow. Needle in his arm. Dead.

                           VERA (CONT’D)
                 You did the right thing.

                           ETHER
                 I hope so because it doesn’t
                 fucking feel like it.

                           VERA
                 The feeling will go away.

       Vera removes her wig and scratches her bald scalp underneath.
       The wig no longer hides what the chemo has done to her.
                                                           34.


                    VERA (CONT’D)
          You know the consequences if we
          didn’t do it. This little
          experiment we call The United
          States comes to a screeching,
          fucking halt.

                    ETHER
          Robert knew that. He still thought
          that’d be better than what we’re
          doing.

Vera takes a large pill from her purse. Swallows without
water.

                     VERA
          Not to be cold, but Robert already
          lost his family. He didn’t have
          anyone to worry about. We have
          daughters and grandkids who have to
          inherit the world we give them.
              (then)
          I don’t want to be doing what we
          have to do any more than you, but
          here we are.

                    ETHER
          You’ve given that speech before,
          hmm?

Ether takes the photo back and stuffs it into the envelope.
He takes a lighter and sets the whole packet on fire.

                    VERA
          I give it to myself. Every night.

The car stops. As Ether rolls down the window and throws the
flaming packet out, Vera puts her wig back on just before--

Vera’s door is opened by a flight attendant. Her carry-on
ready and a private jet waiting.


EXT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Old money in the big city. A regarded establishment of
education holding the Senatorial Debate.

                    DEBATE MODERATOR (V.O.)
          And that’s all for the second
          debate for New York’s hotly
          contested Senate seat.
                                                        35.


INT. SENATE DEBATE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Noah Teller waves at a cheering crowd from behind his podium.

                    DEBATE MODERATOR
          Thank you to the candidates, New
          York University, and Veritas
          Education Group.

Noah crosses the stage to shake hands with Senator Rodgers,
who returns with a warm smile.

                                                  CUT TO:


BACK STAGE HALLWAY

                    NOAH
          Lie all you want, but don’t go out
          there and say I’m promoting
          violence when I’m the only one
          trying to listen.

                    SENATOR RODGERS
          You promote a violent group, Noah.
          Therefore, you promote violence.

                    NOAH
          And what’s your plan: carpet
          bombing Central Park?

                    SENATOR RODGERS
          My plan is to get elected. The way
          you’re running your campaign,
          that’s apparently not yours.

Noah grinds his teeth. He wants to rip this guy’s tongue out
but isn’t going to take the bait.

                    SENATOR RODGERS (CONT’D)
          Let’s be honest: you’re an amateur.

                      NOAH
          Fuck you.

                      SENATOR RODGERS
          See.

Noah is pissed at himself for reacting.

                    SENATOR RODGERS (CONT’D)
          I’m up double digits because I know
          what to care about and what not to.
          You?
                    (MORE)
                                                                  36.

                           SENATOR RODGERS (CONT’D)
                 You’re all worked up about
                 everything. Including a bunch
                 violent extremists.

                           NOAH
                 They should matter.

                            SENATOR RODGERS
                 They should. They don’t.
                     (then)
                 Goodnight, Noah.

       The Senator turns and walks away.


1.37   INT. PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - PREP ROOM - CONTINUOUS          1.37

       In a small room, Sofia stands naked, hands above her head
       like she’s going through airport security.

       A scanner moves down the wall and the lights turn green.

       Sofia puts her clothes back on. But before she puts her
       shirt on, she takes a heart monitor from a table and wraps it
       around her chest

                           PSYCHIATRIST (O.S.)
                 How do you feel losing your mentor?

       She puts her shirt on and then attaches two electrodes to her
       temples and a monitor on her left pointer finger.

                             SOFIA (O.S.)
                 Not good.


       INT. PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - DAY

       Sofia sits in a chair facing a screen with a smiling
       PSYCHIATRIST looking back at her. The electrodes and finger
       monitors are connected to jacks on the wall.

                           PSYCHIATRIST
                 Can you tell me a little bit more?

       Sofia moves in her seat, uncomfortable.

                            SOFIA
                 It’s really hard to tell which
                 emotion it is. Sometimes it feels
                 like confusion, sometimes fear.
                     (then)
                 I prefer when it feels like fear.
                            (MORE)
                                                        37.

                    SOFIA (CONT'D)
          At least that’s a productive
          emotion.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          Why do you say that?

                    SOFIA
          Sadness shuts the body down. Fear
          makes you push harder.

                       PSYCHIATRIST
          At work?

                    SOFIA
          At work. At home. Everywhere I
          guess.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          And do you expect your mentor’s
          death to impact your career?

                    SOFIA
          He’s not just my mentor.

The Psychiatrist lets the moment hang...

                    SOFIA (CONT’D)
          Can we just call him Bobby?

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          Will Bobby’s death impact your
          career?

                       SOFIA
          No.

BEEP.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          Our monitors suggest that is likely
          a lie.

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. MOTEL SIX - DAY

On the old laptop, wearing headphones under the covers, Kate
watches the interview. In the lower left corner of the
screen, we can see she’s viewer 1,967...

                    SOFIA (ON VIDEO)
          Ok. I’m concerned how I’ll fare
          without him.
                                                          38.


...and on the right corner of the screen, we see a downward
sloping graph:

   Asset            --   SKO791IIV
   Price            --   $286.87
   Daily Change     --   -$7.46 (-2.83%)
   Monthly Change   --   -26.22 (-7.17%)
   Annual Change    --   -70.08 (-17.06%)

All RED. But what’s important this time is we realize we are
looking at Sofia’s Prodigy Market value that she’s been
obsessing over and it’s now plummeting with every ounce of
humanity.

                    SOFIA (CONT’D)
          He gave me the courage to take
          chances. Normally, people like me
          can’t even contemplate change, let
          alone chance.

                    PSYCHIATRIST (O.S.)
          You don’t think you had the
          opportunity to take chances?

                    SOFIA
          No. If I were to slip up, even a
          little, who could protect me? Or
          help. Even if they wanted to.

This is the most still we’ve seen Sofia.

                    SOFIA (CONT’D)
          No one until Bobby. Suddenly, I
          could take big swings. And you know
          what? I hit them. Most of the time,
          I fucking nailed them. But I could
          only do that because of him.

The enormity of Robert’s death washes over Sofia.

                    SOFIA (CONT’D)
          The truth is, I don’t know what my
          career looks like without Bobby. I
          don’t know what my life looks like
          without him. But all I can do is
          keep moving and find out.

The Psychiatrist looks at the monitor. No BEEP.

                                                    BACK TO:

KATE’S BEDROOM
                                                           39.


Kate stares at her Prodigy Market application; she hears her
dad COUGH through the thin partition; he’s right there. Right
there as she --

Uses the touchpad to forge his signature.

CLICKS SUBMIT.

And closes her laptop. It’s done.


INT. BLACK CAR - DAY

Post psychiatrist appointment, Sofia and Jack sit across from
each other in the car.

                    JACK
          You did good. Great.

Sofia’s mind hasn’t stopped racing since she had to talk
about Robert’s death.

                    SOFIA
          He was fine. That night on the
          roof. In the meeting. On our walk.
          He was fine. He was sober. For a
          long time. No back slides.
              (pause)
          And then?

                    JACK
          You have no idea what was going
          through his head. Behind closed
          doors.

Sophia GAZES out the window, THINKS, NODS. Jack’s not wrong.
And still?

                     SOFIA
          Kate said some random thing to me
          at the library. Said it was older
          than anybody else on Earth. Like it
          was alive.
              (then)
          1913-2038. The memo on the $1 wire.
          You remember that?

                    JACK
          Yeah. But it’s just a weird thing,
          Sof. Nothing more.

                    SOFIA
          The Federal Reserve was started in
          1913.
                                                                  40.


       Jack processes what Sofia is suggesting.

                              JACK
                    You think Bobby was saying it will
                    end this year? What would that even
                    mean?

       Beat.

                              SOFIA
                    The end of the Federal Reserve is
                    the end of the modern economy. It’s
                    an institution that’s not supposed
                    to die. That’s the whole point.

       Jack’s face shows confusion and concern.

                              SOFIA (CONT’D)
                    I know, it’s ridiculous. Forget it.

       She may believe that it’s ridiculous, but we know she’s not
       going to be able to forget it.


1.41   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY                                      1.41

       In silence.

       Oliver sits immovable in one of the shitty, plastic chairs.
       Elbows on his knees, staring at nothing. Definitely not
       looking at--

       Kate, so far on the edge of the other chair she could be
       kneeling in front of her dad. Begging for forgiveness.

       Finally...

                              OLIVER
                    I’m going to submit a claim. You
                    forged my signature. It’ll
                    invalidate --

                              KATE
                    You can’t do (that, Dad) --

                              OLIVER
                    Why the hell not?

                              KATE
                        (barely a whisper)
                    It’s fraud. I committed fraud. If
                    you turn me in...
                                                                  41.


       Oliver digests that but has nothing to say. Still never
       looking at his daughter. He can’t.

                           KATE (CONT’D)
                 I just... this was our only option.
                 And it’s a good one. We have money
                 now. Money that we need and it’s
                 just 15%.

       Oliver doesn’t react. There’s nothing she can say that would
       ever convince him otherwise.

                           KATE (CONT’D)
                 Please, Dad. I was just trying to
                 help. I don’t want you to struggle.
                 You shouldn’t... I’m sorry.

       Oliver finally looks at Kate, but it’s the way someone with
       Alzheimer’s looks at the ones they used to love... searching
       for recognition that isn’t there.

                           OLIVER
                 I’m not angry at you.

       He pushes himself up from the cheap chair.

                           OLIVER (CONT’D)
                 I just need to go for a walk.

       He heads to the door and leaves without another word.

       Kate is crushed. So drained from the disappointment that she
       can’t find the energy for emotion. She stumbles to her room
       and reaches for her computer when she spots something--

       INSERT - The Pamphlet from The Eucharist

       --sits among a small pile of papers on her desk. The
       provocative “Fear is Good” slogan asking her to open it.

       She takes it and flips through.


1.42   INT. ETHER’S OFFICE - DAY                                  1.42

       Sofia enters and Ether looks up from his massive desk in his
       massive office.

                           ETHER
                 Sofia--

       Ether motions toward the couch. She sits, leaving the office
       door cracked just a bit.
                                                        42.


                    ETHER (CONT’D)
          I got your email. It’s not the
          right time.

                    SOFIA
          I understand.

                       ETHER
          Thank you.

Sofia adjusts and then:

                    SOFIA
          You know, I figured out what
          Robert’s wire means.

Ether pushes his screens aside to look directly at Sofia.

                    ETHER
          For someone with a multibillion-
          dollar portfolio, you’re awfully
          obsessed with a one dollar
          transaction.

                    SOFIA
          I think we should file a report
          with the SEC.

                    ETHER
          And my doctor thinks I should get a
          colonoscopy, but I don’t like
          people snooping around my shit.

                    SOFIA
          If Robert was involved in
          something, or on to someone, we
          should be out ahead of it. An SEC
          investigation will put (us ahead--)

                    ETHER
          Sofia, dear, the SEC doesn’t
          investigate on a buck and hunch.

                    SOFIA
          Someone at the Fed worked with
          someone at this company to hide
          suspicious account activity from a
          dead, high-ranking bank executive.

                    ETHER
          Have you heard of the term
          confirmation bias? Because before
          you continue to jeopardize your
          future, I would look it up.
                                                           43.


                    SOFIA
          That dead executive called the Fed
          Chair thirteen times the week
          before his death.

This is it. Sofia’s going to burn the fucking system to the
ground.

                    ETHER
          And how exactly do you know that?

                    SOFIA
          Its amazing how easy it is to get
          details about someone when you have
          all of their passwords in life.

She keeps going.

                    ETHER
          So what? He’s a banker calling the
          Fed.

                    SOFIA
          Fed Chair. On her personal cell.
          Thirteen times. In a week.

                       ETHER
                 (what’s your point)
          And?

                    SOFIA
          And eleven of those times he looped
          you into the call. Now I don’t know
          exactly what the fuck is going on,
          but I think an investigation might
          help shine a little light.

Ether takes just a moment to decide his next move. Then:

                    ETHER
          You’re about to ruin a career you
          worked very hard for.

Sofia doesn’t flinch.

                    SOFIA
          Fine. Let’s make all of these
          questions disappear.

Ether gets it. Does the audience yet?

                    ETHER
          What do you want?
                                                        44.


We do now. This is the moment we realize Sofia isn’t going to
burn it down. She’s going to find the next, shitty rung on
the ladder to pull herself up further.

                    SOFIA
          I want Robert’s position: pay,
          title, responsibility.

                    ETHER
          And you want a Prodigy Trading
          Division for the bank.

Sofia swallows, barely noticeable.

                    ETHER (CONT’D)
          What would Robert think of that?

                    SOFIA
          It doesn’t matter what Robert
          thinks. What do you think? Is it
          worth an SEC investigation?

Ether clears his throat and smiles, a tiny indication that
Sofia has him cornered.

                    ETHER
          I’m not the most powerful man in
          the world, but I’m pretty fucking
          close, and you’re willing to
          threaten me for what? For the bank
          to buy equity in some kids.

Ether shakes his head thinking about it.

                    ETHER (CONT’D)
          Are you sure you don’t want to
          rewind the clock to five minutes
          ago? Because we can still do that.

                    SOFIA
          We both know I can’t. Not anymore.

Ether nods... so be it.

                    ETHER
          Well then, let me be the first to
          congratulate you on your new
          position and new division.

                    SOFIA
          Thank you, sir.

As Sofia gets up to leave, Ether stops her.
                                                                 45.


                           ETHER
                 A piece of advice now that you’re
                 in the big leagues. If you’re going
                 to make threats, you better be
                 perfect. Absolutely perfect.

                           SOFIA
                 You know what, while we’re giving
                 advice, I have a little for you.

       Ether stares at her. Cold.

                           SOFIA (CONT’D)
                 You think right now that an SEC
                 investigation is the worst thing
                 that can happen, but I assure you,
                 the worst thing that can happen to
                 you is me turning up dead. Ok?

       Ether heaves himself up and walks right past Sofia to the
       door. He grabs the handle, but before he opens--

                           ETHER
                 It’s funny. Not too long ago, a
                 dead guy told me the exact same
                 thing.

       And then he opens the door. It’s time for her to leave.


1.43   INT. CAR - DAY                                            1.43

       Noah and Mirah sit in a driverless car together, passing a
       sea of protestors in Central Park.

       We can hear the chaos, but can’t make out what’s being
       screamed at his car as they pass.

                           MIRAH
                 You don’t have to do this.

       picks up on the other end.

                 We’ve got a problem.

INT. CLUB BOX - MET LIFE STADIUM - DAY

Charlie hands a fresh envelope to the Mirrored-Eyed-Man. He

Ether holds his head in stress.

                    VERA (ON PHONE)
          You think it’s her husband with the
          information? We can fix that.

Ether doesn’t like the implications.

                    ETHER
          I think she’s too smart for that.

                    VERA (ON PHONE)
          Smart people make mistakes.

                    ETHER
          We’re pretty fucking smart. Let’s
          not make any.

Ether hangs up --

EXT. NOAH’S HOME - DAY

The Mirrored-Eyed-Man hurries to a back door. A “Vote for
Noah Teller” flag proudly waves above the home.

The Mirrored-Eyed-Man steps into the kitchen. He takes a
pistol with a silencer and lays it gently on the island.

Just as we think the Mirrored-Eyed-Man is here for a hit on
Noah, he lowers his hoodie, strips off the surgeon’s mask,
and removes mirrored contacts.

It’s Alex. A hitman.

Noah rolls down the window. Just an inch, and suddenly we can
make out the chant.
                                                           47.


                    PROTESTERS
          Fuck You Teller.
              (clap clap clap-clap-clap)
          Fuck You Teller.

Noah rolls the window back up.

                    NOAH
          May I have my phone?

INT. NOAH’S HOME - BASEMENT - DAY

Naked, Alex dissolves his clothes, mask, and gloves in a
plastic bin of acid.

His phone next to him vibrates: Noah. It sits next to the
envelope sealed with black wax.

                                                  CUT TO:


EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

DEAFENING. From inside the chaos.

Protesters thrusts signs into the air:

    - Photo of Noah with a red-X across his face;
    - A spoofed Noah poster that says “America for Me”;
    - Noah’s graduation picture with “Fuck R.E.A.s”

                    NOAH (V.O.)
          Hey babe, umm, I just...
              (changes his mind)
          I was thinking this Saturday we
          should order take out. Spend the
          whole day in bed.

The protestors are barely contained by a perimeter of
threatening guards.

Alex removes bricks under their staircase that reveals a
hidden safe.
                                                                 48.


                           NOAH (V.O.)
                 We can watch all those shitty
                 dating shows you can’t get enough
                 of. Drink wine. Make up for a lot
                 of missed weekends lately.

       Alex opens up the safe -- it’s full of surgeon masks, gloves,
       and black joggers.

       Before he places the sealed envelope inside, he pulls out the
       picture of his next hit: SOFIA.

                                                          BACK TO:


       INT. NOAH'S CAR - DAY

                           NOAH
                     (from the bottom of his
                      heart)
                 I love you.

       Noah kisses the phone and hangs up.

       He smiles at Mirah, and as the door opens, the sound of his
       name being chanted envelops him: Fuck you Teller. Fuck you
       Teller.

       Kate watches the thousands of Eucharist Members in Central
       Park -- Manhattan skyscrapers shadowing them in the distance.
       She heads toward the entrance.

       EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

       Kate goes deeper and deeper into the crowds of people in all
       camo with red-X’s across their chests.

       The thick crowd is suffocating. It’s like pushing to the
       front of a massive, hostile concert.

       Noah walks directly into the crowd.

       Bundles of fake-cash, president’s face masks, and empty cans
       of spray paint are thrown at him. Noah keeps his chest up and
       a hand raised to block things from hitting him in the face.

       Sofia stares at her computer, contemplating the first
       investment ever made by a major bank on the Prodigy Market.

       She clicks over to a new window:

       INSERT COMPUTER SCREEN:

                    Annual Change    --   +59.19 (+13.06%)

       That bright green graph showing a huge jump in Sofia’s value.
       She’s worth the most she’s ever been. She PAUSES --

       PROTESTER 1 holds out a camo sweatshirt.

                           PROTESTER 1
                 You with us?

       PSHHHH. PSHHHH. A red X is spray painted across the chest and
       then it gets handed to Kate, who holds it in her hands and
       stares at the red-X that looks right back at her.
                                                                  50.


       Kate debating. Should she wear it?    She PAUSES --

       As Noah PAUSES --

       This is the time. This is the place.

       We pull back and see thousands of people all circled around
       Noah. Right now, they’re ready to kill him. But he has their
       attention.

                                                             CUT TO:

       Sofia glances briefly at the photo that Ether gifted, of her
       and Robert, accepting the award.

       She clicks back over to Kate’s Prodigy page; hits CONFIRM.

       And just like that, Kate becomes Sofia’s asset.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK.
