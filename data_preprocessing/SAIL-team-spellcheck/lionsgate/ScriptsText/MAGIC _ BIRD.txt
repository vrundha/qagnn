FADE IN:

On the ROAR OF A CROWD. It’s screaming inside --


INT. RUPP ARENA - NIGHT

Home of the Kentucky Wildcats. A PACKED HOUSE watching a
BASKETBALL GAME in full swing. The (predominantly white) USA
JUNIOR NATIONAL TEAM running circles around RUSSIA as --

A TITLE CARD READS: WORLD INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT
                      LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY - 1978

The best college players on the planet are in this gym only --
they aren’t on the court. They are riding the bench.

                     MAGIC
           You believe this shit, man.

Seated on the bench, watching the game pass them by, are:
LARRY BIRD (21) and EARVIN “MAGIC” JOHNSON (19).

Larry, of course, is the tall, white, bowl cut, acne-scarred,
porn stashed, backwoods, “Hick from French Lick” and --

Magic, obviously, is the black, 6’9”, megawatt supernova with
a Hollywood smile and talent and charisma to burn.

Quite a pair. Both disgruntled, unused to riding the pin.

                     MAGIC (CONT’D)
           Every time coach takes us out,
           these cats start coming back. What
           the fuck is he doing?

                     LARRY
           He don’t care about us. Just wants
           to work out his guys. Couldn’t pay
           me to play for Coach Hall at UK.

                     MAGIC
           Yeah? What’d he do to you?

                     LARRY
           Told my high school coach I was too
           slow to play big time college ball.

                     MAGIC
           That was four years ago? -- Remind
           me not to get on your bad side.

                     LARRY
           I mean just look what he’s running.
                                                            2.


They watch the game on the court. It’s not quite 1950’s, set-
shot, white ball, but it’s not too far off.

                    LARRY (CONT’D)
          He wouldn’t know an ace player if
          one punched him in the face.

That gets a laugh out of Magic when --

                    COACH HALL
          Come on! Bird. Johnson. Get in.

COACH JOHN B. HALL (40’s), the asshole is question, waves our
two heroes in. Magic turns to Larry at the scorer’s table.

                    MAGIC
          Wanna show this fool something?

Magic flashes a smile as they’re buzzed into the game and
what happens next is the stuff of basketball legend. The
black and white game suddenly jumps into color.

They are on defense at first and when a Russian shot bricks,
Larry snags the rebound one handed, firing on an overhand
bullet all the way down to court that hits Magic in stride
for a break-away dunk that gets the crowd on their feet.

Magic’s chance next. He pushes the pace on the break, drawing
three defenders at once, tripping all over each other when --

Magic fires a no-look missile to Larry cutting down for a
layup that leaves the Ruskie's on skates and --

When they run the break together, it’s lightning in a bottle.

Magic drives past three defenders, flying down the left
block, dropping a no-look dime over his shoulder to --

Larry, cutting hard down the lane. It’s only on his hands for
an instant, drawing the last two defenders before --

He dishes it no-look back to Magic for a wide open lay-up and
the CROWD goes berserk. So does Magic. Pure joy. He gives
Bird a high-five. A taste of what could have been. But the
moment is fleeting and --

A SHORT WHILE LATER

It’s over. The US has won. The teams shaking hands as the
MEDIA descends, trying to wrangle the stars.

                    REPORTER
          Hey Magic. Great game. Can you talk
          for a minute?
                                                            3.


                    MAGIC
          Yeah. Let’s get Larry. Hold on.
              (looking over crowds)
          Where the hell did he go?

Because Larry’s already leaving, slipping off the court, out
of the glare of the spotlights. Magic can’t comprehend.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          Well, I guess it’s just me.

Magic turns back to the cameras, lights up his smile as -

We end on Larry, dipping out on the celebration, disappearing
alone into the dark of tunnel as we --

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

A TITLE CARD READS: THREE YEARS EARLIER

FADE BACK IN ON:


EXT. FRENCH LICK STREETS - MORNING

A GARBAGE TRUCK rumbling down an impoverished dirt road in a
poor, rural farming town of 8,000 people that makes Hoosiers
look like it was shot in Manhattan.

TITLE CARD READS:   FRENCH LICK, INDIANA

We follow the truck, rumbling past abandoned farms and two
room clapboard houses. A worker hanging on the back.

It’s Larry Bird (19), wearing a STREET DEPT. UNIFORM like
Martin Sheen in Badlands. When the truck stops at a house --

Larry hops off and heaves trash into the back of the truck
with his friend, KEVIN KEARNS (20). Hard, backbreaking work
that Larry doesn’t mind. Once they’ve dumped all the cans --

Larry jumps back on as the truck pulls off again and --


EXT. OTHER FRENCH LICK STREETS - DAY (VARIOUS SHOTS)

Larry and Kearns haul trash through their entire poor, little
town until they reach the final house.

After the last bag is tossed, Larry spots a CAN on the ground
and he shoots it like a three into the back of the truck and -
                                                         4.


EXT. BARN, FRENCH LICK - AFTERNOON

Now that the trash work is done, Larry and Kearn put up BALES
OF HAY in a barn. Another back-breaking job that tears your
arms up to shreds.

Larry puts up a thousand in the heat of the sun and --


EXT. STREET DEPT. WAREHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

The work day’s finally done. The truck parked in the
warehouse, Larry heads out the door.

                    KEARNS
          Hey Birdie, you want a beer?

Kearns hands him a CHAMPAGNE VELVET BEER (Indiana local piss-
cheap beer) from the back of his CAR and they cheers.

                    KEARNS (CONT’D)
          You want a ride to your grandma’s?

                    LARRY
          That’s ok, gonna walk. See you
          later tonight.

                    KEARNS
          Hope you ain’t too tired to play.

Larry flips him the bird, walking off with his beer toward --


EXT. LIZZIE KERN’S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

A tiny, though well kept, one-story clapboard house beside a
railroad track where --

Larry’s approaching, having walked for a mile. He takes his
last sip of beer, tossing it shattering across the tines of
tracks and then heads through the door into --


INT. LIZZIE KERNS’ HOUSE. THAT MOMENT

Larry’s grandmother’s house. His sports trophies everywhere,
alongside family photos Larry’s FOUR BROTHERS and SISTER.

Larry enters to find his grandmother, LIZZIE KEARNS, opening
mail in the kitchen. Lizzie’s 60. Loving. A straight shooter.

                    LIZZIE
          How was work? You want something
          for dinner?
                                                            5.


                    LIZZIE (CONT’D)
          You want something for dinner?

                    LARRY
          No thanks. Gotta game. Just came by
          for my things.

                    LIZZIE
          Know who’s going to be there
          tonight, don’t ya?

She produces a letter. The return address reads: INDIANA
STATE UNIVERSITY.

                    LARRY
              (sarcastic)
          Wonder how he found me?

                    LIZZIE
              (cuts him a look)
          Your mother’s just trying to help.
          I don’t want to get in the middle,
          but at least talk to her, Larry.

                    LARRY
          What do you want me to say? I told
          her before, I ain’t going back to
          school. I’m too happy right here.
          That way I get to see you.

Larry gives her a kiss, heading into his stark, fastidiously
clean bedroom to retrieve his basketball gear when --

He pauses for a moment, noticing a PHOTOGRAPH IN THE ROOM:

A buzzed-cut young Larry posing proudly with his father, JOE
BIRD. A Johnny Cash look-alike, only taller and tougher.

Larry regards it for a moment, until A CAR HONKS outside,
breaking his reverie. He heads back out the door.

                    LIZZIE
          Don’t come home, you don’t win.

He laughs as he goes, leaving Lizzie shaking her head and ---


INT. MARK’S ‘64 CHEVY - EVENING (A FEW MOMENTS LATER)

MARK BIRD (Larry’s brother, 22) is at the wheel while Larry
changes into his uniform beside him. Silence. Larry knows.
                                                         6.


                    LARRY
          Don’t start in on me too. You came
          back home for college, same as me.

                    MARK
          Yeah, only difference, I finished.
          I don’t know if you heard, but it
          takes more than 10 days.

                    LARRY
          That true? I’ll be damned. Why
          didn’t somebody tell me?

The brothers laugh. Always bullshitting.

                    LARRY (CONT’D)
          ‘Sides, I go back, you won’t have
          any friends so just shut up and
          drive. I don’t wanna be late.

                    MARK
          You asked for it. Fine.

And Marks steps on the gas, kicking up dirt on the road and --


EXT. WEST BADEN HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

Mark’s car finally arrives in a lot packed with pick-ups and
Chevy’s for an AAU Game. The biggest show in a small town.

Before Mark’s even parked, Larry runs for the doors into -


INT. WEST BADEN HIGH SCHOOL GYM - THAT MOMENT

A packed gym. Right out of Hoosiers. On court, a local AAU
TEAM getting their asses smacked by an INDIANA ALL-STAR TEAM.

                    CROWD
          Goddamn it! C’mon!

The whole town is here. EIGHT HUNDRED WORKING CLASS LOCALS,
fed-up with their team. The only hint of outsiders --

TWO SHARP DRESSERS IN SUITS sitting apart in the stands. In a
beat, we’ll learn they’re:

INDIANA STATE HEAD COACH, BOB KING and more importantly, his
assistant, BILL HODGES (35, kind, and plain spoken.)

                    BOB KING
          This is a waste of my time. Where
          the hell is this kid?
                                                           7.


                    BILL HODGES
          His mom said he would be here. Just
          hold on. Here he comes!

The whole crowd starts to buzz as Larry enters the gym,
hurrying over to his bench and his coach.

                    LARRY
          Sorry I’m late. Had to wait for a
          ride.

                    AAU COACH
          Do you need to warm up or...?

                    LARRY
          No. I’m ready. Let’s go.

Larry heads to the scorers table, wiping the bottom of his
shoes with the palms of his hands in a ritual of his.

                    BOB KING
          That’s your white knight? Kid looks
          like a scarecrow. No wonder he did
          not last two weeks with Bob Knight.
          Can he even get off the floor?

                    BILL HODGES
          Just wait and you’ll see.

He won’t have to wait long, because as soon as Larry checks
in the game, King’s skepticism is vanquished.

On the very first play, Larry picks the shifty POINT GUARD’S
pocket and takes it in for a left handed lay-up.

Hodges gives his head coach a look as --

OVER THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF QUARTERS:

Larry puts on a display that leaves jaws on the floor.

He runs power-point, dropping behind the back dimes. He
crashes the boards with a stunning sixth sense. He dives
after lose balls and shit talks bigger players and --

Of course, Larry drops j’s from such ingenious angles that --

Bob King is left gawking. Watching a savant playing chess
when everyone else’s playing checkers. He turns to Hodges.

                    BOB KING
          Why isn’t this kid in college?
          We need to get him to Terre Haute.
                                                            8.


EXT. POOL HALL, WEST BADEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Larry and Kearns play pool in a grim little joint that looks
out of THE LAST PICTURE SHOW. Mark is there too, all drinking
beers, watching Larry line up a tough shot on the eight ball.

                    LARRY
          I’ll bet you five bucks I’m gonna
          pocket this.

Surprising to no one, Larry’s competitive as all hell.

                    KEARNS
          Five bucks? Let me see it.

                    LARRY
          Well, I don’t got it on me. But
          Shorty still owes me for sweeping
          last week. Hey Shorty, you got me?

Larry calls out to the owner, SHORTY READER (50’s) a little
person. Under five feet. A great guy but he shakes his head.

                    KEARNS
          Bet’s off. There you go.

                    BILL HODGES (O.S.)
          I can spot you five bucks.

They all turn, surprised, to see Bill Hodges in the door.

                    BILL HODGES (CONT’D)
          You play like you did tonight,
          don’t see how I could lose. And you
          weren’t tired, or nothing.

                    LARRY
          Why’d I be tired against them?

                    BILL HODGES
          Saw those scrapes on your arm. You
          been putting up hay?

Larry looks at his arms, surprised at Hodges’ insight.

                    KEARNS
          We been at it all day. Put up
          twelve hundred bales. What do you
          know about that?

                    BILL HODGES
          I told Larry before. I grew up in a
          place just like this. My whole
          family are farmers.
                                                         9.


                    LARRY
          Yeah, well I thought I told you,
          you should stop wasting your time.
          Don’t know what my mom told you,
          but I’m done playing college ball.
          You need a player up there, why
          don’t you talk to Kearns. He’d have
          been a great player, ever gotten
          the chance.

                     BILL HODGES
          They say the same thing about you.
              (that slows Larry a bit)
          I don’t know what happened in
          Bloomington, son, but Indiana
          State’s a small school. Only 3000
          kids. You’d fit in there just fine.
              (beat)
          You all three should come up. Play
          some ball with the team. Take a
          look at Terre Haute.

                    MARK
          You actually gotta team there? You
          ever even been to the tournament?

Larry and the boys laughs. Hodges takes it in stride.

                    HODGES
          Not yet, but we will. It just takes
          the right players.
              (of Larry’s reluctance)
          How ‘bout I make you a deal? You
          hit that shot and I’ll walk out the
          door. Never see me again. But you
          miss, you owe me a trip to Terre
          Haute. What do you think? How’s
          that sound?

                    LARRY
          I never see you again?
              (off Hodges nod)
          All right. I’ll take that bet.

Larry picks up the cue and lines up his shot.

                    LARRY (CONT’D)
          Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

CRACK! Hodges watches crestfallen as Larry pockets the ball.

                    LARRY (CONT’D)
          Least you still got the five bucks.
                                                        10.


Larry and his friends head off laughing when --

                    BILL HODGES
          Hold on Larry, wait up.

Hodges catches him at the door.

                    BILL HODGES (CONT’D)
          I know why you’re scared. I heard
          what happened with your dad, but --

                    LARRY
              (stops him immediately)
          That got nothing to do with it.
          That’s just something that
          happened.

                    BILL HODGES
          All right. My apologies. Let me
          just say one thing... ISU. Indiana.
          I don’t care. But don’t let that
          hurt swallow the rest of your life.
          Don’t be the best player that no
          one ever heard of.

With that Hodges goes, leaving Larry, deep in thought as we --

                                            FLASHBACK TO:


INT. SPRING VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 1975)

THREE YEARS AGO. A packed house. Edge of their seats as --

YOUNG LARRY, a junior for Spring Valley, shoots free throws.
Game on the line. Team down by one. No time on the clock.

Larry drains both. Ice in his 16-year-old veins. The CROWD
goes through the roof. No one more excited than --

Larry’s father, Joe Bird, clapping wildly in the stands and --


INT. BIRD FAMILY HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK - 1975)

Joe Bird now sits beside his son in the kitchen of their very
humble house getting the hard sell from INDIANA UNIVERSITY
HEAD COACH -- BOBBY KNIGHT (30. Famously hard-ass. The
spitting image of a young Charles Grodin.)

                    BOBBY KNIGHT
          When I recruit a player, Larry, for
          the University of Indiana, I expect
          them to earn it.
                    (MORE)
                                                        11.

                     BOBBY KNIGHT (CONT'D)
          To work hard, go to class, to
          graduate, and win, and from what I
          can tell, you got a hell of a
          drive. We’d love for you to come be
          a Hoosier.

Larry shakes Bob’s hand, sealing it as his father looks on.


EXT. KIMBALL PIANO FACTORY - DAY (FLASHBACK - 1975)

At grand piano factory, the biggest employer in French Lick --

                    JOE BIRD (PRELAP)
          -- these experts in Europe, they
          can tell where a piano comes from
          just from the look of the lacquer.


INT. KIMBALL PIANO FACTORY - DAY (FLASHBACK - 1975)

Joe Bird’s in the spray both of a sprawling organ factory,
lacquering the cabinet of a grand piano. Fine, custom work.
Larry looks on with pride and --

                    JOE BIRD (PRELAP)
          One over there could be at Carnegie
          Hall. One piano I painted was gonna
          be on TV. Supposed to at least...

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Larry follows his father through the main floor of the
factory, filled with gleaming black pianos. They look like
coffins.

                    JOE BIRD (CONT’D)
          Point I’m making I guess, when you
          work on something special -- you
          see it all the way through. From
          the very beginning when it’s just
          an idea, all the way to the end,
          and the finishing touches. That’s
          something you can be proud of.
          That’s what you’re going to do.

Larry takes this to heart. And when Joe, a hard living man

shoulder, in what passes for affection, Larry is whole and --

EXT. BIRD FAMILY HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK 1975)

A few months later, Larry’s leaving for college. He hugs his
mom, siblings, and Granny before saying goodbye to his dad.

                    JOE BIRD
          It’s a first rate program up there.
          It’s sure going to be something.
          Call us when you’re settled.

Joe Bird is not going. They do not have a car. Instead,
Larry’s uncle, AMOS KEARNS, is going to give him a lift.
Larry tosses his ONE BAG in the back and gets in the car.

                    MARK
          Give ‘em hell.

Then he’s gone, looking back at his Father, waving proudly
behind as we DISSOLVE BACK TO:


EXT. FRENCH LICK GRAVEYARD - DAY (1976)

Where 19-year-old Larry stands in a cemetery, Caterpillar hat
in hand, looking over a simple grave. His father’s. JOE BIRD.

You’ll never catch Larry crying, but off his obvious pain --


INT. FLICK’S DINNER, FRENCH LICK - DAY

We finally meet Larry’s mother, GEORGIA BIRD, working a
waitressing shift at a French Lick greasy spoon.

A hard-working, 45-year-old mother of six with zero self pity
and even less patience for fools, she yells at a COOK with
her arms full of dishes.

                    GEORGIA
          Where the heck is that burger? I
          got two tickets waiting already.

                    COOK
          It’s coming. Hold on, unless you
          want it still bleeding.

                    GEORGIA
          I don’t care if it’s moo-ing. What
          I don’t want to hear’s any moaning
          and groaning when I’m out here
          busting my hump and you’re screwing
          up tips. Only works, we’re a team.
                                                         13.


Oh, and she’s demanding as well. It runs in the family.
Georgia heads off steaming when ANOTHER WAITRESS approaches.

                    ANOTHER WAITRESS
          Table three just sat down. Think
          you might wanna take it.

Georgia’s surprised to find Larry, at a table alone and --

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Georgia sits in the booth with her son. The silence is icy.

                    GEORGIA
          Heard you were working for the
          Street Department.

                    LARRY
          Yeah. A few months. Guys are great.
          It’s not bad.

                    GEORGIA
          And you’re staying with Granny?
              (Larry nods)
          Know she likes having you there.
          When you were boys, always did.

A long silence again. Finally, Larry speaks up --

                    LARRY
          You know, I talked to Bill Hodges.

                    GEORGIA
          Ok. Is that right?

                    LARRY
          You didn’t tell him where I was?

                    GEORGIA
          I slammed the door in his face.
          That’s what you said to do right?

It is and she’s done it, but her displeasure is clear.

                    LARRY
          I know you’re mad that I left but --

                    GEORGIA
          I don’t care. It’s your choice. You
          want to be a bum, fine.

Larry takes a long beat --
                                                          14.


                    LARRY
          If I stayed at Indiana, think
          things with dad’ve been different?

That changes the mood. Georgia’s armor comes down.

                     GEORGIA
          Your dad quit on us, Larry. That’s
          not your fault. It’s his. It’s ok
          to be mad.

                    LARRY
          I’m not mad. I’m just asking. You
          think if I’d stayed in...?

                     GEORGIA
          Nothing at all would be different.
          Some people can’t stand things, I
          guess.
              (beat)
          Honey, I miss him too, but if you
          stay here and do nothing, you’re
          gonna end up just like him. It’s
          time to move on with your life.

Off Larry, considering, cut right to the bone and --


EXT. INDIANA STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY

It’s a beautiful day at Indiana State University when Mark’s
car arrives at the sleepy campus in Terre Haute, Indiana.

Larry, sitting shotgun, takes in the sights out his windows.
A far cry from the sprawling, crowded quads in Bloomington.

Larry’s not immediately repulsed and --


INT. INDIANA STATE UNIVERSITY GYM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Larry, Mark, and Kevin Kearns, all in sneakers and jeans,
enter the gym where a (very skeptical) ISU TEAM practices.
Bill Hodges bounds over, excited to greet them.

                    BILL HODGES
          Glad you changed your mind. Wanna
          run for a bit?

                    LARRY
          That’s why drove up.
                                                           15.


                    BILL HODGES
          All right. Go get changed. We got
          some shorts and shoes in the locker
          room, you guys are welcome to use.

                    LARRY
          We’ll play in these. It’s ok.
          That’s how we do it at home.

Larry picks up a ball and steps onto the court, still wearing
his jeans. The ISU PLAYERS laugh. Must be some kind of joke --

                    DISMISSIVE PLAYER
          This kid’s got some fucking balls.

                    LARRY
          I got bigger than you.

And just to go prove his point, Larry puts up a 25 footer
that hits nothing by net. Off the ISU TEAM’S eye-roll ---

WE MONTAGE THROUGH A SCRIMMAGE

Where Larry, Mark, and Kevin humiliate the ISU STARTING FIVE.

They pick them apart with back-doors. Defend like a swarm.
Hit bombs from so deep the starters throw up their hands and -

Once Larry’s last 20-footer drops in their faces, bringing
the game to an end, the dismissive player shakes his hand.

                    DISMISSIVE PLAYER
          Hate to see how you play in shorts.

                    LARRY
          Just get a better look at my balls.

Larry and the player both laugh as Hodges approaches.

                     BILL HODGES
          I told you we could use you.
              (beat)
          It’s not Bloomington, Larry. We got
          a small town feel here. You can
          just come and play ball. Maybe do
          something special. What do you say?
          Wanna get back in the game?

Off Larry, who for the first time, is considering and --
                                                        16.


EXT. FLICK’S DINNER, FRENCH LICK - NIGHT

It’s dark at the dinner where Georgia Bird’s hauling trash to
the dumpster at the end of a shift when she sees Larry,
standing by her car in the lot. A long beat.

                    LARRY
          Want a hand?

She tosses the bag in the dumpster herself. Tough as nails.

                    GEORGIA
          Heard you went up to Terre Haute.
          Mark said you guys played. Are
          those boys any good?

                    LARRY
          Not right now, they ain’t, no --
              (Larry takes a long beat)
          But when I get there they will be.

Hold on Georgia a beat, realizing what he’s saying.

                    GEORGIA
          You gonna graduate this time?

                    LARRY
          I’ll do better than that. I’m gonna
          bring home a championship.

That’s a pretty tall order. Off Larry’s extreme confidence --

                                                  CUT TO:


EXT. INDIANA STATE UNIVERSITY - AFTERNOON

A TITLE CARD READS:   TWO YEARS LATER

-- and a whole lot has changed. The formerly, sleepy little
campus is buzzing as STUDENTS hurry across the quad toward --

THE HULMAN CENTER GYM where lines snake out the door for the
hottest ticket in town.

                    ANOUNCER #1 (PRELAP)
          Before Larry Bird arrived, the
          Indiana State Sycamores had never
          so much as even reached the NCAA
          tournament but now...
                                                           17.


INT. HULMAN CENTER - GYM - AFTERNOON

A packed crowd fills the seats watching Larry (21) and the
undefeated ISU SYCAMORES grinding through a tough game
against ILLINOIS STATE.

                    ANOUNCER #1
          In his senior year, Larry Bird’s
          team is number one in the nation.
          With an undefeated record of 18-0,
          Bird leads college basketball in
          nearly every statistical category,
          it’s hard to see what stands behind
          him and an NCAA Championship.

And Larry proves it on the court where with ONE MINUTE LEFT
IN THE FOURTH, ISU’s down 67-68, Larry’s got the ball deep in
the corner. DEFENDER painted all over him until --

In a savage move he’s made famous, Larry fakes a pass over
the defender’s head, turning the poor kid around like a dog
playing fetch only --

Larry’s still got the ball and before the defender even knows
it, Larry drains a deep jumper, giving his team the lead.

                    ANOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
          And Bird does it again! Keeping
          their undefeated season alive.

The CROWD ROARS. Many, ATTRACTIVE YOUNG CO-EDS wearing “I’M A
BIRD WATCHER” T-shirt. Larry’s face on their chest.

The game should be all over only on the ensuing possession,
LEROY (one of Larry’s teammates) reaches over the line, bone-
headedly fouling the INBOUNDER.

                    ANOUNCER #1
          Oh! Big mistake. That’s put
          Illinois on the line, with a chance
          to take the lead.

Larry’s look could kill. Leroy can’t even look at him. And
when the ISU INBOUNDER sinks both free-throws, giving his
team the lead with just two seconds left --

Leroy knows he’s dead-meat. Bill Hodges calls time-out and
Larry heads to the bench, steaming with anger.

The Sycamores huddle. Coach draws up a play. Larry’s not
listening. Eyes burning through Leroy when --

The REF blows the whistle and the team takes the court. Larry
whispers to his inbounder, CARL NICKS.
                                                           18.


                    LARRY
          Just get me the damn ball.

Nicks knows better than to argue. With two seconds left, he
takes the ball out of bounds. Everyone knows where it’s
going.

At the top of the key, Larry’s draped with defenders, but
Nicks throws him the ball -- the CLOCK drops to ONE as --

Larry spins back, letting loose a long fadeaway over the
outstretched fingers of the entire ILLINOIS STATE TEAM that --

BANG! Falls straight through the net as time runs off the
clock. Everyone jumps on Larry, who still stares down Leroy.

A REPORTER APPROACHES.

                    REPORTER
          Amazing shot at the end. Larry,
          how’d you pull this one off?

                    LARRY
          You watched the game. You just saw.
          Why don’t you write it yourself?

The Reporter is dumbfounded as Larry storms off into the
tunnel, with other things on his mind and --


INT. SYCAMORES LOCKER ROOM, HULMAN CENTER - THAT MOMENT

Barreling into the locker room, Larry beelines for Leroy.

                    LARRY
          Are you happy now, Leroy?

                    LEROY
          Get the fuck out of my face.

It quickly could come to blows. Carl jumps in to defuse.

                    CARL
          C’mon, Larry. We won. It was just a
          mistake.

                    LARRY
          We can’t make no mistakes. We wanna
          finish this run, we gotta fucking
          be perfect. You don’t want to be
          out here, you can get the hell out.

Leroy is furious. Mumbles under breath --
                                                        19.


                    LARRY (CONT’D)
          You got something to say?

                    LEROY
          If I did, what’s the point? Not
          like you let any of us talk, you
          fucking Goober.

Leroy heads off to the showers, leaving Larry burning up.

                    CARL
          Just cut him some slack. I know you
          want to win, but it’s hard on the
          guys. You get all the attention.
          Makes some fellas feel jealous.

                    LARRY
          Hell, I’m the one should be
          jealous.

                    CARL
          Oh yeah. Really? Why’s that?

                    LARRY
          ‘Cause I never got to play beside a
          player like Larry Bird.

Off Carl’s laugh, knowing Larry is serious. But he’s earned
those kind of balls because --


INT. GYM, HOLMEN CENTER - HOURS LATER

When the fans are long gone and the other players have left,
a JANITOR sweeps the dark, empty stands watching --

Larry, shooting free throws in the dark. Again and again.

                    JANITOR
          Larry! Game’s over. Why you still
          out here shooting 500 free throws?

                    LARRY
          ‘Cause there’s somebody somewhere
          shooting five hundred and one.

                    JANITOR
          He don’t have a life either?

That gets a laugh out of Larry, who puts up one more and --

                    DINAH (PRELAP)
          Excuse me. Aren’t you Larry Bird?
                                                        20.


INT. THE BALLYHO - NIGHT

Larry is drinking a beer at his local college bar (his
favorite place outside of the gym) when a funny, beautiful,
down to earth co-ed approaches. DINAH.

                    DINAH
          I don’t have one of those t-shirts
          but would you sign my magazine?

She places a SPORTS ILLUSTRATED on the bar. A pretty amazing
artifact. THE 1977 COLLEGE BASKETBALL PREVIEW. ON THE COVER:

Larry’s in his powder blue uniform. TWO COMELY CHEERLEADERS
beside him, fingers raised to their lips. The headline reads:

         “COLLEGE BASKETBALL’S SECRET WEAPON”

Larry can hardly even look at it. It’s goofy as hell.

                    LARRY
          You’re not a reporter are you? I
          swear to god, I didn’t lay a hand
          on those girls.

                    DINAH
          You better not, cause I’d kill you.

Then Dinah kisses Larry and we understand, they’re a couple.

                    DINAH (CONT’D)
          You wanna get out of here, or you
          still putting in work?

She means his beer. Larry downs the rest of it and --


INT. LARRY’S DORM ROOM - LATER

Larry lies with Dinah in bed. Both breathless and flushed.
They’re not quite smoking cigarettes but you get the point.
Larry looks at his feet, hanging over the foot of the bed.

                    LARRY
          They gotta make these beds bigger.

                    DINAH
          Could say the same about you.

Larry elbows her, laughs. She rolls into his arm.
                                                        21.


                    DINAH (CONT’D)
          Can I ask you a question? The
          Sports Illustrated cover, why
          didn’t you give them an interview?

                    LARRY
          Just don’t like those reporters.
          They don’t care about basketball.
          They just wanna know personal
          stuff. Where you’re from? What’s
          your brother’s name? What are you
          doing tomorrow?

Dinah laughs. Assuming Larry is kidding. He’s not.

                    LARRY (CONT’D)
          You gotta be careful ‘cause a lot
          of them want to find out what goes
          on inside you. The private you.
          They don’t even want to talk about
          basketball. They’re interested in
          knowing who your girlfriend is or
          why you worked on a garbage truck.

                    DINAH
          And what’s so bad about that?

                    LARRY
          It’s just nobody’s business.

                    DINAH
          Not even mine?

Larry takes a beat, thinking and --

                    LARRY
          You know what I love about playing?
          Sometimes, you get in a game and
          just everything’s working. You can
          see all the angles. You can make
          any shot and when you get in that
          zone -- like we’ve been playing on
          season -- everything else fades
          away. There’s no past. There’s no
          problems. It’s just like nothing
          else matters. Beautifulest thing in
          the world. Not to think about
          nothing. That’s what I’m trying to
          do. Finish something. Perfect.

Dinah is wise and knows he’s talking about much more.
                                                        22.


                    DINAH
          Well, you’re 33-0. Who do you
          think’s going to stop you?

                    LARRY
          He’s trying. I know.

Larry reaches over to his desk and produces another SPORTS
ILLUSTRATED ISSUE. On the cover of this one: MAGIC JOHNSON.
Floating to the rim in a top hat and tails.

                    DINAH
          Top hat? Are you kidding? Magic
          Johnson can’t touch you. But... I
          bet he did give an interview.

Larry manages a laugh, his eyes not leaving Magic as we hear:

                    ANNOUNCER (PRELAP)
          Welcome back to Salt Lake where the
          Quakers need a new spell if want to
          stop Magic.


EXT. SALT LAKE CITY - NIGHT (ESTABLISHING)

Outside the SPECIAL EVENTS CENTER in Downtown SALT LAKE CITY,
a huge MARQUEE READS:

              1979 NCAA FINAL FOUR - SEMIFINAL
       MICHIGAN STATE VS. UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA.


INT. SPECIAL EVENTS CENTER, SALT LAKE CITY - NIGHT

From high in the stands, Larry and the ISU TEAM (many in
cowboy hats and boots) watch Michigan State put a historic
hurting on the poor UPENN team.

                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          And Magic hits another and that’s
          four in a row and the Spartan’s
          just look unstoppable / And Kelser
          connects again and it’s 30-6 and we
          may just be seeing the best team in
          Basketball.

From Larry’s eagle-eyed P.O.V, we see Magic tear the UPENN
team apart. 50-17 at the half and Magic’s putting on a show.

He runs a two-on-one break, dishing no-look to a cutting
TERRY DONNELY. Hits a sky-hook in the lane in a move he’ll

doubters who think he can’t shoot as --
                                                         23.


Larry watches it all with the eyes of a sniper trying to
crosshair his prey, realizing he might be outmatched until --

                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          And the ball game is over and it’s
          not even close. 101-67 and they’ll
          head to the finals for the first
          time in Michigan State History!

The MSU team celebrates. MSU fans in the stands cheering --

                    MSU FANS
          WE WANT BIRD! WE WANT BIRD!

                    CARL
          You’re gonna get him all right!

But Larry listens, unmoving, still laser focused on Magic.

                    CARL (CONT’D)
          Come on, Birdie. Let’s beat it.
          Let’s catch a movie or something.
          We’ll see these suckers on Monday.

Off Larry, considering, as the chants echo out --

                    MSU FANS
          WE WANT BIRD! WE WANT BIRD!


INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

JOHN HURT is on screen, eating dinner on the Nostromo.

                    JOHN HURT (ON MOVIE SCREEN)
          The first thing I’m gonna do when I
          get back is eat some decent food.

The whole ISU team watches ALIEN in the dark. Cowboy boots
propped up on the seats. Larry watches, distracted as --

                    YAPHET KOTTO (ON MOVIE SCREEN)
          Listen, I’d rather be eating
          something else but, right now I’ll
          stick to food.

THEATERS GOERS in front of him CACKLE loudly at the screen.

                    THEATER GO-ER (O.C.)
          Oh-no! Watch out here it comes.

                    LARRY
              (under his breath)
          Why don’t you shut up down there?
                                                        24.


And then the whole audience SCREAMS! when the creature bursts
out of John Hurt’s chest and scatters away on the table.

                    THEATER GO-ER #2 (O.C.)
          Look at him go. Magic, that looked
          like you on the break!

The theater go-er’s crack up as Larry dawns with realization
at who’s seated with him in the dark in this theater and --

                    CARL (PRELAP)
          I’ll say, that chick was bad-ass.


INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - LATER

The movie is over. Larry and his cowboy attired teammates
file into the lobby, still scared out of their gourds when --

The doors swing open behind them and the entire MSU
basketball team exits. Magic brings up the rear.

A long silence. The two teams facing off, until --

                    MSU PLAYER
          Howdy pardners. Giddy-up.

The MSU players crack-up at the ISU team standing there in
their ten gallon hats.

                    ISU PLAYER
          Go ahead. Laugh all you want. We’ll
          be riding your ass tomorrow.

                    MSU PLAYER
          Oh yeah, is that what you think?

                    ISU PLAYER
          Man, you better believe it. We
          haven’t lost all damn year.

                    MSU PLAYER
          Gonna make it sad when you do.

As they go on talking shit -- Magic sidles up next to Bird.

                    MAGIC
          Hey Larry. Good to see ya. What’d
          ya think of the movie?

Magic, all smiles, happy to see an old friend only --

                    LARRY
          Don’t fucking talk to me, man.
                                                           25.


Larry moves off, pulling his teammates out with him, leaving
Magic just stunned. Larry already has his game face on as --

                    BRYANT GUMBLE (V.O.)
          Welcome Ladies and Gentleman to the
          NCAA Championship. It’s Indiana
          State against Michigan State. I’m
          Bryant Gumble and the fans here are
          going bananas.


EXT. SPECIAL EVENTS CENTER, SALT LAKE CITY - NIGHT

Crowds pour inside for the most anticipated final in College
Basketball History.

TITLE CARD READS:   NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP GAME
              INDIANA STATE VS. MICHIGAN STATE
                       MARCH 25, 1979

                     BRYANT GUMBLE (V.O.)
          It’s the Bird against Magic. All
          the superlatives have been used and
          believe me, they have been
          warranted.


INT. TRAINING ROOM, SPECIAL EVENTS CENTER - NIGHT

Larry, more stone faced than ever, sits on the training table
in his uniform getting a bad left thumb taped up.

                    TRAINER
          How’s that feel tonight, Larry?

                    LARRY
          I don’t care. Yeah, that’s fine. I
          just wanna get out there.

Larry’s focus is frightening. A fighter waiting for the bell
as the roar of crowd crescendos through the walls and --


INT. COURT - SPECIAL EVENTS CENTER - NIGHT

The crowd’s just going nuts when the teams take the court.

Larry and Magic shake hands. There is no smiling now. It’s
just war. They both position off the tip and --

Here we go. The Ref tosses the ball and Michigan gets it
first, feeding to Magic at the line.
                                                           26.


He makes a quick move to the basket, blowing by his defender,
but trips on the way and the Ref blows him for traveling.

Larry helps Magic up, shoving him briskly away, running off
down the court. Magic knows now, that’s how it will be and --

MUSIC CUE KICKS IN AS WE MONTAGE THROUGH THE GAME

Larry’s double-teamed on the block, dishing it off to his
POINT GUARD at the key who neatly buries a jumper and --

Magic takes a rebound coast to coast, gliding in for a lay-
up, exploding in a high-five as the ref calls a foul and --

Larry cuts along the baseline, catching a pass in the corner,
draining at 20-foot in two defenders’ faces and --

Magic answers right back with a hook of his own which has
Georgia Bird, screaming mad in stands and --

Larry hopes to answer right back but Heaton (his center)
misses a wide open jumper and --

Leroy (his point guard) dribbles the ball off his foot and --

We get the sense that Larry knows, no matter how much he
wants it, it’s going to be a long haul because --

The MSU team is just way too athletic. With Magic pushing the
break, they hit shot after shot and --

On defense, Larry is swarmed at all times by two and three
spartan defenders, forced to give up the ball, leaving --

Larry shaking his head as the clock ticks out at half-time
with the Spartan’s leading 37-28 at the break and --


INT. ISU LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Larry paces the room as Coach address the exhausted team.

                    COACH HODGES
          You gotta dig in. I know they’re
          fast, but you gotta get back. Don’t
          let them run on the break. We
          haven’t lost the whole season. You
          wanna fucking start now?

Larry’s studying the faces of his rattled teammates, knowing
if they’re going to come back, it will be on his back so --
                                                         27.


INT. COURT - SPECIAL EVENTS CENTER - NIGHT

-- when the second half starts, Larry is on the offensive --

He forces up a tough shot over three MSU defenders, but it
catches the iron and --

When he posts up down low with three defenders all over him,
his teammates throw it away, leaving Larry just fuming and --

When Larry shoots free throws at the line, trying to will his
team back, the greatest shooter in NCAA history misses and --

Larry hangs his head, hope starting to wain as --

Magic and Kesler continue to tear the defense apart with a
half-court alley-oop that’s rips out Bird’s heart.

Even Terry Donnelly is knocking down jumpers and before Larry
can blink the scoreboard tells us his team’s down 16 and --

He looks to the stands where Dinah and his mom feel his pain,
knowing what this all means, willing him to continue so --

Larry digs in a last time, knowing this is his chance. On the
next defensive possession, he snags a tough rebound, taking a
foul from Greg Kesler that sends the MSU star to the bench --

                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          That’s four fouls on Kesler and
          he’ll have to sit down. There may
          be life in this yet.

And Larry makes sure to squeeze it, hitting Nicks for a lay-
up with a behind the back dagger and --

A few seconds later, Larry hits a tough turn around that cuts
the lead to just nine and on the ensuing possession --

Nicks steals a pass! Feeds it Bird on the block who hits
another turn around J narrowing the lead to just six and --

MSU COACH HEATHCOAT’s livid and Georgia Bird and the ISU FANS
all explode, tasting a little new life but --

THAT’S AS CLOSE AS THEY’LL GET. A few seconds later --

Kelser checks back in the game and on the very next play, he
hits Magic back door, soaring right down the lane for a one-
handed slam that posterizes three ISU Defenders as --

Larry watches, just helpless as the ball drops through nylon,
taking the last of his hope right out the door with it.
                                                           28.


Magic walks to the line, eyeing Larry as he goes, saying --
this game is over and --

Larry’s aware that it is as Magic sinks his foul shot and
saunters back on D, flashing that smile as --

Larry’s shoulders drop, knowing there’s no coming back and --

A FEW MINUTES LATER

It’s over. Magic heaves a full court pass to a wide-open
Kelser who windmills it in as the final horn blows and --

Just like that, the dream’s gone. Jubilation for the
Spartans. Agony for Larry and the Sycamores.

For a moment, as the confetti falls and the fans storm the
court and the press all descend --

Magic and Larry pass each other in the crowd but this time
neither star stops or looks the other man the eye --

They just lightly brush by as Bird exits the court with his
heart in his throat, only this time -- WE DO NOT GO WITH HIM.

We stay focused on Magic, swarmed by reporters. With his
victorious arm draped around a YOUNG BRYANT GUBMLE.

                    YOUNG BRYANT GUMBLE
          Magic, not only were you a leader
          on offense, but I thought you did a
          great job on Larry Bird, in the
          zone, denying him the ball --

                    MAGIC
          Yes - uh - coach uh - gave us a
          good game plan to go against Larry
          Bird and all we had to do was go
          out and do it. That’s what we done.

                    YOUNG BRYANT GUMBLE
          Well congratulations. Super ball
          game.

                       MAGIC
          Thank you!

Magic heads off to celebrate, catching a last look at --

Larry, in grief on the bench, crying into a towel with a new
mission in life. Defeat the man who just killed his dreams.
                                                          29.


But that needs to wait because this time belongs to Magic. As
he’s lifted up onto his teammates’ shoulders and cuts down
the nets, we’re aware in this moment --

The world’s his for the taking. We’re along for the ride as --

INT. COOKIE’S DORM ROOM, MICHIGAN STATE - NIGHT

EARVIN “MAGIC” JOHNSON (19) lays on a dorm room floor with
his college sweetheart, EARLEATHA “COOKIE” Kelly (19).

                    MAGIC
          Whatchu mean? We’ll be fine. You
          don’t need be worried.

Magic tries to kiss his way out of it. Cookie’s unswayed.
Ambitious and grounded, she’s head-over-heels about Earvin.

                    COOKIE
          I don’t need to be worried? You,
          out in Hollywood, meeting groupies
          and movie stars...

                    MAGIC
          You think that’s what I want?

She cuts him a look.

                    COOKIE
          Maybe not Earvin, but Magic.

                    MAGIC
          You said Magic? Who’s that?

They laugh. Some more kisses. But she is clearly concerned.

                    COOKIE
          It’s a lot. I’m just worried. They
          put so much on your shoulders to
          come save this whole league and --

                    MAGIC
          Baby, I’ve been there before. When
          I was in high school and there was
          a fight, the principal would say
          “Magic! Come and talk to these
          kids.” This won’t be any different.

          This isn’t a fight in the school
          cafeteria. These are grown men
          you’ll be working with.

                    MAGIC
          You so worried, then come? Gonna
          have my own place. Go to the beach
          everyday. You look nice on a towel.

                     COOKIE
          Oh yeah, and what about school? I
          got another year till I’m done. I’m
          not living off you.
              (beat)
          Earvin, I just want to know. Are we
          together or not?

                    MAGIC
          Of course we are... sort of.

Cookie is hurt, only Magic is laughing.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          I’m just playing. Come on. Baby,

          nothing to worry about.

Earvin says goodbye to Cookie and his family at their modest
home. Very tight quarters for TEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

A taxi waits outside at Magic gives hugs and jokes to them
all, finally arriving at his father, EARVIN SR. An incredibly
hard working man wearing Dickies.

                    EARVIN SR.
          Wish I could take you myself. Got
          another shift in an hour.

                    MAGIC
          That’s all right, dad. The Laker’s

They hug. Very close. Very proud.

Magic nods, arriving lastly at his mother, CHRISTINE JOHNSON.
She hands him a book. THE BIBLE.

                    CHRISTINE JOHNSON
          You’re a unifier, June Bug. Be that
          for your team. And you be good to
          that girl. (Cookie.)

                    BROTHER
          You go slay ‘em, Magic!

                    CHRISTINE JOHNSON
              (hates this name)
          I did not name you that. Remember
          who you are, Earvin. Do not lose
          yourself there.

                    MAGIC
          Me, ma? Never.

And Magic flashes his smile and then gets in the car as his
family all wave, leaving the old, cold world behind for --


EXT. LOS ANGELES - DAY

A postcard Los Angeles sky. Palm Trees. Bentleys. The
California Dream. It’s viewed out the windows of --


I/E. LIMOUSINE - DAY

A WHITE STRETCH LIMO cruising through Beverly Hills with
Magic in back. Like he’s driving through heaven.

                    FEMALE DRIVER (O.C.)
          Pretty here, isn’t it?

                    MAGIC
          Yeah. It’s pretty all right.

The driver he’s smiling at is -- A PLAYBOY BUNNY, wearing a
chauffeur’s cap on her head and hardly anything else.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          I thought most limo drivers were
          fat white cats in suits?

                    FEMALE DRIVER
          Dr. Buss made a request. Said stars
          like you deserved only the best.
                                                           35.


                    MAGIC
          Dr. Buss said that, huh?

Magic considers, appreciative when --

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          Slow down. Pull over a minute.

-- out the window he spots TREES BENDING WITH ORANGES. The
Driver does as instructed and --


EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - STREET

Magic steps from the Limo and walks up to a lawn outside a
shimmering mansion and plucks an ORANGE from a tree. He
hardly believes this is real and --


EXT. THE LOS ANGELES FORUM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The limo arrives at the VIP ENTRANCE to the L.A. Forum. “The
finest arena since the Roman Colosseum.” Magic admires it.

                    FEMALE DRIVER
          You need a ride home... or maybe
          just a friend for a drink, why
          don’t you give me call.

She hands him her number. It just gets better and better.


INT. THE FORUM - DAY

Magic enters his new home court, shaking hands and chatting
up every STAFFER in the joint.

                    MAGIC
          Nice to meet ya. Magic Johnson.
          Nice to meet ya! Great hat.

They are utterly perplexed by this young Rookie’s sparkle
because when Magic reaches --


INT. LOCKER ROOM, FORUM - DAY

He finds a funeral atmosphere. THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS of 1979
are not a team of charisma. At least, they aren’t yet.

Bright eyed and bushy tailed, Magic goes around the room
introducing himself to his grown-ass new teammates.

TO MICHAEL COOPER, the high flying, hard partying forward --
                                                           36.


                    MAGIC
          Hey Coop. Nice to meet ya. Can’t
          wait to hit you with those lobs. We
          could call it a COOP-A-LOOP!

TO JAMAL WILKES, the rangy spot-up, deep threat.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          Hey Wilkes, you the man. Keep your
          hands up. Be ready. I’m gonna find
          you those threes.

TO VETERAN POINT GUARD NORM NIXON, who’s not happy at all.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          Hey Norm! Great to me you. Proud to
          be on the same team as the silkiest
          handle in the league!

Nixon hates him immediately. In fact, no one knows what to
make of this kid. They wait eagerly to see what happens when -

Magic finally approaches the captain, KAREEM ABDUL JABAR,
who’s reading the NEW YORK TIMES by his locker.

                     MAGIC (CONT’D)
          Hey Cap, nice to meet you. It’s an
          honor to be here and be part of
          your team.

Magic sticks out his hand. Kareem looks at it a beat and
walks straight out of the room, leaving Magic just hanging.

                    MICHAEL COOPER
          Welcome the NBA “Magic.” Hope you
          ready to save the league!

Off Magic, crestfallen as his new teammates laugh and --


EXT. MAGIC’S CULVER CITY APARTMENT - EVENING

A bag of groceries under his arm, Magic heads into his new
L.A. pad. A sunbaked apartment complex built around a pool.
On MELROSE PLACE, this set-up’s inviting. In reality, kinda
sad. Magic passes through toward door and --


INT. MAGIC’S CULVER CITY APARTMENT - EVENING

He keys into his pre-furnished apartment, setting his
groceries in the kitchen, and takes in the space. Empty.
Impersonal. For a twenty-year-old kid, it feels a long way
from home. Off the sound of a RINGING PHONE --
                                                           37.


                    MAGIC (PRELAP)
          ...and did Mom make the chicken?


INT. MAGIC’S CULVER CITY APARTMENT - A FEW HOURS LATER

(The original) PERRY MASON on tv. Magic on the phone with his
family back home. Microwave dinner on his lap. Pretty bleak.

                    PEARL (FILTERED)
          No. Dad made some ribs. They were
          overcooked, but still good. How’s
          it going out there?

                    MAGIC
          Oh, you know, it’s great. Really
          getting along. The team is real
          nice. And L.A. is just great.

Magic lies through his teeth as we INTERCUT WITH:


INT. MAGIC’S CHILDHOOD HOME, EAST LANGSING - NIGHT

Magic’s sister, PEARL, on the phone in their very missed
little home. Loving, family chaos around her.

                    MAGIC
          How’s Cookie doing? You see her?

                    PEARL
          She checks in now and then. Busy
          working at school. Got a job at
          Alliance in the clothing
          department.

                    MAGIC
          Yeah, she told me. That’s great.
          And how’s mom and dad doing --

                    PEARL
          They’re good. You know -- Earvin.
          Sorry. I gotta run. Dad’s just
          about to head out and I gotta make
          up his lunch. Call you later, ok.

                    MAGIC
          Yeah, call me later. I’m --

But she’s hung up the phone as we end on: Magic, with the
vacant receiver. In the empty apartment. Microwave tray on
his lap. He pushes it away, feeling sorry for himself when --

THE PHONE RINGS again. Magic answers immediately.
                                                        38.


                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          Yeah, you better call back. Hanging
          up on you brother like -- oh!
              (he sits up on the sofa)
          No, I’m sorry. Dr. Buss? I thought
          you were my sister. We were just on
          the... do I like Donuts? You bet...
          Yeah, I think I can find it. Let me
          just grab a pen.

Magic fumbles for a pen, scribbling down an address and --


INT. LOS ANGELES DONUT SHOP - MORNING

A few days later, Magic sits in a greasy Donut Shop, sharing
a box of chocolate donuts with his boss, the Lakers owner --

DR. JERRY BUSS. A Burt Reynolds-handsome, 50-year-old playboy
with a porn star mustache and western denim shirt unbuttoned
mid-chest. A true American original.

                     BUSS
          ...and how are you liking the
          apartment?

                    MAGIC
          Oh, it’s terrific. Thanks a lot.

                    BUSS
          I thought it would be a good base
          to get acclimated in town. Close to
          the practice facilities and all
          but...
              (chewing over donut)
          I own all kinds of property. Places
          all over town so if there’s
          something else that you’d like,
          don’t hesitate to just ask.

                    MAGIC
          Thank you so much. It’s great.

                    BUSS
          Well, it’s the least I can do. And
          how do you like the donuts? The
          chocolate ones are my favorite.

Magic smiles at Buss. Not your typical owner.

                    BUSS (CONT’D)
          I know how it is, being in a new
          place is tough.
                    (MORE)
                                                           39.

                     BUSS (CONT’D)
          I just bought the team too, so it’s
          my first year as well. We’ll get
          through it together because I’ve
          got a plan.
              (then)
          Do you like football at all, Magic?
          Something I want you to see.


INT. DARK TUNNEL - DAY

And then Dr. Buss is leading Magic through a dark, noisy
tunnel. Like Henry Hill at the Copa.

                    BUSS
          See, what the league doesn’t get --
          they think the problem is race, but
          they’re wrong. It’s the product.
          It’s stale. I’ve got a dream for
          the Lakers. I want to put on a
          show. Basketball’s not just a game,
          it should be entertainment. The
          hottest ticket in town and Magic,
          that’s why you’re here.

Magic must squint as they emerge from the tunnel into the
blazing hot sun, blaring down above --


EXT. ROSE BOWL STADIUM - DAY

-- where Magic and Buss emerge directly onto the field of a
USC Football Game. The energy and scale are just seismic.

Buss lights a cigar, pointing Magic toward the band.

                    BUSS
          See the spectacle, Magic? With the
          band and the dancers. That’s what
          brings out a crowd.

Magic takes in the moment. The roar of the stadium. The legs
of the cheerleaders.

                    BUSS (CONT’D)
          I used to go to a classy club in
          Santa Monica called The Horn.
          Beautiful dancers. The works. And
          before they would come out, they
          would dim all the lights, get
          everyone all excited assing
          “Showtime!” And everyone would go
          nuts. That’s what I’m bringing to
          the Lakers. The best food.
                    (MORE)
                                                          40.

                    BUSS (CONT’D)
          The best seats. The prettiest women
          in town, dancing right on the
          court. This is Hollywood, Magic,
          and we have to give them a show.

                    MAGIC
          That sounds great, Dr. Buss, but
          these older guys, I don’t know --
          they don’t play like I play --

                    BUSS
          That’s exactly why I got you.
          Kareem’s a great player but he
          doesn’t have IT. He’s a
          philosophizing, black Muslim who
          even hates his own fans.

                                              FLASH CUT TO:


EXT. FORUM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Kareem in a Dashiki approached by an adoring YOUNG WHITE FAN.

                    YOUNG WHITE FAN
          Hey Kareem! You’re my favorite.
          Could I please get an autograph?

                    KAREEM
          Go fuck yourself, kid.

The kid starts to cry. Kareem never looks back.

                    BUSS (PRE-LAP)
          That’s doesn’t exactly put the
          butts in the seats.

                                                CUT BACK TO:


EXT. ROSE BOWL STADIUM - AS BEFORE

Magic, listening on the sidelines to Buss.

                    BUSS
          But you, Magic? You got IT come out
          of your ears. Don’t believe me?
          Just listen.

Because right at this moment, the crowd has discovered Magic
and Buss on the field and a chant’s begun to ring out --

                    CROWD
          Magic! Magic! Magic! Magic!
                                                          41.


                    BUSS
          Go on, wave your hand.

Magic waves to the crowd, sending them into a frenzy.

                    BUSS (CONT’D)
          This is Hollywood, Magic, and we
          need a star. You can’t run from the
          spotlight. I want you to grab it.

Magic soaks up the applause. Hard to say no to that and --


EXT. MALIBU - NIGHT

Waves crash in the moonlight as Magic’s date continues at --


I/E. DONALD STERLING’S MALIBU MANSION - NIGHT

-- where a glamorous beach party rages. Dr. Buss weaves Magic
through an audacious home full of STARLETS and CELEBRITIES --

                    BUSS
          Hello Jamie. Hey there Connie.
          Looking special tonight.

LEGGY WOMEN kiss Dr. Buss. He seems to run this whole town.
Magic is absolutely enthralled as Buss continues his sermon.

                    BUSS (CONT’D)
          All the glitz you see here, I want
          that flash on the court. When
          people think of New York, what do
          they think of? The Yankees. The
          Lakers will be that for L.A. and
          you’re gonna be our Babe Ruth. And
          all this comes with that.

He waves his hand over the party. The money. The women.
Handing Magic a glass of Champagne.

                    MAGIC
          Oh, no thanks. I don’t drink.

                    BUSS
          That’s alright. No, that’s great.
          There’s plenty of ways to get high.

Magic watches Buss down his own drink and then --
                                                          42.


INT. HOLLYWOOD NIGHTCLUB - VERY LATE AT NIGHT

Many hours later, Magic sits VIP with a very drunk Buss
watching a parade of beautiful women dance at the club.

                    BUSS
          That’s Janet White. Isn’t she
          gorgeous? I bought her that dress.

He’s not talking about the dance floor. He is flipping
through a PHOTO ALBUM he’s brought. Inside, page after page
of polaroid pics of Dr. Buss and YOUNG WOMEN.

                    BUSS (CONT’D)
          This is the premiere of Saturday
          Night Fever. That’s Kiki DuCette,
          she was one of the backup
          dancers... This is Angela Tarpetti,
          she’s a really sweet girl, I
          actually knew her back in Wyoming.
          But she didn’t look like this then.

Magic’s jaw on the floor. As creepy as this sounds, Buss is
actually sweet. A sex addict, but sweet.

                    MAGIC
          Are all owners like you? Cause Dr.
          Buss - I don’t know. All these
          ladies in here, you must have a
          jump shot I don’t know about.

                    JERRY BUSS
          No, son. My talent’s up here.
              (points to his brain)
          Got scholarships to good schools.
          Tried the straight life for a
          while, but it wasn’t for me. Went
          into the real estate business. Had
          to give Jack Kemp the Chrysler
          Building to buy the Lakers, but you
          know, Magic, it was worth it.

                    MAGIC
          Dr. Buss! You owned the Chrysler
          Building?

Buss nods, eyes dreaming. Waxing very nostalgic.

                    BUSS
          Soon as the deals were all signed,
          I got the keys to the Forum. Bought
          a bottle of Jack. Went in the
          middle of the night.
                                                           43.


INT. LOS ANGELES FORUM - (FLASHBACK)

A SINGLE SPOTLIGHT SPARKS ON in the empty arena illuminating
Dr. Buss. Giddy. Drunk. Standing center court, said bottle of
whiskey bottle in hand.

                    BUSS (V.O.)
          I stood and took it all in.
          Screamed at the top of my lungs --

                    BUSS
          I FUCKING OWN THIS PLACE MAN!

Buss’s voice echoes out. Followed by his laughter as we --

                                                RETURN TO:


INT. NIGHT CLUB - AS BEFORE

Jerry and Magic, as before in the club. Deep in his reverie.

                    BUSS
          I wanted that my whole life. And
          now I’ve fucking got it. Magic, I
          want that for you.

He puts his arm around Magic. Fatherly. Drunkenly. Earnestly.

                    BUSS (CONT’D)
          You gotta make this team yours.
          These old guys take it for granted,
          but you can’t sleep walk through
          life. Don’t ever let anybody tell
          you not to be who you are or live
          how you want. What’s all this for
          if you don’t?

Off Magic, who’s found his shaman in life as we end on:


INT. LOS ANGELES FORUM - (FLASHBACK)

This image. Jerry Buss, laying snow angel, center court.
Empty bottle in hand. Crying tears of pure joy and --


INT. SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

A few months later, Magic stands courtside in his LAKER’S
WARM-UPS as the ANNOUNCER calls out the starting line-ups.

TITLE CARD READS: OCTOBER 12, 1979
                                                        44.


                    CLIPPERS ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          ...and starting tonight in his
          first professional appearance, a
          6’9” Guard out of Michigan State,
          Earvin Johnson.

Magic takes the court, ripping off his warm-up only -- his
foot gets caught in the pant leg and he falls to the ground.

The CLIPPERS CROWD jeers. Not the start Magic hoped for and --

ONCE WE’RE INTO THE GAME

...it doesn’t get too much better. Trying too hard, Magic
forces up a bad shot. He turns over the ball attempting a too
flashy pass. He’s beat badly on defense and can’t find his
rhythm until --

COACH PAUL WESTHEAD finally pulls him out of the game and
Magic, deflated, takes a seat on the bench as WE DISSOLVE TO:

10 SECONDS LEFT IN THE GAME

...it looks like Magic and Showtime’s debut will be spoiled.

                    BRENT MUSBERGER (V.O.)
          The Clippers are leading by one
          with 10 seconds left in the game.
          Just need to run out the clock and -
          - HOLY COW! I don’t believe it.

A Clippers player, FREEMAN WILLIAMS, dribbles the ball of his

                    BRENT MUSBURGER (V.O.)
          Freeman Williams has given the
          Lakers new life!

The crowd’s apoplectic. Westhead calls a time out with THREE
SECONDS left and The Lakers gather as he draws up the play.

                    PAUL WESTHEAD
          Magic, cut to the basket. Kareem’ll
          be open at the line. We got one
          shot. Get it done.

The Lakers retake the floor. DON FORD inbounding the ball.
The REF’S WHISTLE BLOWS and Magic cuts to the basket,
clearing out his defender, leaving --

Kareem open at the foul line. Ford inbounds him the ball and
he immediately soars for a SKY HOOK that’s --
                                                        45.


                    BRENT MUSBURGER (V.O.)
          Good! Lakers win. Score it!

And the Lakers go nuts. Well, at least Magic does, rushing
Kareem, jumping into his arms like he’s just saved the world.

                    BRENT MUSBURGER (V.O.)
          And Magic Johnson is out there
          celebrating like they just won the
          NCAA championship.

Magic’s jumping up and down. Hugging Kareem’s neck. Kareem’s
extremely uncomfortable.

                    KAREEM
          What the fuck are you doing? We’ve
          got 81 more of these.

                    MAGIC
          You keeping hitting that shot, I’ll
          hug you 81 more times.

Kareem doesn’t know what to say. It’s the first game of the
season but it’s already clear, there’s Magic in the air as --

WE MONTAGE THROUGH THE 1979 LAKERS SEASON

And Showtime is on. At the first home game at the Forum, Dr.
Buss paces nervously on the baseline as --

NICHOLSON and STALLONE. BO DEREK and FRANK SINATRA. It’s the
hottest party in town and Magic’s the number one star --

Locker room. In the ice bath. On the court being interviewed:

                        LAKERS VS. SIXERS
                     THE SERIES IS TIED 2-2

And Magic’s Lakers are up in a tight game. Kareem can’t be
stopped. He’s already got 24 when --

He gets the ball at the right post, pivoting into the lane,
for a sweet finger roll that drops through the net only --

When Kareem lands, his ankle rolls badly and he nearly falls
to the ground, limping off to the sidelines.

                    BRENT MUSBERGER (V.O.)
          Kareem’s hurt! Kareem’s hurt.
          There’s no question about it.

Magic and the Lakers’ fans watch in stunned silence as Kareem
is carried into the tunnel.

                    BRENT MUSBERGER (V.O.)
          They would be in more than serious
          trouble without him. I don’t think
          they can beat this club.

Immediately after the game (which the Lakers have squeaked
out) Magic enters to the locker room to find --

Kareem in a cast, burgundy turtleneck, and crutches.

          What’s the word? You’ll be good?
          We’re gonna need you tomorrow.

                    KAREEM
          They think it’s a broken fibula
          probably. Still waiting on the x-
          rays. I can’t travel to Philly.

Off Magic, taking that news like a shot in the gut and --

                    PAUL WESTHEAD (PRELAP)
          I know now’s not the time, but I’ve
          got another piece of news.


INT. LAX TERMINAL, WAITING AREA - NIGHT

The mood is real bleak as the Lakers wait to board their
flight out to Philly. Norm Nixon looks sunk. Jamal Wilkes,
wrung out. Michael Cooper is stunned. While a few seats away -

                    PAUL WESTHEAD
          Rookie of the year voting came out.
          They’ll announce it later today.

Coach Westhead sits with Magic, having a intense one on one.

                    MAGIC
          Ok. Well who won?

                    PAUL WESTHEAD
          Larry.

                    MAGIC
              (he’s crushed)
          Was it close?

Coach hands Magic a note with the numbers.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          63-3?! That a joke?
                                                        48.


                     PAUL WESTHEAD
          Go out tomorrow, prove ‘em wrong.
          We’re going to need you, to win.
              (then)
          “If it were done when 'tis done,
          then 'twere well. It were done
          quickly.”

INT. COMMERCIAL PLANE - NIGHT

The Lakers, boarding their flight. (Teams flew commercial
back then. Starters, First Class. Bums, back in coach.)

Nixon and Wilkes in First Class, looking up when they hear --

                    SINGING VOICE (O.S.)
          People let me tell you / There’s a
          time in your life when you find out
          who you are... That’s the golden
          time of day!

They shake their heads when a SUITCASE lands on Kareem’s
front row seat. It’s Magic. So is the voice. Singing MAZE.

                    NIXON
          Buck, what the fuck are you doing?
          That’s Cap’s seat.

                    MAGIC
          Not tonight. I’m playing center.
          Have no fear motherfuckers! Magic
          Johnson is here!

A long beat of silence until Michael Cooper laughs.

                    MICHAEL COOPER
          I think we might actually win.

Magic does too. Game face already on for --

circle to take the opening tip against a seven foot center.

                    BRENT MUSBURGER (V.O.)
          Magic, playing Center in the place
          of Kareem, will come in and jump --

BAM! The ref tosses the ball. Magic leaps up to get it and --

THIS GAME IS HISTORIC AND NEVER REALLY EVEN CLOSE

Playing POINT / CENTER, Magic puts on a show for the ages.

He takes a feed in the post and dunks over three men. He
drives to his left and floats skyhook through the rim. He
challenges DAWKINS at the rim, hanging in mid-air for lay-up.

While on D, he steals an entry pass in the post and
immediately turns on the gas, dropping a nasty dime to Wilkes
for a dunk on the break.

He drives again and again, scoring time after time, with a
creative arsenal of shots that the Sixers can’t stop and --

When all’s said and done and the final horn blows, Dr. Buss
is in tears sitting courtside with a MODEL as --

Westhead and assistant Coach PAT RILEY (more on him down the
road) hug in amazement on the bench and --

Magic hugs Michael Cooper, throwing his hands to the sky.

                    BRENT MUSBURGER (V.O.)
          There it is. It’s all over. And the
          most valuable player is Magic
          Johnson. He starts at Center. Plays
          Forward and Guard and leads the
          Lakers to the World Championship.

Magic has done the impossible and --


INT. LOCKER ROOM, PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

The celebration spills into the room as the Lakers pour in.
Champagne raining down. Everyone going apeshit. Musberger’s
there with the microphone. Sweating all over Magic’s jock.
                                                           50.


                    MUSBERGER
          Let me read you these stats. 42
          points. 15 rebounds. And 7 assists.
          This is your first year and you’re
          here. How many more of these would
          you like to get under your belt?

                    MAGIC
          About twenty.

They all laugh. No one has ever been higher than Magic in
this moment. He finds Dr. Buss and the two close friends hug.

                    DR. BUSS
          You’ve earned yourself a big
          fucking reward, son.

We can only guess what this means as Cooper yells out --

                    COOPER
          Hey Buck! You got a call! It’s some
          baby named Cookie! Whatchu want me
          to say?

Magic considers a moment. But for only a moment --

                    MAGIC
          I’ll call her later, all right? I
          ain’t ready for that.

-- and he turns back to Buss, leaving Cookie (and Earvin) in
the past, as he showers his owner’s head in Champagne. Two
men about to embark on a victory lap that would make Mick
Jagger-blush. Their jubilant faces frozen on --

          God. What a phony. Just look at
          this fucking clown.

                    BARTENDER
          I don’t know, buddy. Nobody was
          stopping Magic tonight.

                    DRUNK PATRON
          Larry’ll get him. Ain’t that right?
          You’re the balls! You’re gonna beat

Larry wants no part of it. Starts paying his tab.

          What? You’re not scared of him are
          you? He’s just dumb spook.

That gets Larry’s blood boiling. Turns to the bartender.

                    LARRY
          Ever heard of cutting him off?

                    BARTENDER
          Paid his tab, same as you.

Larry rolls his eyes, heads for the door only --


EXT. CHELSEA'S BAR, BOSTON - NIGHT

When Larry gets on the street, he hears laughter behind him.
The DRUNK PATRON following him out singing --

                    DRUNK PATRON
          Bye Bye Birdie! I’m going to miss
          you so! / Bye Bye Birdie! Why’d you
          have to go?!

The drunk howls in laughter as Larry walks off.

                    DRUNK PATRON (CONT’D)
          That’s right. Walk away. I always
          heard you’re a quitter.

Larry pauses at that.

                    DRUNK PATRON (CONT’D)
          You’re gonna just let this dumb
          monkey go and beat you again? Man,
          Larry Bird isn’t shit.

The drunk put his finger in Larry’s back and that’s the last
straw and the last time he’s on his feet because --

WHAM! -- Larry cold cocks the DRUNK, knocking him down. (But,
Larry also breaks two of his fingers in the process.)

                    LARRY
          God damn it!

Hearing the commotion, the Bartender comes out the door.

                    BARTENDER
          Jesus. C’mon. Larry, better get you
          the hell outta here.

Larry looks down at the drunk holding his face on the street.

                    DRUNK PATRON
          I think you broke damn jaw.

                    LARRY
          Maybe now you’ll think about
          shutting it.

And the Bartender shepherds Larry away, who’s still fuming
mad. Shaking his hand. TWO FINGERS bent out of place and --

Red’s CAR pulls up to Larry’s simple home where a DOZENS OF
CELTICS FANS camp out across the street watching:

Millionaire superstar Larry Bird mow his own lawn in some
very, short shorts. Beer in bandaged hand. Red approaches.

                    RED AUERBACH
          You can pay someone to do that.

                    LARRY
          Not if you want it done right.
          Dinah said you checked in.

                    RED AUERBACH
          Wanted to see how you’re doing.
              (Larry shrugs, fine)
          That’s about how I thought. Need to
          take your mind off of things. You
          play tennis with that thing?

Larry considers his hand, takes a swig of his beer.

                    LARRY
          You gonna cheat like before?

                    RED AUERBACH
          I have no idea what you mean.

That pulls a laugh out of Larry and --


EXT. RED CLAY TENNIS COURT - LATER

Larry and Red play a set on a red clay court. Red (a
surprisingly solid player) has Larry on the run, shanking a
forehand into the net, conceding the set.

A little pissed off, Larry tosses his racket into the fence.

                    RED AUERBACH
          In a game, you get fined for that.

                    LARRY
          Look like I care about money?

          I’ll remember that next time we’re

                    LARRY
          You brought me here to win. We
          didn’t do it. That simple.

                    RED AUERBACH
          You led the greatest turn around in
          NBA History. Won 61 games. Didn’t
          win half that last year.

                    LARRY

          You mean without the Great White
          Hope? I don’t remember that in my
          contract.

                    RED AUERBACH

EXT. M.L. CARR’S TONY SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

M.L. opens the door of his beautiful home. COPS ON HIS PORCH.

                    BOSTON COP 1
          That wood you have there -- are you
          sure that it’s yours?

Angle on: A neatly stack cord of wood on M.L.’s porch.

                    BOSTON COP 1 (CONT’D)
          Some of the neighbors, they said it
          looked just like theirs.

                     M.L. CARR
          They said this wood looked like
          theirs? What, were they counting
          the rings?

                    BOSTON COP 1
          Sir, just answer the question. Are
          you sure that’s your wood?

                    M.L. CARR
          You sure you want to ask me again?

The Cops are pretty sure that they don’t as we --

                                              SMASH BACK TO:


INT. LOCKER ROOM, BOSTON GARDEN - AS BEFORE

Larry, listening intently as M.L. wraps his story up.

                    ML CARR
          Who goes around stealing wood?
          That’s some white people shit.

                    ROBERT PARISH
          M.L., man. That ain’t nothing.

Larry’s attention now turns to --

SUPERIMPOSE TITLES:   ROBERT PARISH #35

The seven foot black center, nicknamed THE CHIEF after the
stoic, nearly mute Chief in ONE FLEW OVER THE COOKOO’S NEST.

                    ROBERT PARISH (CONT’D)
          First year in Boston, I got pulled
          over 10 times for suspicious
          activity.

                    LARRY
          What’s that mean -- suspicious?

                    ROBERT PARISH
          Means a black guy driving a nice
          car in white neighborhood.

                    CEDRID MAXWELL
          Maybe you drove a different car,
          you wouldn’t look so suspicious.

EXT. BOSTON HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Seven foot Robert Parish, at the wheel of WHITE ROLLS ROYCE,
pulled over on the highway. It would almost be funny, except
for the CRUISER behind him and the WHITE COP at his door.

INT. LOCKER ROOM, BOSTON GARDEN - AS BEFORE

Larry listening, shaking his head.

                    ML CARR
          That’s what I’m saying. This city
          is racist. Good thing we got their
          GREAT WHITE HOPE!

The black players are laughing. Larry is not. Doesn’t like
that monicker one bit and --


INT. BOSTON GARDEN - NIGHT

We see his displeasure when Larry waits court-side before a
game as legendary Celtics announce JOHNNY MOST calls him out.

                    JOHNNY MOST (V.O.)
          At 6’10”, a forward from Indiana
          State. Number 33. Larry Bird.

-- and Bird takes the court to thunderous applause when --

A WHITE MASS-HOLE FAN opens a brown paper bag and releases a
WHITE DOVE that flutters up to the rafters.

Off Larry’s displeasure we CUT BACK TO:


EXT. RED CLAY TENNIS COURT - AS BEFORE

Larry and Red, getting into it on the court.

                    LARRY
          This city -- they all want   me to be
          something but I don’t give   a shit
          about race. I don’t have a   problem
          anyone that goes out there   to win.

                    RED AUERBACH
          Larry, and that’s why they love
          you. You’re the most competitive
          person I’ve ever seen in my life.

                    RED AUERBACH (CONT'D)
          But you have to take a break now
          and then. Take a day or two off.

                    LARRY
          You get paid for a job, you better
          show up for work.

                    RED AUERBACH
          You’re playing 43 minutes a game --

                    LARRY
          You pay me for 48.

                    RED AUERBACH

7-YEAR-OLD LARRY watches his father, JOE BIRD, squeeze a
swollen, broken, black and blue foot into a work boot and
head limping out the door for a shift as we --

Larry, remembering.

                    RED AUERBACH
          Is it true you’ve been sleeping at

Off Larry, who can’t lie --

INT. CELTICS’ LOCKER ROOM, BOSTON GARDEN - MORNING

A JANITOR vacuums the empty, Celtic’s locker-room, surprised
to find its star player, asleep in his warm-ups on the floor.

Larry’s awakened by the whir of the machine and --


INT. BOSTON GARDEN - DAY

While the ARENA CREW lays the parquet and sets up the seats --
                                                          59.


Larry runs laps around the empty rafters of the stadium
before any other player’s even here.

Finally, on the court, M.L. arrives in street clothes, with
KEVIN McHALE at his side. (6’10”. Whiter than death.
Shoulders so wide it looks like he forgot to remove the coat
hanger from his shirt. Super laid back.)

They look up at Larry, jogging around in the stands.

                    M.L. CARR
          Hey Kevin, you’re white. Why aren’t
          you working like that?

                    MCHALE
          Hey, man. I’ve got a life.

They both laugh at that as Larry keeps running --

                    RED AUERBACH (V.O.)
          You don’t slow down now and then,
          and you’re going to get hurt.

EXT. RED CLAY TENNIS COURT - AS BEFORE

Red, still laying into Larry, who walks back onto the court.

                    LARRY
          We come to play tennis or what?

                     RED AUERBACH
          I’m trying to look out for you,
          son. Careers are short in the
          league. You need to take care of
          your body.

                    LARRY
          You don’t worry about that, Red. My
          body’s just fine.

Off Red’s incredulity, we --

BOOM! Larry flying into the stands, diving after a ball and --

BAM! Larry’s catching a wicked elbow in the face in a game
against Milwaukee that shatters his eye socket.

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. CELTIC’S LOCKER ROOM - LATER

Larry entering the locker room, blood all over his jersey, to
the high fives of his team.

                    MCHALE
          Hell of a game tonight, Birdie.
          Can’t believe you stayed in.

                    LARRY
          Couldn’t leave it to you guys. I
          actually wanted to win.

McHale laughs. Larry sneezes, popping his eye literally out
of his socket. It’s incredibly gross.

                    MCHALE
          Might want to get that checked out.

                                                CUT BACK TO:


EXT. RED CLAY TENNIS COURT - DAY

Larry and Red, as before.

                    RED AUERBACH
          You want to win, you need to be
          able to walk. And maybe see out of
          both eyes. You got everything,
          Larry. Maybe try to enjoy it.

                    LARRY
          Me and Dinah, we’re good.
          I’m enjoying it. See.

                    RED AUERBACH
          That’s not what the other guys say.

Larry tries to shrug that off as we --

INT. OUT OF TOWN LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Post game and in street clothes, the Celtics drink canned
beer from a cooler, stocked by the home team.

                    MCHALE
          Hey Larry, you coming? Danny knows
          some girls at the bar.
                                                          61.


                    LARRY
          Nah you guys good ahead. I’m gonna
          hit the hotel.

McHale watches Larry loading a PILLOWCASE full of beer.

                    MCHALE
          You know, we’re supposed to leave
          those for the next team?

                    LARRY
          Fuck the next team. We won.

McHale heads out with a laugh. Larry packs up more beer and --


INT. OUT OF TOWN HOTEL - A FEW HOURS LATER

Larry sits in his hotel, having crushed most of the beers,
obsessively reading the SPORTS PAGE which is all about --

Magic. His box scores. His triumphs. His flamboyant personal
life. Larry drinks and consumes it as --

                                                CUT BACK TO:


EXT. RED CLAY TENNIS COURT - AS BEFORE

Red and Larry, wrapping up their heart to heart.

                    RED AUERBACH
          The thing about competition, Larry
          is, it can push you. It can drive
          you to accomplish incredible things
          but it can also destroy you and
          blind you. You need to live your
          life, son, because believe me,
          Magic -- he’s out there living his.

AND WE END SEQUENCE ON:


INT. OUT OF TOWN LOCKER ROOM - THAT NIGHT FROM BEFORE

Larry, the beers all run out, littering his hotel room. The
TV flickering on screen, playing Magic’s highlights.
Graceful. Joyous. Alive. Off, Larry’s contempt --

EXT. MAGIC’S NEW BEL AIR MANSION - DAY

A ROLLS ROYCE pulling through the gates of a sprawling Bel
Air Estate where --

Magic waits at the door as Dr. Buss (and DATE) exit the car.

                    MAGIC
          What do you think? Not Pickfair,
          but not bad.
              (Dr. Buss is impressed)
          C’mon. I’ll give you a tour.


INT. MAGIC'S NEW BEL AIR MANSION - DAY

Like Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights, Magic tours Buss through
his palatial five bedroom, five bath, Tudor-style home where -

A lavish, debaucherous HOUSE PARTY rages. Beautiful, scantily
clad young women mingling with NBA PLAYERS and MOVIE STARS.

Magic walks Buss though THE LIVING ROOM.

                    MAGIC
          This is the parlor. All this
          fabric’s from Turin. That’s Italy.

IN THE MUSIC ROOM

Magic shows Buss a wood paneled, in wall, custom stereo
system Rick Rubin would envy.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          I had the Jackson Five in here
          yesterday. Said it sounds better
          than the studio.

Magic cranks up the speakers blasting BILLIE JEAN. Prophetic.

  “People always told me, be careful who you love...”

IN A SPACIOUS BEDROOM

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          It’s got five bedrooms total. One
          is just for my mother, but this one
          I call the Isaiah room. He’s even
          got his own key.

Right on cue, ISAIAH THOMAS (the NBA’S RESIDENT ASSHOLE and
paradoxically, Magic’s best friend) steps out in his bathing
suit, arm draped around a YOUNG WOMAN.
                                                         63.


                    ISAIAH
          How’s it going, Dr. Buss? When you
          gonna get me out to The Lakers?

                    DR. BUSS
          I’ve got a point guard already.

He gestures, displeased, to the COKE MUSTACHE Isaiah’s
sporting. Off Isaiah, embarrassed, wiping his nose and --

FINALLY, AT THE POOL

-- Magic leads Buss around a kidney shaped pool swimming with
starlets. People fuck right out in the open. Doing blow off
the bar. It’s a hedonist’s paradise.

Buss puts his arm around Magic.

                    DR. BUSS (CONT’D)
          I had a feeling that money was
          going to a good cause.

                    MAGIC
          Not everyone feels that way. Lotta
          the guys, they’re not happy. Don’t
          think me and you should be friends.

                                                    CUT TO:


INT. LAKERS’ LOCKER ROOM, FORUM - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Magic dresses at his locker, getting an earful from his team.

                    KAREEM
          He’s your owner. Not your brother.
          And he’s no more a doctor, than
          fucking Dr. J is a surgeon.

                    MAGIC
          He’s got a PHD in something.

                    COOPER
          Yeah. Pussy.

They all laugh.

          Cause sometimes I don’t know. Are
          you a player or management?

Kareem heads out, leaving Magic confused.

                    MAGIC
          I don’t know what that means.

                    COOPER
          25 Million for 25 years? Sounds
          like ownership money to me.

                    NIXON
          Plus you making decisions, like
          you’re in the front office. Magic
          wants Westhead gone -- poof! The
          coach disappears.

                                               FLASH CUT TO:

A VERY AWKWARD PRESS CONFERENCE IN THE FORUM CLUB. (We’ll be
here for another one of these in a few years.) Dr. Buss, at
the podium with JERRY WEST and PAT RILEY (The suave, slick-
haired, Gordon Gekko of the NBA.)

                    DR. BUSS
          We thank Paul Westhead for his
          great work but we have appointed
          Jerry West as offensive Coach for
          the Lakers. Pat Riley will stay on
          as Coach.

Magic, defending his actions.

          Everyone wanted him gone. I love
          Paul, same as you, but he was
          slowing us down. I stuck my neck
          out to put Coach Riley in charge
          and not one of y’all got my back.

                    NIXON
          You don’t need us. You got Buss.

                     MAGIC (V.O.)
          The truth of it was, someone on the
          team had a big mouth, but it just

          I love Norm, but he’s jealous.
          Since the day you arrived.

          It’s more than just that. Some of
          the guys, worried too, I’m gonna
          rat on ‘em to you. After what
          happened with Landsberger.

                    BUSS
          What happened with Mark?

Magic rolling his eyes.

          Man, the kid has got to be the

MARK LANDSBERGER. A white. 6’8”. 230lb, sack of potatoes in a
Spalding jersey. Mark sits tying his shoes, only to get up
and trip. Discovering he’s tied both of his shoes together.

                    MAGIC (V.O.)
          He likes to party, like everyone.

For a prime example, we CUT TO:


INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

A huge line of COKE. Landsberger takes it down like a Dyson.
Pull out to reveal half of dozen Lakers player enjoying
Landsberger’s drugs in --

The Champagne room of a STRIP CLUB where Landsberger gets a
lap dance from a very large BLACK STRIPPER.

          The real problem was, he tells his
          wife fucking everything.


INT. MARK LANDSBERGER’S HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Marks sits on the sofa with HIS MIDWESTERN WIFE who eats ice
cream for the tub while he gives her a foot rub, telling
tales of his conquests.

          Who we fucked. Who he fucked.
          Everything that goes down on the

Push in on HIS WIFE, soaking the gossip up with her desert.

          You can even get in without Dr.

Dr. Buss works the room of Celebrities, Groupies, Playmates,

          It’s like you said, Dr. Buss.
          Showtime, this thing, it’s not just
          how you play the game. It’s the way
          you live your life. On the break.
          Every time. You don’t ever slow
          down and you don’t stop for
          nothing. Why would I live or play
          ball any other way?

Buss raises his glass to the bacchanal they’ve built.

                    DR. BUSS
          Magic, my son, I hope nobody stops
          you.

Larry stands center court, letting the chants of the Garden

          I’m Brent Musberger and in each of
          the last four NBA Championship
          Series, either Magic or Bird has
          competed. But this is the first
          time the two have gone head to head
          for the title. A dream match-up for
          fans and a league, revived by the
          bitter rivalry between the two
          stars finally competing tonight.

The chants start again, drowning Musberger out.

Magic just gives him a smile as --

A TITLE CARD READS:   GAME ONE

(And we’re in for a long sequence here. Imagine a title fight
in a Rocky Film. These games will be paced out like rounds.)

The teams set up for the tip. The ref tosses the ball and to
Larry’s chagrin, The Lakers hits the ground running.

Magic leads a four-on-two fast break -- dumps to Kurt Rambis -
- who gives-and-goes back to Magic who lays it in for two.

Off a missed-Larry jumper, Magic runs it coast to coast for a
score. And when Larry forces a jump pass, Magic picks it off
and hits a wide open Worthy for a wide open jam and --

Just like back in college, Magic’s team is too fast.

                    BRENT MUSBERGER (V.O.)
          And the Lakers steal the first game
          in Boston. There are just too much
          for the Celtics.

A TITLE CARD READS:   GAME TWO


INT. BOSTON GARDEN - NIGHT   (GAME 2)

-- and we’re right into the game. This one is hard fought.
Both team’s playing well. Larry comes out shooting well --

He hits a jumper at the line. A tough drive against Kareem.
                                                           75.


But L.A. is hot too. Kareem feeds a cutting Worthy with a
nifty little dime for a slam over three Celtics. Worthy dunks
again over Bird, sending Larry to the floor and --

With the 20 seconds left in the 4th, Lakers leading by two,
Kevin McHale’s fouled on his way to the rim. He misses the
shot, but will head to the line. The Celtics’ crowd roars.

                    BRENT MUSBERGER (V.O.)
          McHale will shoot two. He needs to
          make both to tie the ball game.

McHale steps to the line, looking nervous as shit. Knees
knocking together, aware of what’s on the line as --

JOHNNY MOST, the gravel-voiced Boston announcer lays it out.

                    JOHNN MOST (V.O.)
          And McHale’s ready. And the shot
          is...no good!

McHale misses the first shot. Sets up for the second and --

                    JOHNNY MOST (V.O.)
          Dips. Shoots and...does not get it!

He bricks the second, missing TWO FUCKING FREE THROWS with
the game on the line. Magic coming down with rebound and...

The Lakers bench starts celebrating. Nicholson in the crowd
makes the CHOKE sign to Kevin. Red stews in his seat.

                    BRENT MUSBERGER (V.O.)
          So the Lakers do not have to take a
          shot. They have it with 20 seconds
          to go and lead the Celtics 113-111.

ON THE CELTICS BENCH. Desperate times. Desperate measures.

                    M.L.
          We gotta come up with something.
          Somebody’s gotta make a play.

There’s nothing more to be said. They take the court.

                    BRENT MUSBERGER (V.O.)
          As Yoga Bera once, said, “it is
          getting late early.” The Lakers
          trying to make it 2-0 and go home
          to L.A. with a big cushion.

Worthy takes the ball out near the Lakers’ own basket. All
they have to do is run out the clock.
                                                         76.


He inbounds to Magic. Immediately double teamed. Gives it
back to Worthy who passes cross court to Bryon Scott only --

Gerald Henderson picks it off! Stealing the pass out of
nowhere, taking it in for a lay-up that ties up the game!

                    JOHNNY MOST (V.O.)
          A great play by Henderson! The
          Leperchaun at work here at the
          Garden! A steal right when you need
          it! It’s bedlam in Boston.

The Celtics go nuts. The Lakers can’t believe it. Pat Riley
screams for timeout, dragging his stunned team to the bench.

                    PAT RILEY
          All right. Shake it off. We got the
          ball. It’s not over. Get it into
          Kareem and put these fuckers down.

Riley draws up a play. With 13 seconds left, the game tied --

The Lakers inbound again. This time at half court. Magic gets
it with 10. Starts to dribble... and dribble... trying to get
it into Kareem only --

He loses track of the time. And before Magic realizes what’s
happened, there’s just one second left and --

                    JOHNNY MOST (V.O.)
          He’s going to have to shoot it and
          he doesn’t get it off! He doesn’t
          get it off!

The Lakers don’t even get up a shot. Magic has blown it and
he can not believe it.

                    JOHNNY MOST (V.O.)
          He lost track of the time and now
          we’re headed to overtime.

The Lakers take the bench. Magic, gutted while in the
Celtics’ huddle, Larry knows they just got a new life.

                     LARRY
          We got ‘em by the balls. Don’t let
          go to get a better grip. Just keep
          squeezing.

And when overtime starts, the Celtics go for the kill. They
play hard and sharp, matching each basket until finally, they
have a chance to take the lead and --
                                                        77.


They swing the ball around the key to McHale - for a chance
at redemption - and he buries an arching twelve footer --

                    JOHNNY MOST (V.O.)
          -- it’s good! And Boston leads. 122
          to 121!

And GAME TWO is a wrap. The Lakers, deflated. Larry passes
Magic heading into the tunnel and points to the scoreboard.

                    LARRY
          Next time you need it, the clock’s
          right up there. See ya back in L.A.

We’re into the game and it’s a lighting fast pace. Maxwell

BOOM! Kareem swats it out of the sky. The ball lands with
Magic. He pushes the break. A dizzying four-on-one that ends
with a KURT RAMBIS dunk at the Forum crowd screaming.

And the whole game is like that. When Larry misses a three --

WHAM! The Lakers turn on the jets. Kareem outlets to Magic --
to Coop then to Worthy who stuffs it in for the jam!

On a timeout on the BOSTON BENCH, DANNY AINGE hangs his head.

          Only way we win this is if they
          pass out, have to forfeit the game.

Larry seethes, just stewing as he watches Magic and Worthy
slapping five. The Lakers fans going crazy as --

          This has to be one of the most
          decisive routs in Championship game
          history. The Lakers 137. The
          Celtics 104.

We follow Larry off the court, boiling over with anger and --


INT. VISITING TEAM LOCKER ROOM, FORUM - MOMENTS LATER

When Larry enters the locker room, he goes off on his team.

                    LARRY
          That was disgusting. Y’all played
          like a bunch of fucking pussies.
          I’m not watching Magic celebrate in
          front of me again.

He slams his a water bottle against the wall, scattering
teammates, and takes a seat at his locker.

A REPORTER APPROACHES.

                    REPORTER
          Tough night, Larry. They set the
          pace from the start. What do you
          have to do different tomorrow if
          you want to win?

Larry takes a moment to consider, knowing his teammates are
listening and Larry makes a decision.

                    LARRY
          It’s embarrassing. There’s no doubt
          about it. We’ve got some great
          players on this team, but we don’t
          have the players with the heart
          sometimes we need and uh today,
          when you see Magic, slapping high
          fives and guys going behind their
          back and shooting lay-ups on us all
          day long, it seems like someone
          would try and put a stop to it but
          until we get our hearts where we
          belong, we’re in trouble. We played
          like sissies.

Larry teammates have heard. McHale turns to Ainge.

                    MCHALE
          We can’t just let them dunk us all
          night. Gotta take some hard fouls.

                    DANNY AINGE
          Me?! I get booed in every stadium
          we’re in. I’m grabbing Magic,

          fucking lay someone out for once!

INT. FORUM - NIGHT

Kevin stands on the court, listening the Nation Anthem before
the start of Game 4, Larry right in his ear.

          No. More. Lay-ups.

Mchale hears him, loud and clear as --

TITLE CARD READS:       GAME FOUR

And midway through the third, McHale takes his shot. When the
Lakers push the break and Kurt Rambis soars for a dunk --

BOOM! (in one of the dirtiest plays in NBA History) - Kevin
McHale clotheslines Rambis clean out of the air, smashing him
hard to the ground like a bodyslam and --

All hell just breaks lose. Rambis gets to his feet charging
fists first at McHale. Both benches clear fast.

                    JOHNNY MOST (V.O.)
          Rambis was really decked by McHale
          and he didn’t like it at all!

The powder keg bursts. Pat Riley’s in flames. Even Kareem’s
on the hunt, rushing into the scrum until --

The Ref breaks them up, sending Rambis to the line. (Note: If
this was 2020, McHale would be locked up in jail. He didn’t
even get teched-up!)

But notice is served. If this was ROCKY 4, we know this
moment exactly. Drago’s been cut. The fight just turned and
THE REST OF THIS GAME IS A BRAWL. And no one is sparred.

Worthy’s knocked to the ground, flailing after a loose ball.

Cooper’s thrown three rows into the stands by Larry when he
takes out the ball and --

                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Bird backs up Michael Cooper into
          the photographer’s lane!

Magic’s shit-talked so bad by a bench-warming, towel waving
M.L., he’s about to start swinging.

                    M.L.
          Come on, Tragic. Just do it. Take
          one step across that line and I’ll
          knock your ass out.

Magic has to be held back until a REF intervenes to M.L.

                    REF
          Sit down and shut up or I’ll throw
          you out of this game?

                    M.L. CARR
          What do I care? Go ahead. Man, I’m
          not even playing.

Pat Riley’s livid, yelling. Even Kareem loses it. After
missing a skyhook from the post, he battles Larry for a
rebound when - POW! - Kareem throws an elbow at Larry’s jaw
and Larry jumps in his face!

                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Kareem swings the elbow and now
          he’s yelling at Larry Bird.

                    KAREEM
          White boy! I will kick your ass.

                    LARRY
          I’m standing right here. Come on!
          Let’s see it, Kareem.

He’s gotten under Kareem’s skin and that’s just how Larry
wants it. The benches clear again. Magic pulling Kareem away,
aware this is a street fight. Not Showtime.

With the Lakers on their heels, Larry walks right up to Coop.

                    LARRY (CONT’D)
          I’m about to wear your ass out.

Larry gets the ball at the top of the key, pumps Coop out of
his pants, driving clean by and knocking down a sweet J.

          35 seconds remain. Tied at 123.

Magic is at the line, shooting two for the lead. He puts up
the first shot and -- CLANK! He bricks it off the back iron.

                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          He misses the first.

Magic stews silently. The Celtics bench roars. M.L. Carr
waves a towel, screaming out loudly --

                    M.L. CARR
          Tragic Johnson! Tragic Johnson!

Larry, on the floor, can see Magic is rattled and --

                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Big free throw coming up.

Magic lines up the ball, puts up his shot and -- WOW!

                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Johnson misses them both! Bird with
          the rebound and the Celtics want a
          time out and a despondent Magic
          Johnson goes to the bench.

Magic can’t believe it. He heads to the bench, shaking his
head while Larry takes a seat as K.C. lines up a play.

                    K.C. JONES
          I want to get it inside. Get Rambis
          to switch and we’ll get the
          mismatch down low.

Larry has other plans.

                    LARRY
          Just get me the damn ball.

K.C.’s a bright guy so he wisely reconsiders.

                    K.C. JONES
          You heard what he said. Just get
          Larry the ball.

He gets position in the post with Magic right on his back.
Catches the feed, spinning back for a fade-away and --

WHOOSH! Larry swishes the game winner. It drops over Magic.

          125-123 and they’ll head back to
          Boston with the series tied up and
          with home court advantage!

The moment is magical. Revenge for Larry. Agony for Magic and
we get the sense now, this series will go to the wire as --

                                                         89.


                    LARRY
          Don’t you look so excited.

Mark laughs as Magic steps out of the limo, looking breezy
and cool.

                    MAGIC
          Isn’t this some kind of place?

                    LARRY
          How’s it going there, Earvin? Ready
          to get this thing over with?

                    MAGIC
          This is beautiful, Larry.
              (they shake hands)
          This is your family? Who we got?

                    LARRY
          My mother, Georgia Bird. My granny,
          Lizzie Kearns. My brother, Mark.
          Couple others. Don’t need to worry
          ‘bout them.

Magic shakes all their hands warmly and beaming.

                    MAGIC
          It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thanks
          for having me to your home.

Larry, rolling his eyes. His family, practically swooning.


EXT. OUTDOOR BASKETBALL COURT, GEORGIA’S HOUSE - LATER

The group has moved to Larry’s outdoor court where a
COMMERCIAL CREW is setting up. A HOLLYWOOD DIRECTOR (ideally
Jonathan) walks his stars through the scene.

                    DIRECTOR
          Larry, you’ll be on the court here
          when Magic pulls up in the limo.
          Rolls down his window and says...

                    MAGIC
              (easy as pie)
          “I heard converse made a pair of
          shoes for last year’s MVP.”

The director smiles. Waits for Larry’s response. Never comes.

                    DIRECTOR
          Ok. Larry -- your line.
                                                        90.


                    LARRY
          Now? All right. “Yep.”

He’s incredibly wooden.

                    DIRECTOR
          Ok. Ok. Great.
              (he means terrible)
          Now Magic gets out of the car and --

                    MAGIC
          “Well they made a pair of Magic
          shoes for this year’s MVP.”

                    DIRECTOR
          Wonderful. Then you’ll rip off your
          warm up pants and Larry you’ll toss
          him the ball as you say --

                    LARRY
          Sorry. I forgot. Hold on. Yeah --
          “Ok. Magic. Show me what you got.”

                    DIRECTOR
          Nice. Ok. We’ll keep working on
          that. Then you throw him the ball
          and you’ll play one on one.

They both freeze.

                    MAGIC
          Oh. Ok. So you want us to play?

                    DIRECTOR
          Well, sure, yeah, I thought --

The director proposes this innocently. What he does not
understand, these two men are enemies. Their armor always on.

                    LARRY
          Want us to play, fine by me.
          Bring that weak shit to the hole,
          I’ll send it back to L.A.

                    MAGIC
          Oh, you think you can guard me?

                    LARRY
          Man, I don’t even have to. I’ll
          just leave you alone, you’ll
          probably dribble out the clock.

Watching from the sidelines, Mark Bird guffaws at that one.
                                                        91.


                    MAGIC
          All right, Larry. Let’s go. You’re
          not gonna have Gerald Henderson to
          save your ass now.

They both gear up for battle. It’s about to get ugly until --

                    DIRECTOR
          Whoa whoa guys, hold on. You’re not
          actually playing. It’s just for
          fun. It’s pretend.

                    LARRY
          Just a fun game? That’s all?

                    MAGIC
          All right. I can do that.

Relief falls over both.

                    DIRECTOR
          The crew’s going to set up. Why
          don’t you guys take a seat. This is
          going to be great.
              (but as he walks away)
          Jesus Christ. Kill me now.

While the crew sets up the shot, Larry and Magic take a seat
on the bench. Letting their guards down a bit.

                    MAGIC
          I’m glad we don’t have to play. I
          wasn’t trying to go hard right now.

                    LARRY
          Yeah, me neither. My back.

                    MAGIC
          Oh yeah. What’s going on? Didn’t
          look bad playing us... for a white
          guy, I mean.

                    LARRY
          C’mon, man. Not you too?

Magic starts laughing.

                    MAGIC
          I’m just kidding, Larry. You know
          Isaiah’s an idiot.

                    LARRY
          An idiot who’s your best friend.
                                                          92.


                    MAGIC
          Don’t mean, I agree what he said.

                                               SMASH CUT TO:


THE IDIOT IN ACTION: ISAIAH THOMAS’ INFAMOUS 1985 POST-DEFEAT
LOCKER ROOM INTERVIEW. HE’S SPECTACULARLY PETTY.

                    ISAIAH (ON TV)
          I think Larry is a very, very good
          basketball player. I think he’s an
          exceptional talent, but I’d have to
          agree with Rodman. If he was black,
          he’d be just another good guy.

                                                CUT BACK TO:


AS BEFORE, LARRY AND MAGIC ON THE BENCH

Larry’s non-plussed.

                    MAGIC
          He was just sore you beat him that
          series and stole that damn pass.

                    LARRY
          Yeah, I bet that that stung.
              (they both enjoy that)
          Honestly, I don’t care. Just pissed
          me off I had to talk to the press
          and not focus on you.

Magic respects Larry largess. Takes a new stock of him now.

                    MAGIC
          So what’s up with your back? Did
          you hurt it “not” jumping?

                    LARRY
          Actually hurt it out here. Digging
          the ditch for the drain.

                    MAGIC
          Wait. I’m sorry. Hold on. Larry
          Bird’s out here digging a ditch?

Magic considers this curiously. Notices a TRACTOR nearby.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          You don’t ride that thing do you?
                                                         93.


                    LARRY
          ‘Course. I cut that field everyday.

                    MAGIC
          Come on. Get the hell out?

Both men finally laugh.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          It’s a pretty nice spread. This is
          really where you play?

                    LARRY
          If it’s not too rainy or windy,
          this is where I do all my work.
          Where you do yours? The Playboy
          Mansion?

Magic laughs. So does a Bird.

                    MAGIC
          You’re a straight shooter. I like
          that. Just like on the court.

And they sit there together. A little thaw in the ice and --


EXT. OUTDOOR BASKETBALL COURT, GEORGIA’S HOUSE - LATER

AS WE MONTAGE THROUGH THE COMMERCIAL SHOOT: We see the start
of a friendship begin between the two men.

They laugh when Larry fumbles his lines and when MAGIC RIPS
OFF HIS WARM-UPS in an iconic shot of the spot. Slap five
when Larry hits a tough jumper and generally, just shoot the
shit, walking together through the fields on their breaks.

In the short time together, they are growing a bond and --

THE MONTAGE ENDS WHEN:

                    FIRST A.D.
          All right, guys. That’s lunch.

The crew starts to break. Magic heads off toward his trailer.

                    LARRY
          Where you going? This way.

                    MAGIC
          To my trailer, for lunch.
                                                           94.


                    LARRY
          Uh uh. Come on. My mom fixed lunch
          at the house.

Off Magic’s surprise. Mark Bird points to the limos.

                    MARK
          We can give you a lift. Don’t think
          you can get there in those.

Larry and Mark share a mischievous grin and --


EXT. GEORGIA BIRD'S NEW FRENCH LICK HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Magic’s holding on for dear life on the back of a 4-WHEELER
as Mark and Larry drive him through the farm.

                    LARRY
          You all right back there, Earvin?

                    MAGIC
          I guess this is what passes for a
          convertible here.

The Bird boys both laugh as they arrive at their mom’s house
where Georgia waits in an apron. No hugs or kisses, just --

                    GEORGIA BIRD
          Get on in. Wash your hands. Lunch
          is out on the porch.

But when it’s Magic’s turn to enter, she gives him a big hug.

                    GEORGIA BIRD (CONT’D)
          We’re so glad to have you. You’re
          my number one favorite player.

Larry rolls his eyes. Knew this was coming.

                    LARRY
          She said the same thing to Isaiah.
          ‘Fore she knew he was an asshole.

And Magic’s busting a gut, as he follows Larry off toward --


EXT. PORCH, GEORGIA BIRD'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

-- where the whole gang enjoys a fried chicken lunch.
Everyone busting balls. Mark is telling a story.
                                                    95.


                    MARK
          ...and then Larry come home, after
          playing in that tournament, saying,
          Mark -- I just played with the best
          guy I’ve ever seen.

Larry is cringing.

                    MAGIC
          Larry said that about me?

                    LARRY
          That’s not how I remember it.

                    MAGIC
          What I remember’s you dipping out
          the backdoor when the reporters
          came in.

                    LARRY
          Can show you how to do that
          sometime. You know it’s possible,
          actually, to not talk to a camera.

                    MAGIC
              (laughs)
          I’ll leave that to you. Magic
          doesn’t go out the side door.
              (to Mark)
          I didn’t mean to interrupt. What
          else he said about me?

                    MARK
              (loves rubbing it in)
          He said you were great. Just had
          the whole frickin’ game. Naturally,
          I didn’t believe it. But then you
          beat him in college and he took it
          real hard and I sat there as he
          cried and said -- Larry, you’re
          right. He’s a lot better than you.

The table dies laughing. Larry’s red in the face.

                    LARRY
          See with family like this, playing
          The Lakers ain’t nothing.

                    GEORGIA
          Could I get you more, Earvin?
                                                         96.


                    MAGIC
          Yes, ma’am. It’s terrific. Haven’t
          eaten like this since was home with
          my folks. Think y’all’d get along.

Georgia serves Magic a plate as he absorbs the surreal scene.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          It’s just crazy, isn’t it? Did you
          ever imagine that your son would
          become so rich and famous?

                    GEORGIA
          I’m just happy he graduated.

                    LARRY
          We gotta do this again?

                    MAGIC
          You know, I talked to Coach Knight.
          You had stayed at Indiana, we might
          both of been there. Wouldn’t that
          of been something. Why’d you leave
          so quick anyway?

Larry cuts his mom a look --

                    GEORGIA
          Don’t look at me? Earvin asked?

                    LARRY
          There’s nothing really to tell.
          30,000 people wasn’t my idea of
          school. More like a country, to me.

                                                    CUT TO:


INT. UNIVERSITY OF INDIANA - DAY (FLASHBACK 1976)

18-year-old Larry, with the one bag of shit he took with him
in the car, stands on the quad of the sprawling campus,
watching hundreds of WORLDLY STUDENTS stream by around him --

                    LARRY (V.O.)
          I roomed with this player, nice guy
          named Jim Wisman, but we were from
          different worlds...


INT. LARRY’S UNIVERSITY OF INDIANA DORM ROOM - DAY (1976)

Larry’s in his new college dorm room, unpacking his one bag
of shit. Two jeans. Two shirts. Two pair of shoes while --
                                                        97.


His SCHOOL TIES roommate, JIM WISMAN, unpacks a menagerie of
SPORTS COATS, SLACKS and SHOES from a steamer trunk.

                    LARRY (V.O.)
          He had different outfit for
          different meals. Man, I didn’t have
          nothing.


INT. COLLEGE RESTAURANT - DAY (1976)

Larry sits alone. A bowl of soup and the check. Counting out
some coins from his pocket while --

COLLEGE KIDS all around him eat carefree with their friends.

                    LARRY (V.O.)
          Didn’t take a week and a half ‘fore
          I knew it wouldn’t work.


INT. BASKETBALL FACILITY, UNIVERSITY OF INDIANA - DAY (1976)

The HOOSIERS warm up on the court. BOBBY KNIGHT at the helm,
aware someone is missing.

                    BOB KNIGHT
          Where the hell’s Bird?


EXT. HIGHWAY 37, BLOOMINGTON - DAY (1976)

Larry on the shoulder of the highway, with that same shitty
bag, thumbing it for a ride out of town.

A TRUCK finally pulls over and Larry jumps in and it pulls
off down the road and that’s the end of that --


EXT. GEORGIA BIRD'S HOME - AFTER LUNCH (PRESENT 1986)

Larry’s story continues after lunch is complete, walking with
Magic through the fields.

                    LARRY
          Didn’t even tell Coach I was
          leaving.

                    MAGIC
          How’d that go around here?

Larry’s look says -- not well.
                                                             98.


                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          You didn’t wanna go back?

                    LARRY
          We hit some hard times for awhile.
          You know, my dad passed away.

                    MAGIC
          I didn’t know, Larry. I’m sorry.

                    LARRY
          That’s all right. I’m OK. It’s just
          something that happened. He’d been
          through a lot in his life and he
          just did what he had to.

Magic is floored.

                    MAGIC
          Were you guys pretty close?

                    LARRY
          Oh, yeah. We were best friends. We
          did everything together.

Off Larry remembering, a FLASH OF IMAGES appears:

YOUNG JOE and YOUNG LARRY, fishing together at the lake.
YOUNG JOE and YOUNG LARRY, shooting hoops till it’s dark --

                                                   CUT BACK TO:

Larry, remembering. Stoic.

                       LARRY (CONT’D)
          He and    mom got divorced. Fell
          behind    on his payments. Police came
          to his    parents’ house where he
          lived,    going to take him away...


INT. LARRY’S GRANDPARENT’S HOUSE - DAY (1977)

Joe Bird (50) talks with a SMALL TOWN POLICEMAN. They go back
a million years. Everyone’s friend around here.

                    JOE BIRD
          Can I have a couple hours to get my
          things straightened out?

Joe watches the policeman depart, his mind already made up.

                    LARRY (V.O.)
          He went to the bar. Ordered a beer.
                                                        99.


INT. LOCAL BAR, FRENCH LICK - DAY (1977)

Joe leans up to the bar of his local town haunt.

                    JOE BIRD
          Can I get a half pint of Velvet?

The BARTENDER pours Joe the beer. Joe takes a sip like it’s
gold, then walks out with the glass --

                    BARTENDER
          Hey Joe! The glass! Where you
          going?


INT. LARRY’S GRANDPARENT'S HOUSE - DAY

The half pint still in hand, Joe Bird walks in the door, sits
down and picks up the phone.

                    LARRY (V.O.)
          He called my mother at home. Told
          her that he loved her and what he
          planned to do and... that was that.

Joe hangs up the phone beside the sweating glass of beer
which we pan past to see -- A SHOTGUN at his side. Joe Bird
considers it and --


EXT. LARRY’S GRANDPARENT'S HOUSE - DUSK

BOOM! A gunshot echoes out, scattering birds into the sky as -


EXT. GEORGIA BIRD'S HOME - AFTER LUNCH (PRESENT 1986)

Magic listens, just stunned. The shotgun blast echoing out
across the Indiana sky where Larry wraps up the story.

                    LARRY
          He kinda quit on us so -- took some
          time before school.

                    MAGIC
          Jesus, Larry. I’m sorry.

                     LARRY
          It’s ok. Like I said, it’s just
          something that happened. Took me
          out of the game for awhile but I
          hardly think about it now.
              (then)
          I’m gonna go get up some shots.
                                                       100.


And then Larry walks off to the court, leaving Magic just
speechless. Watching Larry shoot in the distance and --


EXT. GEORGIA BIRD'S NEW FRENCH LICK HOME - NIGHT

The shoot’s finally wrapped. Magic says goodbye to Larry’s
family, hugging his mother. Finally meets up with Larry.

                    MAGIC
          I’m glad we did this. Nice to meet
          the real Larry Bird.

                    LARRY
          Nice to finally meet Earvin, too.
          Don’t forget that he’s in there.

Larry sticks out his hand. Fuck that. Magic gives him a hug.

                    LARRY (CONT’D)
          Don’t try that when we play. I’m
          not Isaiah. Don’t kiss me.

                    MAGIC
              (laughs)
          Take it easy, Larry. Give that back
          of yours a break.

                    LARRY
          I’ll slow down when you do. Don’t
          leave your best work in sheets.

Magic laughs, driving off in his limo, not quite ready to
heed that advice and --


INT. FORUM - DAY (A FEW MONTHS LATER)

Magic walks on the court for first day of preseason, greeting
everyone joyously. COOP and BYRON SCOTT greet him, giggling.

                    MAGIC
          What up fellas? How’s your summer?

                    COOP
              (mimicking Bird)
          “Okay Magic. Show me what you got?”

Scott rips off his warm-ups, mimicking Magic’s performance.

                    SCOTT
          Choose your weapon!

They both bust up laughing.
                                                        101.


                    MAGIC
          All right. Very funny. When y’all
          get a commercial, you can make fun
          of my acting. Until then, shut up.

They’re still rolling in stitches when Pat Riley approaches.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          Everyone’s a critic now, huh?

                    RILEY
          You shouldn’t have done it. You set
          the examples for this team and that
          makes it looks like we’re soft. I
          hope you left that grab-assing shit
          in French Lick.

Riley heads off. Magic, a bit stunned. Dr. Buss arrives next.

                    DR. BUSS
          Don’t worry about Pat. Guy wins a
          few rings, starts to think he’s a
          genius. Come over here. I want you
          to meet someone new.

Buss leads Magic over toward a strapping, bright eyed, jheri
curled, choir-boy ROOKIE.

                    DR. BUSS (CONT’D)
          Magic -- A.C. Green. He’s the new
          kid from Oregon.

                    MAGIC
          Nice to meet ya. You ready to work?

                    A.C. GREEN
          Yes, sir. Born ready. “For as the
          body without the spirit is dead, so
          faith without works is dead also.”

AC smiles, sprints off running laps. Magic cuts Buss a look.

                    DR. BUSS
          Virgin.

Magic’s jaw hits the hardwood and --


I/E. LAKERS’ BUS - (MOVING) NIGHT (A FEW WEEKS LATER)

The Lakers ride late at night. Most of the team is asleep.
But A.C. is up, studying the bible by his seat light when --
                                                       102.


                    MAGIC (O.S.)
          I got a question for you.

Magic takes the empty seat beside him. A.C. is surprised.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          Is it true in college, you
          boycotted the school bookstore
          cause they’re selling Playboy?
              (A.C. nods)
          You never been with a women?

                    A.C. GREEN
          Premarital sex is a sin.

                    MAGIC
          Is that right? I’m gonna make you a
          bet... two months. That’s how long
          I give you before you’re a sinner
          like us. Cause once you see all
          these ladies, the only book you’re
          going to boycot is that.

He points to the Bible, giving A.C. a wicked smile and --


EXT. NEW YORK HOTEL - NIGHT

When A.C. departs the bus at their New York Hotel, his knees
already shake seeing the line-up of KNOCKOUTS waiting outside
the door. Magic walks by, with a “told you so” laugh and --


INT. A.C.’S HOTEL ROOM - A FEW HOURS LATER

Like he’s warding off evil spirits, A.C. paces the room with
his bible, SINGING HYMNS at the top of his lungs trying to
drown out -- the chorus of WOMEN KNOCKING ON HIS DOOR.

                    WOMEN (O.S.)
          Come on, baby! Let us in. We won’t
          bite. Unless you ask.

A.C. belts his prayers louder as --


INT. OUTSIDE A.C.’S ROOM, HOTEL - NIGHT

Magic listens to his songs, standing with THREE WOMEN, trying
in vain to tempt A.C. out. It’s not going to happen.

                      WOMEN
          His loss.
                                                       103.


                    MAGIC
          Got a pretty good voice, though.

The ladies agree, leading Magic off to his room, where he
follows them inside, shutting us out with the door as --

WE MONTAGE THROUGH SOME PRETTY DEBAUCHEROUS YEARS WHERE:

Magic doinks two women in the Forum Club bathroom and --

He bones ANOTHER WOMAN at a Pool Party at his house and --

He balls ANOTHER WOMAN BACKSTAGE at a JACKSON FIVE SHOW and --

At the Playboy Mansion and Donald Sterling’s Malibu house and
nn New York. And Detroit. And Miami. Magic is in so much
tail, he can’t come up for air as we hear --

                    COOP (PRE-LAP)
          Nah. There isn’t a problem.


I/E. MAGIC’S MERCEDES - DAY

Coop is on the CAR PHONE in Magic’s MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE,
cruising down RODEO DRIVE. Talking to --

                    PAT RILEY (FILTERED)
          I’m worried that he’s distracted.
          Magic’s gotta slow down.

INTERCUT WITH:


INT. PAT RILEY’S OFFICE, FORUM CLUB - DAY

Riley, in his office overlooking the court, combing his hair.

                    PAT RILEY
          We can’t have him burn out.

                    COOP
          He’s the MVP of the league and we
          just won back to back titles. You
          want Magic to slow down?

                    PAT RILEY
          There’s plenty of ways to burn out.
          I love Dr. Buss but --

                    COOP
          I’m not getting in the middle of
          that. Coach, I hear your concern
          but -- Magic is fine.
                    (MORE)
                                                       104.

                    COOP (CONT'D)
          The guy is a prince. My car’s in
          the shop, he lent me his for a
          month. I’m driving it right now. I
          wouldn’t change him one bit.

                    PAT RILEY
          Nobody’s talking about change, I’m
          just saying be careful. You run an
          engine too hot, eventually they
          explode. He’s not actually Magic.

                    COOP
          Are you sure of that, Pat?

Coop hangs up the phone and we end with him driving, enjoying
the Beverly Hills air when --

BOOM! Out of nowhere, the hood of the car explodes in flames.
Coop, understandably panics, trying to get the car off the
road before he burns up inside it and --


INT. MAGIC JOHNSON’S NEW BEL AIR MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

Magic’s on the phone in his bathroom in a robe.

                    COOP
          Man, I don’t know what happened. It
          just burst into flames.

                     MAGIC
          Oh my god! Coop, that’s terrible.
              (beat)
          We’re you able to save the phone
          numbers I had in the glove box?

INTERCUT NOW WITH:


EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY

Coop, standing on a sidewalk, flocked with WASPY onlookers,
carphone case in his hand, talking with Magic as FIRE
FIGHTERS spray down Magic’s smoking Mercedes.

                    COOP
          The numbers? Did you hear me? Your
          hundred thousand dollar car just
          blew up on the street -- I’m ok, by
          the way.
                                                          105.


                    MAGIC
          Yeah, I heard you. It’s cool. But
          can you go grab those numbers from
          the box? I got a girl I need to
          call. Coop, I can’t lose that
          number.

Coop stares off at the smoldering carcass of the car --

                    COOP
          I’ll let you know where they take
          it. But Earvin, think you might
          need some help.

Coop hangs up the phone as this time we end on:

Magic in his bedroom which we now see is occupied by SIX
WOMEN, passed out on his bed. The sounds of a party, heard
raging in the home all around him.

Hold on Magic in this moment, maybe beginning to agree while -


EXT. BOSTON GARDEN - NIGHT

Back in Boston, Larry’s facing some hard truths as well. His
back in a brace, he shuffles into the Garden beside M.L.

                    ML CARR
          When they going to do one of me?

                    LARRY
          Maybe when you get a jump shot.

M.L.’s referring to the famous WOODEN STATUE OF LARRY on
exhibit outside the arena.

                    ML CARR
          Motherfucker. At least I can jump.
          That thing moves better than you.
          They need to add a few pounds, they
          wanna make it more accurate.

Larry can’t argue with that and --


INT. BOSTON GARDEN - A FEW HOURS LATER

Larry battles MICHAEL JORDAN and the Bulls in the Garden,
having a pretty bad night. Jordan, younger, ascendant, a
different caliber of athlete, puts on a show while --

Larry, back breaking in pain, watches large stretches of the
game from the bench. Well actually --
                                                       106.


From the floor by the bench where he lays on his stomach,
trying to soothe his bad spine. And when he gets in the game -

CLANK! Larry puts up a brick, cursing his broken fingers,
still mangled from that long ago bar brawl.

                    JORDAN
          Thought you shot better than that.

Jordan takes the ball down and hits a J in Larry’s face.

                    JORDAN (CONT’D)
          Take that, All-Star.

                     LARRY
          Come on, you little bitch. Bring it
          back here.

Summoning his resolve, Bird runs down the wing and drains a
THREE in Jordan’s face. Jordan shakes his head.

                    JORDAN
          Man, you’re the biggest prima donna
          I’ve ever seen.

                    BIRD
          What the hell’s a prima donna?

Bird runs off past him, bumping Jordan’s shoulder, only we
can see Larry’s hurting. He’s still got the talent and drive,
but his body is failing. He can barely stand up.

                    DAN DYREK (PRE-LAP)
          You need surgery, Larry. It’s not
          gonna get better.


INT. DAN DYREK’S OFFICE - DAY

Larry sits in DAN DYREK’s PHYSICAL THERAPIST’S OFFICE. X-RAYS
of his back on the screen. Red looks on at his side.

                    DAN DYREK
          You’ve lost the structural
          stability in your spine so when you
          run. When you jump, it slips out of
          position and compresses your
          nerves. That’s like slamming your
          finger in a door, and somebody
          keeps shutting it harder.

                    LARRY
          Well, good thing I can’t jump.
                                                         107.


                    RED AUERBACH
          Larry, this isn’t a joke.

                    DAN DYREK
          Now there is therapy we can try to
          strengthen the supporting muscles,
          try and lock it in place, but it
          won’t last forever.

                    RED AUERBACH
          How long you wanna go like this?
          You already did two Achilles.

                                               FLASH CUT TO:


INT. BOSTON GARDEN - NIGHT

Larry finishes a lay-up against the Pistons but crumples like
a ragdoll when he lands, clutching his ankles in pain and --


INT. BOSTON GARDEN TRAINING FACILITY - DAY

Larry, ornery and suffering, rides a stationary bike in his
practice uniform, with TWO BOOT CASTS on his feet.

                    RED AUERBACH (V.O.)
          You’re already in the hospital
          between games.


INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Larry lays on a hospital bed, trying to catch some sleep
between games. HIS BACK IN TRACTION and --

                                               CUT BACK TO:


INT. DAN DYREK’S OFFICE - DAY

As before. Red tries to talk sense to Larry.

                    RED AUERBACH
          I told you before, if you don’t
          start to slow down -- you won’t
          walk out of this game on your own.

                    LARRY
          And I told you -- I get paid for a
          job, I’m going to show up to work.
                                                       108.


                    RED AUERBACH
          Jesus, you’re stubborn.

                    LARRY
          I’ll do the therapy, fine, but I’m
          not getting no surgery. I do that,
          it’s over. You go under the knife,
          you don’t come back the same.

                    RED AUERBACH
          Everything ends eventually. What
          the hell’s left to prove?

Off Larry, who doesn’t quite have that answer and --


INT. LARRY’S BROOKLINE HOME - DAY

Larry lies on the floor, just like in the games, nursing his
back while his NEW BABY BOY swats at a ball in his nursery.

From the door, Dinah watches. Her heart, very full to see
Larry, a father. But she knows he’s in pain and --


INT. CELTIC’S BUS - NIGHT

Larry’s still contemplative on the bus to a game, seated in
the back beside Robert Parish, who’s got a smile on his face.

                    LARRY
          What’s so funny there, Chief?

                    ROBERT PARISH
          Nothing. Just thinking. You believe
          we get to do this? Get paid to play
          basketball? Sometimes, I just --

Robert trails off, grateful and wistful. Larry considers him,
weigh his future as THE ROAR OF A CROWD takes us into --


INT. BOSTON GARDEN - NIGHT

TITLE CARD READS: 1991 EASTERN CONFERENCE GAME 5.
               CELTICS VS PACERS. SERIES TIED 2 - 2

A tight, do or die battle. Larry is hurting, but going shot
for shot with Pacers stars, skinny REGGIE MILLER and thick
cut CHUCK PERSON. A heated shit talking battle when --

Larry, with the ball at the top of the key -- has it knocked
away by a defender. A mad scramble for the ball!
                                                       109.


Larry dives to the ground after it and -- BANG!

His head hits the floor hard, face smashing off the parquet
with a sickened CRACK that takes the air from the Garden.

The play continues around him but Larry lies on the floor,
unmoving. Unconscious. The crowd silent in shock and --

A FEW BREATHLESS MINUTES LATER

Dinah and the fans are in tears when Larry finally rises,
staggering into the tunnel, knocked out for the count and --

                    DOCTOR (PRELAP)
          Definitely have a concussion.


INT. CELTICS’ LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Inside the room, Larry’s on the training table. Doctors
blinding lights in his eyes. His face already bruised black.

                    DOCTOR
          You were out for three minutes. And
          your cheek’s broken too. You need
          to get to the hospital.

                    LARRY
          All right. After we win.

                    DOCTOR
          You can’t go back in the game! You
          get hit the face, you could do
          permanent damage.

Larry cuts Red a look. An understanding between them and --


INT. BOSTON GARDEN - A FEW MOMENTS

Dinah and the Celtics fans just explode when Larry Legend
runs out of the tunnel, unbuttoning his warm ups.

                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          And here comes Larry Bird! And not
          a moment too soon, with Indiana
          leading by two.

The moment is iconic. The Boston fans roar as Larry takes a
knee in front of the bench, itching to get back in the game.

The standing ovation washes over him. The emotion is
incredible. Even Larry can feel it.
                                                        110.


He retakes the court, walks right up to Chuck Person.

                    LARRY
          I’m gonna fucking put you in the
          ground.

Person is speechless, but there’s no doubt that he’ll do it.
We don’t even need to see the game because --


INT. CELTICS’ LOCKER ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

It’s over. The Celtics celebrating an unbelievable comeback
victory in the locker room, slapping Larry on the back.

He makes his way over to Red, absolutely exhausted. In agony.

                    RED AUERBACH
          You had 17 points in the fourth. If
          there was any debate about the best
          I’ve ever seen -- kid, you’re it.

                    LARRY
          Woulda had twenty, hadn’t missed
          that one three.

                    RED AUERBACH
          Son, that’s how you finish
          something. Remember this one.

Larry’s emotional at the words.

                    LARRY
          When the season’s over, I’ll do it.
          Tell Doc to set up the surgery.

Both men know what this means. They take a long moment and
then Larry Bird finally sits down as --

                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          And there he goes again. Kevin
          Johnson goes right by Bryon Scott.


INT. PHOENIX SUNS ARENA - NIGHT

Tiny, flat-topped, KEVIN JOHNSON takes Bryon to the hole. The
Phoenix crowd’s on their feet. Pat Riley’s apoplectic as --

A TITLE CARD READS: WESTERN CONFERENCE SEMIFINALS
                 GAME 4 - PHOENIX LEADS L.A. 2 - 1

And it goes on like this. Magic tries to will his team to
victory with a procession of sky hooks but each time he does -
                                                       111.


KJ answers back, dicing through the soft Lakers D.

                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Kevin Johnson, again penetrating.
          Puts a jumper off the glass!

He drives by Byron again. He feeds TOM CHAMBERS for jumpers.
He knocks down three after three and then finally -- KJ
steals a bounce pass from Magic, hits a streaking DAN MARLEY
for a slam that puts the nail in the coffin and --

Magic meets eyes with Riley, both of them ready to snap and --

                    PAT RILEY (PRE-LAP)
          Kevin-fucking-Johnson!


INT. VISITORS’ LOCKER ROOM - PHOENIX ARENA - LATER

The mood’s dark. The Lakers sit glumly, changing out of their
uniforms while Riley tears into their asses.

                    PAT RILEY
          You let Kevin-fucking-midget-ass-
          Johnson walk down the lane like
          he’s the Dali-fucking-Lama. You
          didn’t play any defense!

No one even reacts. Which makes Riley even madder.

                    PAT RILEY (CONT’D)
          What? You don’t care? Worthy,
          you’re fucking forcing up
          everything. Thompson, I don’t know
          what to say. You’re just a goddamn
          loser who belongs on a fucking
          loser team. You played like
          pussies. You don’t have any balls!
          Do you!? Do you? Cause you need
          ‘em? I got ‘em. Buck’s got ‘em!
          I’ve seen ‘em but the rest of you
          pussies -- the only guy who did
          anything on this whole sorry team
          is Buck, and we wasted 43 points
          and you guys don’t even care!

Despite all his theatrics, it appears that they don’t. Just
continuing to pack up, never acknowledging the tirade and --

Riley knows what this means. He’s lost them. He heads off to
bathroom, considering his hair in the mirror in a moment of
anguish and then --
                                                        112.


WHAM! He punches the glass, shattering his reflection into a
thousand fragmented pieces, ripping open his hand.

Magic turns at the sound, seeing Riley, bleeding badly all
over his custom-made sharkskin suit. He storms out the door.
Magic watches him go. No one saying a word and --


EXT. LAKERS’ TEAM BUS - LATER (MOVING)

As the team rides on the bus to the airport, the silence
continues. Riley sits alone in the front. Bandaged hand.
Broken ego. With the acute feeling, it’s over so --


INT. MAGIC’S BEL AIR MANSION - DAY (MONTHS LATER)

It should come as no surprise when Magic opens his door to
find Riley outside, tears already pooling his eyes.

                    RILEY (PRELAP)
          I just lost ‘em. I’m sorry.


EXT. MAGIC'S BEL AIR MANSION - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Riley sits with Magic by the pool. Nakedly emotional.

                    RILEY
          When you can’t get them to listen,
          when that happens, it’s over.

                    MAGIC
          Did you talk to Dr. Buss?

                    RILEY
          There will be a press conference
          tomorrow. Dunleavy’s taking over.

                    MAGIC
          Man, coach, I’m sorry.

                    RILEY
          I’ll land on my feet. I’m ok.
          We sure had a good run.

                    MAGIC
          Yeah. We ran the shit out.

And they sit there, nostalgic. The sun beginning to set as --

                    DOCTOR (PRE-LAP)
          Scalpel please, Doctor.
                                                       113.


INT. BOSTON HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Larry is out. Face down on the operating table with both
ACHILLES TENDONS under the knife simultaneously as --

TWO SURGEONS work in tandem, chiseling bones spurs out of
Larry’s peeled open heels and --


INT. ANOTHER BOSTON HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Larry’s face down on another operating table as another TEAM
OF SURGEONS remove an entire DISC from his spine.

                    SURGEON
          Good thing he’s so tall. Least it’s
          easier to see in here.

The surgeons laugh as they work, exhuming the bloody disc,
dropping into a silver bowl just like --


EXT. THE POOL, MAGIC’S BEL AIR MANSION - DAWN

Ice rattling in a highball glass as Dr. Buss pours himself a
rum and Coke and joins Magic in the hot tub.

                    DR. BUSS
          Hell of ride.

Around them -- a bleak scene. Literally the end of the party.
The place trashed. A few people passed out. A few others
stagger off toward their cars in the twilight.

Magic and Dr. Buss, the last people awake.

                    DR. BUSS (CONT’D)
          That was one for the books. What do
          you wanna do now?

                    MAGIC
          I don’t know, man. I’m beat. Don’t
          know who half of these people were.

                    DR. BUSS
          It’s a new crowd. I know.

                    MAGIC
          I mean, all this running. Makes me
          wonder if I left Earvin somewhere
          back there on the road?
                                                       114.


                     DR. BUSS
          I know what you mean. You’re so
          right. This is stale.
              (beat)
          Let’s drive to Tijuana. Catch a
          bullfight. Eat some tacos.

                    MAGIC
              (not what he’s getting at)
          You want to go to Mexico now?

                    DR. BUSS
          Yeah, man. Let’s go. I know a great
          place for breakfast. We can be
          there before seven.

                     MAGIC
          You can’t eat tacos at a bullfight?
          You know where the meat comes from
          don’t you?

                    DR. BUSS
          Why you never stop running. Ole!

Dr. Buss raises his glass. Magic toasts him, but he’s aware
they are riding the fumes of a party that’s already over.


INT. MAGIC’S MANSION - MORNING

A few hours later, as the CLEANERS sweep up the mess from
last night, Magic dials the phone. Placing a call to --

                    MAGIC
          Hey baby, it’s Earvin... yeah, it’s
          been a long time, but I’ve been
          missing my Cookie. If you got any
          time, maybe we oughta talk.

Magic is wistful, smiling at her response as ROBERTA FLACK
and DONNY HATHAWAY sing: “THE CLOSER I GET TO YOU” inside --


INT. UNION MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY

-- where Cookie, resplendent in her wedding dress, walks down
the aisle on the arm of her father toward --

Earvin, handsome in a white tux, waiting at the alter to
receive her and --
                                                         115.


EXT. UNION MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY

The newlyweds descends the steps of the small church in East
Lansing, cheered on by a small collection of their close
family and friends. Nothing SHOWTIME about it and --


INT. KELLOGG CENTER, MSU CAMPUS - DAY (A FEW HOURS LATER)

Cookie and Earvin dance at their reception on the campus
where they first met 14 years earlier.

                    MAGIC
          You happy now, baby?

                    COOKIE
          Yeah. I’m happy now, Earvin. Good
          things do come to those who wait.

Earvin and Cookie kiss as the dance. For the first time, in a
long time, Earvin’s at peace. IT DOESN”T LAST LONG.

                    COOKIE (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
          Where do you think this should go?


INT. MAGIC JOHNSON'S NEW BEL AIR MANSION - A FEW MONTHS LATER

Cookie (two months pregnant) sets up a nursery in one of the
bedrooms. Magic helps with the crib.

                    COOKIE
          Put it here. Think that’s good.

Magic sets down the crib, breathing hard for a moment.

                    COOKIE (CONT’D)
          It’s a preseason game. If you’re
          tired, tell Coach you can’t go.

                    MAGIC
          I already tried to get out of it,
          but it’s not fair to the fans. I’ll
          be back in two days. You change
          anymore bedrooms, Isaiah’ll be sad.

He kisses her as she laughs and --


EXT. SALT LAKE CITY - ESTABLISHING

The sun glistens off the Mormon kingdom where --
                                                         116.


INT. UTAH JAZZ, PRACTICE FACILITY - DAY

Magic is practicing with the Lakers in the UTAH ARENA.

A TITLE CARD READS:   OCTOBER 25, 1991

The team’s in town for an exhibition game against the Jazz. A
lot of new faces. Among them, MIKE DUNLEVAY - THE COACH.

Magic’s still in fine form, running fast breaks with the team
but at the end of the break, Magic doesn’t sprint back. He
pulls up, gassed. Sucking wind. Worthy slows up beside him.

                    WORTHY
          Hey Buck, you all right?

                    MAGIC
          Yeah. All good, man. I’m fine. Too
          much wedding cake, maybe.

Worthy laughs, running off. Magic mans up and joins him but --


INT. LOCKER ROOM, UTAH - LATER

-- after practice, Magic’s still tired and is bending the ear
of GARY VITTI, the LAKERS ATHLETIC TRAINER.

                    MAGIC
          I don’t know. Just feel heavy.
          Probably just need a day off.

                    GARY VITTI
          I’ll talk to the Coach. You’ll be
          fine. Get some rest. Welcome to
          married life, Magic.

Magic smiles, but belies a hint of concern and --


INT. SALT LAKE HILTON HOTEL - LATER

Taking Vitti’s advice, Magic’s napping pre-game in his room
when the bedside phone rings. It’s 2:15 pm. Magic answers.

                      MAGIC
          Hello?

                    DR. MELLMAN (FILTERED)
          Hey Earvin. Dr. Mellman. In L.A.

                    MAGIC
          Oh. How’s it going there, doc?
                                                       117.


                    DR. MELLMAN (FILTERED)
          Actually not very good. Something
          important’s come up. I need you to
          get on a plane back here now.

                    MAGIC
          Oh. Ok well -- I got a game in an
          bit. I can be there tomorrow.

                    DR. MELLMAN (FILTERED)
          No. You need to come now. There’s a
          flight in an hour. We’ll talk when
          you’re here.

Magic hangs up the phone, realizing something is wrong and --


INT. WAITING ROOM, DR. MELLMAN’S OFFICE, L.A. - HOURS LATER

Magic’s sitting beside Dr. Buss in the empty waiting room,
looking at a copy of EBONY on the table. On the cover:

MICHAEL JORDAN and his wife JUANITA.

Magic considers NBA’S biggest star when the door to the
Doctor’s office opens and DR. MELLMAN (Magic’s personal
physician) appears. His face, Ashen. Off Magic’s concern --

                    DR. MELLMAN (PRELAP)
          It showed up on the blood test they
          took for your life insurance. We’ve
          been trying to get answers.


INT. DR. MELLMAN'S OFFICE, LOS ANGELES - EVENING

Magic listens in shock as Dr. Mellman delivers the blow.

                    DR. MELLMAN
          Now, being H-I-V positive is
          different from having AIDS. There
          is big difference there and we will
          figure out a regimen.

Magic, completely numb. Hasn’t processed.

                    MAGIC
          Ok. All right. How long you think I
          need to sit out from the team?

Dr. Mellman and Buss share a look. Who’s going to tell him?
                                                       118.


                    DR. BUSS
          Earvin -- I’m sorry. You can’t play
          basketball anymore.

Magic, just speechless.

                    DR. MELLMAN
          Everyone ounce of strength you have
          needs to go to fighting this virus.

                    MAGIC
          You mean, I have to retire?

                    DR. MELLMAN
          There’s more to life than just
          basketball.

A very long beat.

                    MAGIC
          How long you think I have?

                     DR. MELLMAN
          You’re in a fight. We don’t know.
          Given your lifestyle, the nature of
          this virus, it could have been
          lurking in your body for years.
              (beat)
          Now of course, Cookie will have to
          get tested right away.

That threatens to bring Magic to his knees.

                    MAGIC
          What’s that mean for the baby?
          She’s two months pregnant.

                    DR. MELLMAN
          We don’t have all the answers yet.
          You just need to have faith. We
          will find a way through.

Off Magic, miraculously holding it together until --


EXT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

He exits the office with Buss and completely falls apart.

                    MAGIC
          I’m going to fucking die.
                                                        119.


                    DR. BUSS
          No you’re not. You’re a champ. If
          anyone can beat this, it’s you. You
          have me. You have Cookie. You’re
          gonna fight this like a game.

But Magic can’t hear him now. He is crying, afraid.

                    MAGIC
          How am I supposed to tell her?

But Magic must know, no one can help him with that and --


INT. MAGIC'S BEL AIR MANSION - LATER THAT NIGHT

Magic waits in his empty house for Cookie, who arrives home
from dinner, surprised to find him in L.A.

                    COOKIE
          Well that’s a surprise? Thought you
          weren’t getting home till tomorrow.

                    MAGIC
          I took an early flight back.
          Cookie, we need to talk.

Off Cookie, steadying herself for the blow of her life and --

A FEW HOURS LATER

The couple sits in the den. All wrung out of emotion.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          I don’t know what else to say. If
          you want to leave me, I get it. I
          wouldn’t blame you at all.

                    COOKIE
          Think I waited this long to just
          run out right now? Earvin, I’m not
          going anywhere. We’ll get through
          it together.

Incredible humbled, Earvin buries his head in her and cries.

                    MAGIC
              (after a very long beat)
          There’s still one other thing. I
          gotta start making calls. Dr. said
          it’s important I let people know --
          you know, that I may have infected.
              (silence)
          You understand what I’m saying?
                                                       120.


                    COOKIE
          You mean call other women?
              (off Magic’s nod)
          All right. So go do it. Gonna take
          you awhile.

Off Magic’s shame, we hear the RING OF THE PHONE INSIDE --


INT. MAGIC'S BEL AIR MANSION - NIGHT

-- where Cookie sits beside a locked office door. Tissues in
hand. Bible in lap. Listening to her husband on the phone --

                    MAGIC (O.S.)
          I know. I’m so sorry, just make
          sure you get tested. I will, Linda.
          You too.

She hears him hang up. Dial again. This will go on for hours.

                    MAGIC (O.S.) (CONT’D)
          Hey Monica, it’s Magic. Yeah, been
          awhile I know. No, I can’t. Sorry.
          Listen. There’s something I need to
          tell you. You might wanna sit down.

Cookie listens to them all, like she’s paying penance herself
until finally... WE HEAR ANOTHER PHONE RINGING INSIDE --


INT. LARRY BIRD’S BROOKLINE HOME - DAY

-- where Larry, still rehabbing from back surgery, sleeps on
the ground in a FIBERGLASS BRACE. Dinah (with their baby in
her arms) answers the phone.

                    DINAH
          Hello? It’s Dinah. Larry’s taking a
          nap. Can he call you back later?
              (her face falls)
          Ok. Hang on. One sec.

Appropriately worried, Dinah goes to rouse Larry.

                    DINAH (CONT’D)
          Hey, honey. Wake up. Think you need
          to get up. It’s your agent.

Slowly, Larry rises. The pain he’s in is tremendous.

                    LARRY
          I hate this damn thing. Makes me
          feel like a mummy.
                                                         121.


They share a sweet kiss as Larry hobbles to the phone.

                    LARRY (CONT’D)
          This better be good. You woke me up
          from a nap. They want another
          commercial?

                     BOB WOLF (FILTERED)
          No, Larry, they don’t. This isn’t
          going to be easy so I’m just going
          to tell you cause we don’t have
          much time.
              (beat)
          Magic’s retiring today. He’s got
          HIV. There’s going to be an
          announcement. He wanted you to know
          before the word hit the news.

Larry -- just staggered. Dinah watches him, scared.

                    LARRY
          What I can I do? What’s he need?

                    BOB WOLF (FILTERED)
          He’s ok. Just hang tight. He’ll
          call in a few days.

                    LARRY
              (just panicked)
          No. I need to talk him now. It
          can’t wait a few days.

                    BOB WOLF (FILTERED)
          I don’t know if you can. He’s got a
          press conference in an hour, but
          you can try him at home.

Larry hangs up the phone, immediately dialing again.

                    DINAH
          Larry, hey - what’s going on?

But he can’t find the words, frantically dialing the phone as-

WE INTERCUT WITH:


INT. MAGIC'S BEL AIR MANSION - SAME

Magic, in his palatial closet, trying to find a suit to wear
to the worst moment of his career when Cookie arrives.
                                                       122.


                    COOKIE
              (of the suits)
          What do you think of this blue? I
          was thinking something optimistic,
          you know. Show people I’m fine.

                    COOKIE (CONT’D)
          Earvin, Larry just called. Want me
          to tell him, talk later?

Magic’s surprised. Even touched a little bit and --

A FEW SECONDS LATER

He picks up the phone, trying to put on a smile.

                    MAGIC
          Hey Larry, what’s cooking?

                    LARRY
          Magic, man, I’m so sorry. Just tell
          me what I can do.

                    MAGIC
          You don’t have to do anything. It’s
          all going to be fine. We just got
          Cookie tested. She’s healthy so
          there’s really no worry. What I
          want to know is how you feeling,
          Larry? Seen you wearing that
          corset. You look like an old man.

                    LARRY
          Yeah, I feel like one too.

In spite of the circumstances, Larry and Magic both laugh.
But then they fall into silence. Larry’s getting choked up.

                    LARRY (CONT’D)
          You don’t quit on me, Earvin.

                    MAGIC
          Don’t have much of a choice. Docs
          say I gotta retire --

                    LARRY
          I’m not talking about that. Just
          don’t quit on me, got it?

Magic understands Larry’s fear.

                    MAGIC
          I gotta run. Thanks for calling.
          But don’t you worry. I don’t quit.
                                                       123.


Magic hangs up, quite moved, as we end on:

Larry, setting down the receiver. Dinah waits for the news.

                    LARRY
          You believe this guy? He’s trying
          to cheer me up.

                    DINAH
          Maybe it means he can beat it.

                    LARRY
          You heard of someone who has?

Dinah’s got no response and Larry’s clearly terrified as --


INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

Magic, in his suit, rides with Cookie to the Forum. They may
as well be in a hearse. Magic’s understandably heavy as --

Like many years before, L.A.’s sights shine out the window.
Magic views them, nostalgic, passing a bright row of ORANGE
TREES on a Beverly Hills Lawn. He considers them, sadly. His
beginning. Now his end as --


INT. FORUM - NIGHT

Cookie waits alone in a hallway outside the locker room in
her “optimistic” white suit. Putting on a brave face as --

The LAKERS all file out -- having just heard the news. Grown
men just in tears who can’t meet Cookie’s eyes.

She waits for the long, funeral procession to end until
Earvin finally appears in the door. Cookie takes him by the
hand and they now make their way to --


INT. FORUM CLUB - NIGHT

The holy of holies. Magic enters the club, not for a party,
but a press conference. The famously private, no cameras
allowed, club is now jammed with REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS
and NBA ROYALTY while --


INT. LARRY BIRD'S BROOKLINE HOME - SAME

Larry and Dinah watch on TV as Magic takes his place at the
podium. Cookie’s beside him. Dr. Buss, weeping openly.
                                                       124.


DAVID STERN, JERRY WEST, DR. Mellman, Coop and Kareem take
seats on both sides. It looks like The Last Supper.

Magic waits at the mic. A long beat of silence. Putting on a
big smile as the cameras keep flashing. Finally --

                    MAGIC (ON TV)
          “First of all, let me say good
          after -- good after late afternoon.
          Because of the uh -- the HIV virus
          that I have attained, I will have
          to retire from the Lakers today.”

The words take Larry’s wind and --


INT. FORUM CLUB - SAME

Magic adjusts the mic as the news hits the room.

                    MAGIC
          “I just want to make clear, first
          of all, that I do not have the AIDS
          disease -- 'cause I know a lot of
          you are -- want to know that -- but
          the HIV virus. My wife is fine.
          She's negative, so there's no
          problem with her. I plan on going
          on, living for a long time, bugging
          you guys, like I've have so --
          you'll see me around. Obviously,
          I'm going to miss playing, but I
          will now become a spokesman for the
          HIV virus because I want people --
          young people to realize that they
          can practice safe sex. And you know
          sometimes you're a little naive
          about it and you think it could
          never happen to you. You only
          thought it could happen to, you
          know, other people and so on and
          all but... I'm going to deal with
          it and my life will go on. And I
          will be here, enjoying the Laker
          games, and all the other NBA games
          around the country. So, life is
          going to go on for me, and I'm
          going to be a happy man.”

The effort to hope is gut-wrenching. The room is dead silent.
                                                        125.


                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          “I want to thank everybody up here,
          as well as my teammates, because
          they've been behind me all the way.
          I want to thank Kareem for coming
          out, him and "Coop" who -- who
          stood side by side and won a lot of
          battles. I want to thank also Jerry
          West for all he's done. Dr. Kerr.
          Dr. Mellman -- he will tell you who
          my other doctors are that have
          helped me through this -- as well
          as, like I said, my father, in a
          sense, Dr. Jerry Buss, for just
          drafting me and me being here.”

Dr. Buss almost faints. Cookie gives him a hand.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          “Now, of course, I will miss the
          battles and the wars, and I will
          miss you guys. But life goes on...
          This is not like my life is over,
          cause it’s not. I’m gonna live on.
          This is another challenge. It’s
          another chapter in my life. It’s
          like being -- like your back’s
          against the wall but I think you
          just have to come out swinging. And
          I’m swinging so -- I am going to go
          on. I’m gonna beat it so uhm, thank
          you again. And I’ll see you soon.”

And with that, while reporters bomb questions, Magic hands
over the mic, stepping away from the podium as --


INT. LARRY BIRD'S BROOKLINE HOME - SAME

Larry watches through tears the unbelievable -- and here
before never seen -- sight of Magic vacating the stage though
a black curtain behind it. Walking away from the spotlight.

Larry watches, just gutted. He can’t even move and --


INT. BOSTON GARDEN - (THE VERY NEXT) NIGHT

Before a game against the HAWKS, Larry’s still overcome. He
stands for the ANTHEM, unable to contain his emotions and --

For just the second time in his life, Larry does not want to
play ball. We see this during the game as --

A FEW MINUTES LATER

Larry runs on the court, but he plays in a fog. No passion.
No love. Like he’s underwater and can’t come up for air, but -

In one moment of grace, with back broken and all, Larry
pushes the ball on the break, approaching mid court when --

From out of nowhere, he throws a fifty foot, behind the back
dime to a streaking REGGIE LEWIS who throws it down a dunk
and for a moment we --

in style, throwing the same behind the back dime as we --

                                                 CUT BACK TO:

LARRY, hobbling back on defense, understanding this was a
tribute to Magic. It’s incredibly painful and --


EXT. LOCKER ROOM, BOSTON GARDEN - AFTER THE GAME

Larry (in a bad Cosby sweater) is mobbed by reporters at his
locker. He is very subdued.

                      MUSBERGER
          How did   you feel out there, Larry?
          We know   how your back’s been, but
          tonight   it seem like you were
          playing   with heavy heart?

                    LARRY
          “No doubt about it. I was. Probably
          the two toughest days I’ve had
          since my father passed away and --
          I’ve been very depressed and sort
          of been out of it. You know, just
          out of the blue, something like
          that happening, it’s just -- I’ve
          never, other than one other
          instance, and I was hoping I’d
          never see that again cause I
          remember how I felt, weeks after
          that and yesterday was just a -- a
          sad day.”

We linger on Larry, trying to hold in his pain, but for once,
he’s unable to and --

INT. LARRY BIRD'S BROOKLINE BOSTON HOME - NIGHT

When he gets home to Dinah, he goes immediately for a beer.

                     LARRY
          All these years, me and him, we’ve
          been linked. It’s like I knew he
          was out there -- working hard,
          getting better. I had to get better
          too. But if Magic ain’t there --
              (beat)
          This competition is just --

                    DINAH
          It’s not all about competition.
          He’s your friend and you’re scared.

Larry sits downs. Still fighting.

                    LARRY
          After my dad died, I put it all
          into winning - but every time,
          there was Magic. I figured I could
          beat him then, I could maybe move
          on, put all that in the past but --
          if he’s not there anymore, I don’t
          know how to do it.

                    DINAH
          Maybe you don’t have to fight him.
          Maybe you just let him in. Just be
          there as a friend.

                    LARRY
          And what about if he’s gone?

Dinah puts her hand on his back as Larry Bird finally cries.

                    DAMON WAYANS (PRELAP)
          No, I love living in L.A. It’s the
          best place in the world.


INT. COMEDY STORE - NIGHT

Trying to enjoy a night out, Magic sits with Cookie VIP at
the comedy club, watching DAMON WAYANS performing on stage.

                    WAYANS
          Basketball season is back. They say
          Magic might come back to help out
          the Lakers. That’d be nice right?

Magic smiles. Cookie tenses. Damon doesn’t know they’re here.
                                                         128.


                    WAYANS (CONT’D)
          You know what Magic stands for
          don’t you? “My - Ass - Got -
          Infected - Coach.”

On Magic. Trying to laugh the joke off. It gets worse.

                    WAYANS (CONT’D)
          I wonder if a lot of the players
          don’t wanna play with Magic now.
          He’s all sweaty and shit, they
          gotta body him up in fucking Hazmat
          suits and shit. Be like --
              (let’s a player drive by)
          Oop, damn. Couldn’t get that Magic.
          Right by me, man. Damn. Hey coach,
          that’s Magic. I can’t check Magic.

The crowd laughs. Cookie can see Magic’s hurt. She tries to
get him to leave, but Magic won’t move. He endures it.

                    WAYANS (CONT’D)
          You see the All Star game. The only
          person in the league wanna d-Magic
          up is Dennis Rodman and he’s up on
          his ass like --
              (bodies him up hard)
          Boom! Knocks him to the ground. Be
          like “Look? I’m not scared of
          Magic. I’m fucking everybody. I
          don’t know what the fuck I got.
          Y’all oughta be scared of me!

The crowd is in stitches. Cookie fights tears. Magic puts on
a good face, but he’s cut to the bone and --


INT. MAGIC'S BEL AIR MANSION - DAY

The next day, Cookie’s surprised when she comes into the
bedroom to find Magic lacing his sneakers.

                    COOKIE
          Where you going?

                    MAGIC
          To the gym. Wanna say hey to the
          guys. Shoot around for a bit. I’ll
          take it easy. Don’t worry.

That’s not Cookie’s concern. He kisses her as he goes and --
                                                       129.


EXT. FORUM - DAY

Just like the old times, A MARQUEE ANNOUNCES TONIGHT’S GAME:
LAKERS VS. PISTONS.

FANS wait at the players’ gate clamoring for autographs when
Magic steps out of his Mercedes, thrilled to be back in his
element. He puts on a big smile, ready to greet all his fans -

But, to Magic’s dismay, the crowd parts when he enters. They
don’t beg for his autographs or clamor for pictures. They
back away like he’s toxic and won’t meet his eyes.

Magic heads through them, destroyed and --


INT. FORUM - DAY

-- when he enters his old home, saying HI to the PRESS,
giving high fives to the STAFF, this time, the mood’s grave.

A REPORTER reluctantly takes a high-five. Then wipes his hand
on his pants as Magic passes along. It’s devastating to see.

A dead man walking.


INT. COURT, FORUM - MOMENTS LATER

It’s even worse on the court. Magic’s former teammates warm-
up in the empty arena when Magic, in practice gear, steps
onto the court. The record scratches. A long beat.

                    COACH DUNLEAVY
          How’s it going there, Magic?

                    MAGIC
          Yeah, it’s going real good. Just
          wanted come and work out. See if
          you needed a hand. I could pretend
          to be Isaiah.

Magic does an Isaiah impersonation. A few awkward laughs. But
he doesn’t get any takers.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          Hey James, how about you? Wanna run
          one-on-one?

                    JAMES WORTHY
          Uh -- maybe later. That cool? I
          wanna work on my free throws.
                                                       130.


                    MAGIC
          Ok. Go ahead. A.C. How bout you?

                    A.C.
          Just about to go get taped up.

                    MAGIC
          OK. Cool. Anybody wants a game,
          I’ll be right over here. ‘Less
          y’all just don’t wanna get beat.

Magic, keeping his head high, dribbles to another basket and
begins hoisting up shots. The few players there take their
balls and move to another rim, leaving Magic alone.

It’s a very sad sight, but Magic tries to shoot through it.
Finally, Bryon Scott comes over, shaking his head in
disappointment with his teammates’ behavior.

                    BYRON SCOTT
          You want someone to rebound?

                    MAGIC
              (appreciating the gesture)
          What’s going on with the guys?

                    BYRON SCOTT
          Man, they’re just scared. A lot of
          the guys, they don’t know what to
          say. And a lot of the others, just
          afraid that they’ll catch it.

                    MAGIC
          You know it don’t work like that
          right?

                    BYRON SCOTT
          Of course man, I know. But half of
          ‘em just went out and got tested
          themselves. They’ll come around.
          Give ‘em time. They just don’t want
          to die.
              (beat. He feels terrible)
          Man, that’s not what I meant.

                    MAGIC
          I’m not going to die. I feel fine.

Byron wants to believe that, but it sounds like blind hope.

                    BYRON SCOTT
          Just give the brothers some time.
          It’s a lot to take in. Plus, with
          what Isiah’s being say --
                                                          131.


                    MAGIC
          What do you mean? What’d he say?

                    BYRON SCOTT
          Oh shit. You haven’t heard?

Off Magic, he hasn’t. But he’s about to find out and --


INT. VISITOR'S LOCKER ROOM - FORUM - LATER

Isaiah Thomas is buttoning up his warm-ups, joking around
with his teammates as they exit the tunnel when Magic
appears. Still wearing in his warm-ups.

                    ISAIAH
          Hey Magic. Uh-oh. You making
          comeback already?

                    MAGIC
          You been calling my agent?

                    ISAIAH
          I been calling who what?

                    MAGIC
          You call Lou Rosen, I said? Say you
          heard I was gay?

                    ISAIAH
          Did I what? Are you crazy? C’mon. I
          got a game.

He tries laughing this off, but Magic won’t let it pass.

                    MAGIC
          I heard you been going around,
          asking what’s going on. You saying,
          that isn’t true?

Isaiah finally stops, caught. He lets down his pretense.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          What the fuck, bro? I thought we
          were boys. You know me better than
          anyone. We vacation together. You
          had a key to my house.

                    ISAIAH
          I don’t know what you   do out here
          in Hollywood when I’m   not around.
          You out with Dr. Buss   and Arsenio.
          I don’t know what you   get into.
                                                       132.


                    MAGIC
          You really think that I’m gay?
              (Isaiah is silent)
          Your friend gets this news and
          that’s where you go first? Not, is
          he ok? Not, let me call Earvin? No.
          Instead you go around, telling the
          world that I’m gay.
              (Isaiah doesn’t deny it)
          You’re only worried about you. You
          afraid what they’ll say cause we
          used to kiss before games.

Isaiah doesn’t deny it. He shows no emotion.

                     ISAIAH
          I didn’t live your life, Magic.
          Whatever you did, whoever you did
          it with, guess you gotta live with
          it now. I’m sorry. I am.
              (beat)
          I gotta run. Got a game. You give
          my love to Cookie.

                    MAGIC
          Hope you break a leg asshole.

                    ISAIAH
          You reap what you sew.

Isaiah walks off with smirk, leaving Magic in the tunnel.
Backstage and alone. Listening the roar of the crowd. The
spotlight shinning without him and --


INT. MAGIC'S BEL AIR MANSION - LATER THAT NIGHT

Magic’s awake in the dark, watching a VHS on his TV.

The tape’s of a game he’s returned to many times in his life.
1980. Game 6. The NBA Finals when a 20 year-old Magic played
the game of his life and cemented his stardom.

Magic watches, bittersweet. 40 points. 15 boards. 7 assists.
Twelve years ago. Much as changed since then. But what has
not is Magic’s drive to win. To excel. To survive. We see it
in his face and --

                    MARK BIRD (PRELAP)
          He really asked you to come?

EXT. LAKE, FRENCH LICK - DAY

Larry is fishing on a boat with Mark. It’s peaceful, but a
tough gig for Larry, still wearing the fucking BACK-BRACE.

                    MARK BIRD
          Can you fly with your back?

                    LARRY
          I’ll be sitting on a plane. I don’t
          have flap there myself.

                    MARK BIRD
          Way you’re fishing, might need to.
          You couldn’t catch a flight.

                    LARRY
          Ain’t seen you catch anything
          either.

                    MARK BIRD
          Didn’t wanna make you feel bad.
          Just wait, cause it’s coming.

They could do this all day. Two brothers, talking shit.

                    MARK BIRD (CONT’D)
          Well I’m proud that you’re going.
          Sure it means a lot. Not a lot of
          people in his corner right now.

                    LARRY
          I know he’d do it for me.

                    MARK BIRD
          Bet he would. They ever retire your
          jersey, they’ll have to hang that
          thing too. It did half the work.

He’s talking about the back brace.

                    LARRY
          When I’m done this, I’m gonna blow
          it half. Can’t run anymore, but I
          can still fucking shoot.

Larry mimes a shotgun. Off the Bird brothers’ laugh...


EXT. FORUM - NIGHT (ESTABLISHING)

Another sparkling night. Showtime in L.A. where --
                                                       134.


INT. FORUM - THAT MOMENT

Larry (in a suit) walks through the now familiar tunnels,
catching some heckles from the good natured staff.

                    STAFF
          Hey Larry, Boston sucks!

                    LARRY
          You guys aren’t real good either.

The staff laughs. So does Larry. Dr. Buss warmly approaches.

                    DR. BUSS
          Thanks for coming. Means the world.
          Know it’s hard to travel right now.

                    LARRY
          That’s all right. Wouldn’t miss it.

                    DR. BUSS
          Well, come on. Earvin’s waiting.
          Wanted to talk with you before.

Dr. Buss doesn’t say about what. Just leads Larry off into --


INT. FORUM CLUB - NIGHT

The once raucous club. Now eerily silent. Larry enters to see
Magic sitting alone in a booth in a chocolate brown suit. The
two men take a moment, both clearly torn up.

                    MAGIC
          Thanks for coming.

                    LARRY
          Are you kidding? Get to see you
          retire? I’ve been waiting 12 years.
          Wish I was playing tonight. Think
          I’d probably drop sixty.

                    MAGIC
          Yeah. Bet you could. Bet you would.

Magic gets up and they hug. A long time. Emotional.

                    LARRY
          Don’t get all sentimental on me.
          You still look pretty good too.
          Could probably get twenty at least.
                                                       135.


                    MAGIC
          You really think? Well, that’s
          good. Cause that’s actually what I
          wanted to talk to you about.

Larry drops the embrace, wary of Magic’s sly smile and --

A FEW MINUTES LATER

They are sitting in the booth. Magic’s laid out his plan.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          You gotta come, Larry. I need this.
          Michael’s going to play. I talked
          to Charles and Patrick.

                    LARRY
          Didn’t talk to Laimbeer, did you?
          I’d hate to see him on the bus,
          saying “Hi Larry,” and me have to
          say, “Fuck you, Bill.”

Magic laughs.

                    MAGIC
          It’s called The Dream Team, Larry.
          It’s the greatest team ever. We
          didn’t call Bill Laimbeer. We need
          you, Larry Bird.

                    LARRY
          Earvin, my back is so broke, I can
          hardly get out of bed. I can’t run
          with you guys.

                     MAGIC
          I don’t need you to run. I need you
          there as a friend.
              (beat)
          I need to prove I still got it. But
          I can’t do it without you. With no
          Bird, there’s no Magic.

Larry is silent. And moved. He takes a long beat.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          If it makes a difference, I’ll ask,
          but I don’t think they’ll move the
          Olympics to French Lick.

                    LARRY
          Is Isaiah gonna be there?

Magic shakes his head, gleefully.
                                                       136.


                    MAGIC
          You reap what you sew.
              (enjoys that for a beat)
          So what’s it going to be, Larry?
          You ready to be on my team?

Off Larry, regarding his friend as --

                    CHUCK HEARN (PRELAP)
          Our next speaker has been linked
          with Magic Johnson ever since they
          met in the NCAA Tournament
          Championship back in 1979 --


INT. FORUM - A FEW HOURS LATER

The arena is dark. Magic stands on the court in the beam of a
spotlight for a very somber ceremony. A funeral with the
deceased in attendance. Chuck Hearn’s at the podium.

                    CHUCK HEARN
          Their spirited rivalry peaked of
          course in their three meetings in
          the NBA finals.

Reveal Larry, sitting on the Lakers court, waiting to rise --

                    CHUCK HEARN (CONT’D)
          Representing the Boston Celtics. A
          guy who came out here under great
          duress. 12 hours in an airplane
          with a bad back is not fun. Please
          join me in giving a tremendous Los
          Angeles welcome to Larry Bird.

Larry rises as the Lakers fans, in a moment of tremendous
class -- give him a long standing ovation. Larry’s touched.

                    LARRY
          Thank you. Thank you.
              (the applause keeps going)
          Hey, come on. Thanks a lot but I’m
          not the one retiring here.

                    SCREAMING LAKERS FAN (O.S.)
          WHEN ARE YOU?

                       LARRY
          Very soon.

The crowd laughs. Larry regroups, reading a prepared speech.
                                                       137.


                    LARRY (CONT’D)
          Earvin “Magic” Johnson. The respect
          you have earned through out the NBA
          for your outstanding and unique
          play was never more evident than
          between the intense rivalry between
          the Lakers and The Celtics.
              (Larry holds a gift)
          This piece of Boston Garden Parquet
          symbolizes your place in the hearts
          and minds of Celtics fans
          everywhere. You never wore the
          green and white, but you’ll always
          be a part of our family. Magic...

Larry hands Magic the commemorative gift and the two rivals
hug. And outside of the reach of the microphones --

                     MAGIC
              (whispers)
          Thank you.

Larry’s moved so he takes the mic back, returns to the crowd.

                    LARRY
          And he’s not done yet because we’re
          going to go to Barcelona and bring
          back the gold for everyone here in
          the United States.

That brings the crowd to their feet and a smile to Magic. The
friends shake hands. United. Applause washes over them as --

A MUSIC CUE STARTS, taking us through --


A VICTORY LAP OF A MONTAGE: THE DREAM TEAM

For the first time in 14 years, Larry and Magic are on the
same team. They sit next to each other on the bus, taking in
the historic sights of Barcelona.

- They take pictures with FANS in TOURIST SIGHTS in the city.

- They practice together in their USA JERSEYS along with
Jordan and Ewing. Clyde and Malone. Magic running the show.
Larry (and his broken back) shooting threes on the sidelines.

- They laugh side by side at the dias during pressers and
goof in the locker-room, looking at Larry’s mangled fingers,
still crooked from the bar fight.

- They drink beers, talking shit, smoking cigars, betting
games of pool in the hotel with Jordan and of course...

- At the games, they sit side by side on the bench. No longer
eager young studs waiting for their chance to compete, but
basketball legends here for the love of the game and --

- On the court, Magic shows the world that he still has the
goods. On a flashy fast break, Magic jukes a CANADIAN PLAYER
out of his jock, dancing in for a lay-up and --

- While Larry’s back keep him laying down on the sidelines
during most of the games, he talks shit while he does it,
cracking up Magic, Jordan, and Ewing until finally --

- CHUCK DALEY (the Coach) signals Larry into the game. He
peels himself off the floor. Checking in next to Magic.

                    MAGIC
          Wanna show these fools something?

Larry laughs at the call back and when they get in the game,
Magic seeks Larry out, trying to get him his shots.

                    MAGIC (CONT’D)
          Larry!

Magic feeds him for a three, which Larry buries and...

- One another possession, Magic drives down the lane, dishing
over his shoulder to Larry at the wing for a three that he
nails and the teammates high five and for a moment we --

break. Magic dropping a no-look dime over his shoulder to
Larry, who dishes it no-look back to Magic for a wide open
lay-up and the young bucks high five and we --

                                                CUT BACK TO:

THE GAME IN BARCELONA. As before. Old Magic and Larry jogging
back on D. Slapping five. Teammates as we END MONTAGE AT:


INT. BARCELONA LOCKER ROOM - DAY

The game’s complete. Larry and Magic hang their jerseys,
dressing in street clothes. Larry’s a little nostalgic.

                    MAGIC
          So is this really it?

                    LARRY
          Oh yeah. This is it. How ‘bout you?
          You look sharp.
                                                        139.


                    MAGIC
          Yeah. I feel pretty good. Still got
          a some gas in the tank. Maybe I’ll
          run it all back. Can’t let Michael
          have all the fun.

                    LARRY
          Who the hell’s out here for fun?

They laugh. Larry grabs Magic’s jersey. Hands him a marker.

                    LARRY (CONT’D)
          Wanna sign this thing for me?

                    MAGIC
          You gonna sign one for me?

Larry signs his. The two old rivals exchange jerseys and --


INT. BARCELONA ARENA - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Larry and Magic step off the elevator, heading toward the
lobby to exit the arena.

In the distance, they can see a CROWD OF FANS and REPORTERS
outside by the TEAM BUS, waiting for a glimpse of the stars.

Larry slows up. Starts to turn.

                    LARRY
          You know, I talked to this guy.
          There’s a side door over here. You
          don’t have to mess with all that.
          We can slip out the back.

Magic gives him a smile.

                    MAGIC
          Thought I told you before. I don’t
          go out the side door.

Some things never change. He and Larry slap hands. A final
goodbye. And then Larry is gone, disappearing out a quiet
backdoor. Into the sunset, alone as --

Magic watches him go, grateful and moved, before he turns to
the entrance, lights up his bright smile, and steps through
the doors into the arms of his fans as we --

                                             FADE TO BLACK.
