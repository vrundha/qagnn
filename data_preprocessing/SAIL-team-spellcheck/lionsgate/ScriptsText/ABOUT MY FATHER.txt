EXT. REMOTE VIRGINIA AIRPORT - DAY

A small prop plane taxis toward the runway. It’s a serene
scene, with a beautiful mountainous backdrop, until...

SEBASTIAN bursts from the airport, sprinting to the plane.
Two overweight TSA OFFICERS chase after him, calling out:

                     TSA OFFICER
           Sir, stop! You can’t be out here!

                     SEBASTIAN
           All due respect, Officer Man Boobs!
           But I gotta stop that plane!

As they lumber after him, we hear Sebastian in Voice Over...

                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
           At this point, you’re probably
           asking two questions: One, “don't
           the guys in charge of protecting
           our airports from terrorists have
           to pass some sort of physical?”

The TSA Officers double over with cramps. One starts to dry
heave as Sebastian races ahead, heading off the plane.

                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
           And more importantly, “did we
           really just drop a bunch of cash to
           watch some typical American run-to-
           the-airport rom-com?” Well you can
           relax ‘cause the answer is no.

                     SEBASTIAN
           Stop the plane! Please! I need to
           tell you something!

The plane grinds to a halt. The door opens and lowers to the
ground, but before we see who’s getting off, we hear...

                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
           So put your damn Instagram away, go
           light on the popcorn crunch and just
           sit back and enjoy the ride. ‘Cause
           while this is a love story, I
           promise it’s anything but typical.

Sinatra music swells, as we see the following traditional
Italian menu course appear on a title card over black...
              2.




“APERITIVO”

FADE IN:

We lift high out of this airport scene into “Google Earth”
imagery, as Sebastian begins his tale...

                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
           Like most American stories, my
           family’s started a long time ago on
           another continent... specifically,
           the magical island of Sicilia.

We cross the Atlantic, then push in toward the map of Italy.

                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
           Lot of folks like to call Sicily
           the big ball in front of the boot
           of Italy, which makes sense ‘cause
           the world’s been trying to kick our
           ass since the dawn of time.

We show footage of the following real life catastrophes...

                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
           For generations, our people have
           been threatened by wars, volcanoes,
           testicle-crushing Speedos...

...ending with slo-mo close-ups of Italian men’s beachwear.

                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.)(CONT’D)
           But we’ve survived it all through
           with one unstoppable force: FAMILY.

We show actual video footage of Sebastian’s family eating...

                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
           This is actual footage of my Sicilian
           ancestors. All those clothes? Hand-
           stitched by my great-grandmother. And
           that food on the table? Harvested
           from a garden planted by my great-
           grandfather.

An NFL-style telestrator circles Sebastian’s grandfather.

                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
           Note the signature Maniscalco look,
           with the curved spines and the
           resting bitch face -- like a bunch
           of pissed off candy canes.

We see a long sequence of Maniscalco men, family-tree-style.
                                                            4.


                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          For centuries, the hunchbacked men
          in my family have operated with one
          goal: Do everything you can to give
          your family a better life than you
          had. Now this doesn’t mean spoiling
          ‘em like the kids I see today
          slapping their parents in the neck
          so they can play more Fortnite...

We see iPhone footage of U.S. kids throwing tantrums.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          It means working your ass off to
          provide, while also giving them
          love, and tough life lessons so
          that they grow up to be good people
          who never embarrass themselves.

We start to flip through photos, family-album-style, starting
with these actual pictures of Sebastian’s family in the ‘80s.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          For my father, this meant leaving
          his beloved Sicily for Chicago so
          he and my mother could give me
          opportunities he never got... like
          learning how to dance like Michael
          Jackson... growing a mullet... and
          blowing three hundred bucks on
          professional glamour photos...

As we sift through several pages of ACTUAL sexy shots...

                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          My mother was right -- screw all
          those modeling agencies that never
          called me back -- I’m beautiful.
              (then)
          So while my modeling career failed
          to materialize, my father busted
          his literal hump to support us and
          to instill in me certain rules of
          how a man should live his life...
          Like, always look people in their
          eyes when you’re talking to them...


INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - QUICK POP

YOUNG SEBASTIAN makes intense eye contact with the OWNER.
                                                           5.


                    YOUNG SEBASTIAN
          Good morning, Mr. Mascarella. My
          father would like another pack of
          your finest Jewel Cigars.

                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          If you’re awake, you should be
          working...


INT. SEBASTIAN’S CHILDHOOD HOME - QUICK POP

YOUNG SEBASTIAN, eats cereal and watches cartoons when YOUNG
SALVO (30s, slick, pony-tailed, with an accent that’s half-
Sicilian, half-condescending) enters and shuts off the TV.

                    YOUNG SALVO
          If you’re old enough to turn on a
          TV, you’re old enough to fill out a
          job application!

As Young Salvo marches off, Young Sebastian calls after:

                    YOUNG SEBASTIAN
          But Dad, I’m only eight!

                    YOUNG SALVO
          Hey, look who can count! Maybe you
          should be a bookie!

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Always be resourceful...


EXT. SEBASTIAN’S CHILDHOOD HOME - QUICK POP

Young Sebastian shows a picture of a super cute dog to Young
Salvo, who shakes his head, not having it.

                    YOUNG SALVO
          For the last time, we’re not
          getting a damn dog! You wanna pet
          an animal? Go three houses down; I
          think they got a ferret!

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          And save your money...


INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - QUICK POP

Young Sebastian looks over a menu. Young Salvo leans over and
uses his hands to block the top and bottom portions.
                                                            6.


                    YOUNG SALVO
          No apps, no dessert, and if you
          don’t finish your main, I’m taking
          it out of your lawn mowing money.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          ...wherever you can...


INT. SEBASTIAN'S CHILDHOOD HOME -- CHRISTMAS MORNING

Young Sebastian opens a present and stares warily at a small
rolling pallet with some 2x4’s nailed on top.

                    YOUNG SALVO
          You wanna me to buy you a skate
          board? I build you one instead!

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Except on your signature scent...


INT. SEBASTIAN'S CHILDHOOD HOME -- QUICK POP

Young Salvo and Young Sebastian spray fancy colognes into the
air, then close their eyes and POP THEIR BODIES DRAMATICALLY
through the mist. Sebastian’s ADORING MOM claps for her men.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          As a boy, I looked up to this man
          like he was a God...


EXT. SEBASTIAN'S CHILDHOOD HOME - WINTER - QUICK POP

Young Sebastian struggles to skate up to the house on his
shit wooden skateboard. He finds Young Salvo aggressively
shoveling snow from a snow bank back onto their driveway.

                    YOUNG SEBASTIAN
          Dad, aren’t you supposed to shovel
          the snow off the driveway?!

                    YOUNG SALVO
          I pay the man five hundred to clear
          our drive for the whole winter, but
          it’s barely snowed. So I’m gonna
          get my damn money’s worth!

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          And for forty years, I lived my
          life by his immigrant gospel.
                                                         7.


Convinced, Young Sebastian grabs a shovel to help and looks
up at his father, adoringly.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          And it was all working out perfect,
          until I grew up and fell for someone
          who was my complete opposite...


INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - MODERN DAY - EVENING

SEBASTIAN settles in with his dream girl, ELLIE (30s,
relaxed, radiant, blessed with the charm to constantly mess
with people yet still have a 5.0 UBER passenger rating).

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          A cool and confident girl whose
          parents were so supportive, they
          let her be an artist. Imagine that.
              (in love)
          And her name... was Ellie.

                    ELLIE
          Wait, you parked nine blocks away?
          That’s crazy. And clearly a lie.
              (feels his forehead)
          You sweat just getting the mail.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Soon as I read that the valet cost
          fifteen bucks, I put on the merino.
              (fun, sexy)
          It’s all wicking away.

Ellie laughs and they kiss. She starts tossing olives in the
air, catching them in her mouth, and spitting out the pits
onto a plate. Sebastian stares at her with stars in his eyes.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          I mean, look at this girl –- the
          good pedigree, the positivity, the
          blatant disregard for basic
          manners... she’s everything my
          father raised me not to be... and I
          couldn’t be more in love with her.

                    ELLIE
          Well while you were finding a space
          pretty much back in our driveway, I
          ordered up a bunch of random apps.

Ellie grabs some bread and reaches for the butter.
                                                            8.


                    SEBASTIAN
          Whoa, whoa, whoa...

Sebastian pulls out a special flask from his blazer.

                    ELLIE
          Annnd of course you brought your
          own olive oil. Does it really make
          that much of a difference?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Does it make a-- Ellie! This stuff
          is the real deal, pressed, by hand,
          on my great grandfather’s farm.
              (dramatically acting out)
          If you close your eyes, you can
          taste the soil from the Sicilian
          fingers that plucked these olives
          from the trees.

He does this and encourages Ellie, who does the same.

                    ELLIE
          Holy crap, I totally can!
              (kinda grossed out)
          Which is why I asked our waiter for
          hand-churned Irish butter.

Sebastian isn’t sure, but Ellie forces him to try it.

                    ELLIE (CONT’D)
          Come on. I won’t tell your dad.

Sebastian reluctantly tries it, but it’s clearly amazing.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Wow.

                    ELLIE
          Right?

                    SEBASTIAN
          This is unbelievable.
              (grabbing the butter)
          Screw the bread. I’m gonna take
          this thing down like a popsicle.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          She’s amazing. And since the day I
          met her, Ellie’s been opening my
          eyes to all kinds of amazing
          experiences. Like “Lazy Sundays”...
                                                         9.


INT. SEBASTIAN AND ELLIE'S TOWNHOUSE - QUICK POP

Ellie is snuggled up in bed, as we reveal Sebastian next to
her, fully dressed and ready to start his day.

                    SEBASTIAN
          So we just... “go back to sleep”?

                    ELLIE
          That’s right.

                    SEBASTIAN
          But when do we get up?

                    ELLIE
          Whenever we want.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Huh. This is incredible.

Sebastian lays back down in bed, trying to enjoy it. Then:

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          I’m gonna set my alarm for six just
          in case.

As Sebastian reaches for his clock, we see it’s only 5:43.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          And beauty treatments...


INT. SEBASTIAN AND ELLIE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

Ellie watches TV, in a green mud mask. Sebastian exits the
bathroom, wearing a similar mask, looking super angry.

                    ELLIE
          Hey, looking good, babe! Wait, are
          you pissed off?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Yeah. That it took me forty-two
          years to discover avocado masks.
              (super into it)
          My pores have never felt tighter.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          And a melange of tight-shorted
          games she calls “racket sports”...
                                                        10.


INT. INDOOR TENNIS COURTS - DAY

A TENNIS PRO feeds balls to Ellie and Sebastian, who are
dressed in all whites. Ellie hits first, grunting loudly like
Maria Sharapova. Then Sebastian hits, grunting the same way.

                    SEBASTIAN
          And last but not least: smiling.


INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - BACK TO PRESENT

Sebastian looks at Ellie and awkwardly tries his best smile.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Man, this is what life’s all about,
          huh? I’ve got the delicious food,
          the incredible girlfriend, and--

A fun Australian, BRETT, stands up, dinging his glass. He’s
surrounded by people ready to dance and holding signs.

                    BRETT (O.S.)
          Hiya guys! My soon-to-be-fiancé
          Derick will be here any sec, so can
          everyone please take your places?!

                    SEBASTIAN
              (disgusted)
          --your art school pal forcing us to
          be a part of his flash mob proposal.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Life with Ellie was pretty much
          perfect. But I couldn’t ever stop
          feeling like my father was there,
          watching and judging me.

Everyone cheers as Brett and his friends get set to perform.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Ellie, I’m sorry. I don’t think I
          can be a participate in this.

                    ELLIE
          Come on, Sebastian! You promised.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I know. You’re right. I did.
              (can’t help himself)
          But look at your friends! Dancing
          around this nice restaurant like
          we’re in the cafeteria from
          Grease?! It’s embarrassing!
                                                        11.


Ellie watches Brett and his friends doing a choreographed
dance for a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN, who has entered.

                    ELLIE
          I think it’s sweet that they want
          to show their love like this.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Of course it’s sweet! But it’s way
          too early in a relationship to set
          the bar this high! I mean what are
          they even celebrating? Two years of
          great sex, a few vacations, and
          successfully syncing their Netflix
          queues? I mean, you gotta build up to
          a gesture this big. Like, you should
          only qualify for a grand gesture
          after you’ve survived fifty years of
          mortgage fights and raised four
          bratty kids who disappoint you, but
          you’re still somehow managing to mash
          your saggy old privates together like
          two heavyweight boxers!

                    ELLIE
          And I no longer want this burrata.

                    SEBASTIAN
          All this? It’s just a celebration of
          having too much time on your hands!
              (then, lower)
          Trust me, when I propose to you,
          it’s gonna be intimate, just us. No
          one else. The way it should be.

Ellie breaks into a smile, directed at Sebastian.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          What? What’s that look mean?

                    ELLIE
          You just said “When I propose.” It
          used to be “If”. Now it’s when.

                    SEBASTIAN
              (caught)
          I’m aggravated. Words are flying
          out of my mouth. Now can we please
          get out of here?

                    BRETT
          Uh Ellie, what’s happening? I kinda
          can’t do this without you two.
                                                        12.


He points to some dancers, who hold signs that spell out:
“M-A-R-R-Y M-E D-I-C-K”. Ellie turns back to Sebastian.

                    ELLIE
          I love being alone with you too.
          But we promised we’d help my best
          friend, so you better ignore that
          angry Dad voice in your head and
          get your ass up and dance with me.

                    SEBASTIAN
          El. You know I don’t like dancing.

                    ELLIE
          Pfft. That’s such a lie.

                    SEBASTIAN
          You’re right. I love it.

As Sebastian breaks, Ellie lights up -- so pleased this guy
will do anything for her. She pulls out two cardboard signs
and hands one to Sebastian. They fall into the routine with
an “E” and an “R”, turning the “D-I-C-K” into “D-E-R-I-C-K”.

Brett’s fiancé lights up and says an emphatic yes! And as
confetti blasts out, Ellie laughs and kisses Sebastian.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          So, clearly I was conflicted. But
          while my father represented my
          past, this gorgeous girl was my
          future. And now I just needed to
          find the right time and place to
          make that transition official...

As Sebastian and Ellie keep dancing, cracking each other up,
the Sinatra music fades back up as we fade back out into the
next part of the journey...

INT. SEBASTIAN AND ELLIE’S TOWNHOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

Sebastian drinks coffee at the living room window, mocking a
hipster with a topknot who walks his dog out front.

                    SEBASTIAN
          His name is Bruce and he’s a
          rescue? But really, he’s the one
          who rescued us.

The dog drops a deuce on the lawn. The owner looks around and
goes to leave, but Sebastian bangs on the glass.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          Yo! Guy! Pick that up or I’m gonna
          follow you home and stuff it into
          your vape pen! Thank youuuu.

Ellie enters, covering the mouth of her phone, with a curious
but excited look on her face.

                    ELLIE
          Hey babe. Making more friends with
          the neighbors?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Just marking our territory.
              (off her look)
          Wait, that’s the same face you made
          when you backed into that cop car.
          Should I be calling a lawyer?

                    ELLIE
          I’m actually on the phone with my
          parents and they’re, uh, inviting
          us to their 4th of July weekend...

                    SEBASTIAN
          Hold up, did you just say “us”? I’m
          getting the nod? Ellie, I thought
          this trip was for family only...

                    ELLIE
          I know! I’m so torn between
          thinking this great news or that I
          might be dragging you into an
          Italian version of “Get Out”.
              (into the phone)
          Yeah, hold on, I’m asking him now!
              (to Sebastian, excited)
          What do you think, dude?

Sebastian stares at Ellie, super intensely. It’s hard to tell
what he’s thinking, then a single tear rolls down his cheek.
                                                           15.


                    ELLIE (CONT’D)
          Hup, he’s man-crying again. That
          means it’s a yes. Gah! Mom, this is
          so exciting! We can’t wait!

Sebastian watches Ellie exit, as the tears keep flowing.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          So yeah, I’m a big crier. I love to
          marinate in my own tears. But this
          was a huge deal. Ellie’s summer
          place wasn’t just the perfect spot
          to propose to her -- it also meant
          her family was starting to accept
          me. Which meant a lot, ‘cause --
          how do I put this eloquently --
          these people got class up the ass.

Sebastian crosses to a framed photo of a gorgeous, WASP-y
family gathered on the steps of their fancy summer place.
They’re all dressed impeccably in red, white, and blue.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          I mean, look at these perfect
          people with their perfect postures
          and perfect teeth. I swear, if you
          get close enough to the picture?
              (Sebastian huffs it)
          You can smell the fresh lobster on
          their breath.

We push into the scene of the photo, as Ellie’s delightful
family comes to life, giggling and posing...

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          And they intimidated me. Which
          didn’t make total sense as their
          story was also an immigrant story...

We drift out of the scene and up into “Google Earth” imagery,
then race across the Atlantic ocean toward Plymouth, England.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          But for some reason it’s considered
          more respectable as it started four
          hundred years ago, on a little boat
          called The Mayflower. Yeah, that one.

We show a portrait of a stern-looking Pilgrim standing with
his family, with the famous boat in the background.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          This is an actual painting of
          Ellie’s tenth great grandfather...

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Francis Love Collins -- taking his
          family to America. My family only
          ever took one portrait together --
          after my Dad got a free coupon from
          Sears. Ellie’s family’s been taking
          ‘em for half a millennium.

An NFL-style telestrator shows the following on the portrait:

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          And unlike my parents, who left for
          America with nothing, her people
          came with everything -- money,
          furniture, even other people. This
          hacked off Irish dude was their
          “indentured servant.” That’s right.
          Ellie’s ancestors were so WASP-y,
          even their slaves were white.

At Ellie’s summer house, we push down a long hall of stern-
looking portraits of men all named “Francis Love Collins”...

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          So while my father came to chase
          the American dream; the Collins
          were the American dream... and
          they’ve been living it all the way
          up to Ellie’s dad: Francis Love
          Collins The Twelfth.

...ending on Ellie’s Dad “Francis Love Collins XII” (aka
”FRANK” -- kind, well-educated, can dominate a board room but
may have trouble pumping his own gas).

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Crazy, right? Only Italian guy I
          ever knew with Roman numerals after
          his name was Rocky Balboa.

We quickly flip through posters of the many “Rocky” movies.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Anyway, her dad goes by “Frank” and
          he’s the Chairman and CEO of the
          luxurious Collins Hotel Group...

A “Collins Hotel Group” portfolio book opens and flips
through old school properties, ending on a gorgeous one.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          ...which was awkward, as I happened
          to run a cool new boutique hotel
          that was stealing a lot of his
          Chicago business...

                                                        17.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          So yeah, his baby girl was dating
          the enemy...

We then spin across the street to find Sebastian, wearing a
nice suit, opening the doors to a newer, trendier hotel.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          But Frank wasn’t even the scary
          parent. That honor belonged to
          Ellie’s mom, whose actual birth
          name was, “Tigger MacArthur”.

We see TIGGER (60s, old money, Ivy-educated, like Plutonium --
she’s thrilling to be around but also might kill you)
engaging in a CNN talking head yell fight with ANA NAVARRO.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          And that kitty’s got claws. As an
          Ivy League grad turned senator for
          the State of Maryland, it took her
          a long time to wrap her mind around
          her beloved daughter dating some
          working-class hotel manager.

                    TIGGER (ON TV)
          Maybe start taking those chill pills
          as suppositories, Ms. Navarro! If I
          was as anti-immigrant as you say I
          am, would I really let my daughter
          date the son of one?!

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          But this invite meant I was finally
          breaking through. And a long
          weekend away was my chance to
          finish charming the pleated pants
          off these people, and then ask for
          their daughter’s hand in marriage.

Ellie reenters and moves flirtatiously into Sebastian’s arms,
dabbing the tears from his eyes with some Kleenex.

                    ELLIE
          I can’t believe it, babe! You’re
          gonna love it so much out there. In
          fact, you may not want to leave.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Pfft. You know these kinda places
          aren’t really my scene.

                    ELLIE
          I dunno. It’s right on the lake...
                                                        18.


                    SEBASTIAN
          In my house, water was for drinking
          or wetting down hair before a cut.
          I barely know how to swim.

                    ELLIE
          The tennis courts are all grass...

                    SEBASTIAN
          I’m still getting used to the hard.

                    ELLIE
          My parents bend over backwards to
          show us kids a good time.

                    SEBASTIAN
          With all my issues? I won’t be
          comfortable with any of it.

                    ELLIE
              (snuggling into him)
          Which is what I love about you.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          So I had the girl I wanted to marry,
          the perfect spot to propose to her,
          and now I just needed the ring.
          Which should’ve been easy to get...


EXT. SALVO’S HOUSE - BACKYARD GARDEN - DAY

Annoyed, Sebastian peers into an overgrown vegetable garden.

                    SEBASTIAN
          What do you mean, you won’t give me
          the ring? Grandma left it for me to
          use when I’m ready to get married.

                    SALVO (O.S.)
          No! She left it with me, so I can
          make sure you don’t just give it
          away to some random girl.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Can you please come out of the damn
          garden so we can talk about this?!

Salvo emerges from the plants, like a sniper. He’s now older --
with his spine even more curved, and his pony-tailed hair
balding in the front -- but arguably prouder than ever, as he
rises, sweaty and shirtless, with a bandana tied around his
head, and dirt caked into his face and chest hair.
                                                        19.


                    SALVO
          Keep your voice down, son. We’re
          under attack.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Jesus, Dad. I shouldn’t have to
          keep telling you this, but ‘Nam
          ended like fifty years ago.

                    SALVO
          Pfft. I was a combat tracker for
          two tours and believe me, the Viet
          Cong ain’t got nothing on these
          varmint son-of-a-bitches.

Salvo carefully follows some tracks over to his cucumbers.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Well, can’t you at least track them
          down with a shirt on? Your
          neighbors are gonna call the cops
          when they see you dressed like
          “Rambo of the Radicchio”.

                    SALVO
          This bastard is a threat to my
          garden! And this garden feeds our
          family! What are you gonna do in
          winter if we ain’t got no vedge?

                    SEBASTIAN
          I dunno! Drive to the Shop ‘n Save?

                    SALVO
          Don’t no Maniscalco man pay for
          vegetables. Vegetables are free!
              (looks at cucumber)
          Now watchu think made these bites?
          Is it a rat? Maybe a raccoon?
              (licks it, then, sinister)
          Possum. Oh, I’m gonna murder this
          thing the family way: by soaking
          some baloney in the antifreeze!

Salvo opens some baloney and pours antifreeze on it.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          When I was a kid I thought every-
          thing my dad did was normal. Like
          protecting our garden at any cost.
          If some string beans went missing?
          I’d wake up the next morning to a
          yard full of poisoned squirrels,
          birds, chipmunks...
                    (MORE)
                                                         20.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Basically anything that ever helped
          Cinderella get dressed, dead in our
          backyard.

As Salvo tosses baloney slices, Sebastian notices some
neighbors starting to watch and tries to block their view.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          And whatever crazy he had back then,
          exploded after my mom passed away.
          Their once pristine house was now
          littered with old suits, records,
          and bottles of wine -- giving me a
          nice picture of what Frank Sinatra
          would’ve looked like as a hoarder.

Sebastian goes over to his dad, keeping his voice low.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Hey, before you commit possum
          genocide, can you just admit that
          Ellie ain’t some “random girl”? I
          love her, you love her, just give
          me the ring so I can propose!

                    SALVO
          Of course I love her! She’s perfect.
          In fact, her only red flag is
          choosing to be with you.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Thanks for the confidence boost.

Salvo considers for a beat, then turns to this son.

                    SALVO
          Sebastian, I will give you the ring.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Yes! Thank you, Dad!

                    SALVO
          But first I gotta meet her family.

                    SEBASTIAN
          What?! Why?!

                    SALVO
          Non mangi il frutto, finché non sai
          che l'albero non è malato.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Totally! What’s that mean?
                                       21.


          SALVO
You got no respect for your roots.
    (translating)
“You don’t eat the fruit, ‘til you
make sure the tree ain’t sick.”
    (explaining)
Per tradition, I need to meet her
parents so I can stare into their
eyes and look for the rot.

          SEBASTIAN
Oh Dad, trust me, there’s no rot in
Ellie’s family. They’re classy,
plus they don’t live anywhere near
here. Can’t I just get set you guys
up on a Skype date so you can
“taste-test” them over the phone?

          SALVO
No way. Needs to be face-to-face.

          SEBASTIAN
Well here’s the thing: I was kinda
hoping to propose next weekend. At
her family’s house in Virginia.

          SALVO
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. It’s the
first summer since we had to say
goodbye to your poor mother...
    (kissing, to sky)
Ti amo amore mio!
    (back to Sebastian)
And you’re gonna leave me alone for
the goddamn Fourth of July?!

          SEBASTIAN
Well it’s just, her parents invited
me out to their summer place and--

          SALVO
Summer place, huh?! Most people got
one home, these people have ‘em for
different seasons?! Must be nice!

          SEBASTIAN
So they got more money than us, who
doesn’t? And it’s just one weekend--

          SALVO
Oohhh just one weekend he says! ONE
WEEKEND! Fifty years ago, I come to
America to give a better life FOR
YOU!

                    SALVO (CONT'D)
          Skip EVERY weekend in Sicily FOR
          YOU! I fight in US Army to give
          freedoms FOR YOU! What thanks I
          get?! YOU GO TO CELEBRATE THIS DAY
          OF FREEDOM WITH SOME OTHER FAMILY,
          LEAVING ME TO BURN THE SPARKLERS AND
          EAT THE HOT DOGS, ALL ALONE!
              (to sky, in Italian)
          YOU SHOULDA LET ME LEAVE HIM AT
          THAT ORPHANAGE SO HE COULD GROW UP
          TO BREAK SOME OTHER FATHER’S HEART!

                    SEBASTIAN
          Okay, I’m pretty sure I just heard
          the word “orphanage” in there, so I
          guess I’ll go tell Ellie I can’t
          make it this time. Jesus.

                    SALVO
          Ok. If that’s what you want to do.

Sebastian rolls his eyes. As Salvo happily goes back to his
poisoning, Sebastian exits, passing the gathered neighbors.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Nice to see ya, Mrs. Aquavella. If
          I were you, I’d keep those ferrets
          inside for the next week or so.


INT. SEBASTIAN AND ELLIE'S TOWNHOUSE - LATER

Dressed from work, Sebastian talks to Ellie, who looks upset.

                    ELLIE
          What do you mean you’re not coming?

                    SEBASTIAN
          I just can’t leave my father. He’s
          been so lonely since my mom passed
          and, you know, the Fourth of July
          was always their favorite holiday.

                    ELLIE
          Because of his military background?

                    SEBASTIAN
          More because it’s the one holiday
          you don’t have to buy gifts and
          watching fireworks is free.

Ellie nods like she’s disappointed but really she’s thinking.
                                                          23.


                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          I’m sorry babe. We’ll find another--

                    ELLIE
          Why don’t we just bring him?

                    SEBASTIAN
              (taken aback)
          What’s that now?

                    ELLIE
          If your dad’s into the Fourth, he’d
          love it at our place. There’s
          fireworks, a parade, we even host a
          mini American Revolution with paint-
          ball guns in case he wants to light
          up some rich kids. It’s perfect!

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          My father? Getting a close-up look
          at my new life while I try to seal
          the deal with Ellie’s parents? What
          an incredible idea!

                    SEBASTIAN
          Yeah, I don’t think so. I should
          probably just stay here with him.

                    ELLIE
          What? No way! Don’t you want our
          families to meet?

                    SEBASTIAN
              (high-pitched)
          Yeah! Of course I do!

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          I really didn’t.

                    ELLIE
          Oh come on, Sebastian! What, are
          you, like, embarrassed of him?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Me? No! Noooo. No! What? No!

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Okay, maybe I was a little scared
          to bring my father into a country
          club environment where he’d see me
          playing fancy sports, eating meals
          out, and sleeping in past five am.

Sebastian stares at Ellie, knowing what he needs to do.
                                                        24.


                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          But I also knew that the stubborn
          bastard wouldn’t give me the ring
          without a face-to-face meeting. So
          I realized if I could just get
          through one weekend with everyone
          together, I’d be on my way to
          marrying Ellie and never have to
          worry about this issue again...

                    SEBASTIAN
          Alright. You win. I’ll go ask him.

Ellie squeals with delight and jumps into Sebastian’s arms.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          But don’t get excited. My dad’s big
          on tradition; I doubt he’ll say yes.


INT. SALVO’S SALON - THE NEXT DAY

Salvo cuts an older lady’s hair, holding court in a fun and
loud ‘90s salon. Sebastian stands sheepishly before him.

                    SALVO
          HELL YES! I would love to come!

                    SEBASTIAN
          Wait, seriously?

                    SALVO
          What are we gonna do instead...
              (”so depressing”)
          Spend the whole weekend, just the
          two of us, alone in my house,
          burning the sparklers and eating
          the hot dogs?

                    SEBASTIAN
          You used that same exact example to
          guilt trip me into not going!

                    SALVO
          What can I say, I got a way with
          words. Ladies, get your ‘dos done
          by Thursday ‘cause I’m closing the
          salon for the first time since ‘94!

The salon crowd cheers for Salvo, who is in his absolute
element here. As Salvo dances around and has animated chats
with his clientele, Sebastian looks at his him, concerned.
                                                        25.


                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.
          Did I not mention my dad runs a
          salon? With the Army and the tough
          life lessons, most people assume
          he’s a cop or a bricklayer. But no,
          he’s a hair stylist. And don’t you
          dare call him a barber. This man
          don’t cut hair; he creates styles.

Salvo lifts a dryer and spins a FEMALE CLIENT to the mirror
so she can see her feathery new hairdo.

                    FEMALE CLIENT
          Oh, Salvo! It’s beautiful!

                    SALVO
          I knew you had some cheek bones
          under there -- you just needed
          Michelangelo to dig them out!

Salvo then blasts her with double barrels of hairspray. As
she fades into a fog of CFC’s, Sebastian steps over to Salvo.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Okay, Dad. If we’re actually gonna
          do this, I gotta ask you to please
          be on your best behavior.

                    SALVO
          What do you mean, my best behavior?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Well, Ellie’s family is pretty
          uptight and conservative and--

                    SALVO
          Hold on-- are you, the son, telling
          me, the father, how to behave?

The salon crowd boos Sebastian as Salvo turns back to him.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Just remember: the main goal is for
          you to meet the family so I can get
          the ring and propose to Ellie. It’s
          not for you to price check their
          antique coffee tables!

                     SALVO
          Oh, come on! How fancy can a stupid
          coffee table be?
              (then)
          Seriously, how much we talking?
                                                        26.


                    SEBASTIAN
          Dad.

                    SALVO
          I’m kidding! Ingrato son-of-a--.

                    SEBASTIAN
          All I’m asking is for you to dial
          it down a little with all the...

Sebastian does a spot-on impression of his flamboyant dad
judging people around him. Oblivious, Salvo does the exact
same motions as he complains about Sebastian to his clients.

                    SALVO
          Ah, I see. He’s worried about his
          immigrant father making him look
          like some kind of Goomba.

Salvo slaps Sebastian on the neck, affectionately.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          You probably forget this ‘cause I’m
          your dad, but the rest of the world
          finds me pretty damn charming.
          Isn’t that right, ladies?!

The crowd cheers for Salvo as he turns back to Sebastian.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          Trust me, these stuck-up rich people
          have a word for people like me...

                    SEBASTIAN
          Loud? Obnoxious? Over-cologned?

                    SALVO
          It’s “refreshing!” I promise you
          Ellie’s parents are gonna love me!
          In fact, they might want me to
          marry their daughter!

The crowd laughs and cheers as Salvo does his classic Salvo
dances toward Sebastian, forcing him out the door.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          Now get the hell out of here and go
          pack your bags!
              (to sky)
          Ya hear that, honey? The Maniscalco
          men are going on vacation!

On Sebastian’s somewhat hopeful smile, the Sinatra music
kicks up as we dissolve into the next leg of our journey...
          27.




“PRIMI”
                                                          28.


EXT. REMOTE VIRGINIA AIRPORT - DAYS LATER

A small prop plane grinds to a halt. As Ellie, Sebastian, and
Salvo disembark, we hear the following VO:

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Growing up, my father took me on
          exactly one “vacation” -- a three-
          day trip to Memphis where we spent
          two hours looking through the fence
          at Graceland... and the rest of the
          time filling up a U-Haul with used
          salon equipment he’d bought from a
          bankrupt hairdresser. So, going on
          a trip with him was kinda fun...

Ellie takes a big huff of the country air, invigorated.

                    ELLIE
          Oh my gosh, the air is so fresh!

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          ...but mostly it was strange.

Sebastian goes to breathe it in, but coughs on a big cloud of
smoke. REVEAL: Salvo trailing, having just lit a Jewel Cigar.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Dad, you can’t smoke here.

                    SALVO
          Pfft. You sound just like that
          uppity stewardess.

Salvo takes another big drag and Sebastian dodges the exhale.

                    ELLIE
          Isn’t this so beautiful, Salvo?

                    SALVO
              (shrugs)
          It’s a lotta trees.

                    ELLIE
          Trust me, you’re gonna have so much
          fun. There’s tennis and swimming
          and horseback riding.

                    SALVO
          Sounds like a white collar prison.

Salvo looks for an ally in Sebastian, who smiles back.
                                                         29.


                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          The guy was clearly uncomfortable,
          so I tried to put him at ease by
          speaking his language: cheap.

                    SEBASTIAN
          So Dad, I got some good news.
          Through one of my hotel connects, I
          was able to secure us a luxury
          sedan for the price of a compact.

                    SALVO
          Nice work. But makes me wonder what
          you could’ve got the compact for--

                    SEBASTIAN
          And then! I used that price to get
          us the compact on the house.

             SALVO                     SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
   (loving that)                    (loving him loving that)
Heyyyyy!                         Heyyyyy!

Proud, Sebastian then puts an arm around Ellie.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          So how long’s the drive, babe?

                    ELLIE
          About three hours.

                    LUCKY (O.S.)
          Unless y’all want to ride with me?

They turn to see LUCKY (30s, cocky, well-groomed, kinda like
a purebred horse brought to life). He’s dressed in a flight
suit and holds a helicopter helmet under his arms.

                    ELLIE
          Oh my god, LUCKY!!!!

Ellie runs and jumps into Lucky’s arms, spread-eagling her
legs around his torso. Salvo lean into Sebastian.

                    SALVO
          Whoa. Is this an ex-boyfriend?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Worse. It’s her brother.

Salvo cringes as they watch Ellie and Lucky repeatedly kiss
each other on the cheeks...
                                                        30.


                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          While I’d made some progress with
          Ellie’s parents, I’d made none with
          her older brother. His name was
          Frances Love Collins the 13th, so
          everyone called him “Lucky”. And
          that’s exactly what this dude was.


EXT. IVY LEAGUE COLLEGE - FLASHBACK

We pan from a library to an Eating Club where Lucky finishes
sucking down his share of a three-story beer bong...

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          After graduating from Princeton,
          back when you could safely bribe
          your way into college, Lucky was on
          deck to take over the Hotel Group.
          In the meantime, he was working as
          a “Client Liaison.” Which meant
          traveling around the world
          entertaining wealthy clients with
          all the rich kid hobbies he’d had
          time to master while I was busy
          mowing lawns to pay off unfinished
          chow mein. We’re talking skiing...


INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - QUICK POPS

-- Lucky carves a perfect powder trail, as others follow.

                       SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Sailing...

-- Lucky leans off the port side of a sailboat, balancing it.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          All the country club sports...

-- Lucky hits a pure four-iron, then turns to the group...

                    LUCKY
          Shit, I better change my shoes...

As the ball lands behind him on the green, he pumps his arm.

                    LUCKY (CONT’D)
          ...‘cause I’m on the dance floor!

The rich dude foursome all Golf-Laughs hard together.
                                                        31.


                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          But I’d say his over all best skill
          was... being a prick.


EXT. REMOTE VIRGINIA AIRPORT - BACK TO PRESENT

Lucky finally puts Ellie down and turns to Sebastian.

                    LUCKY
          So happy you’re here, sis! I see
          you’re still banging the bellboy.
              (laughs, to Sebastian)
          I’m just joking, Sea Bass. Como
          estai, amigo?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Hey, Luck. How ya doing, man?

Lucky shakes Sebastian’s hand and turns it into a bro hug.

                    LUCKY
          Ah, so great. Just got back from
          shredding pow in Zermatt. It was a
          huge winter so they still had snow
          in freaking June, man. It’s like
          global warming, my ass, right?
              (then, to Salvo)
          You must be Sebastian’s brother.

                    SALVO
          I’m Salvo. His father.

                    LUCKY
          What?! No way. Seriously?!
              (to Ellie)
          Man, it’s so hard to tell the age
          of anyone over forty. Let me goose
          you boys some free samps...

Lucky pulls two fancy bottles of lotion from his bag.

                    LUCKY (CONT’D)
          I’m an angel investor in this new
          anti-aging cream for men and, as
          you can tell, I’m also a client.

Salvo and Sebastian share a look like: fuck this guy.

                    LUCKY (CONT’D)
          Shall we saddle up?

Lucky straps on his helmet and struts to a helicopter. Ellie
excitedly follows. Salvo does too, but Sebastian is nervous.
                                                        32.


                    SEBASTIAN
          Ellie, you sure you don’t want to
          take the car I reserved?

                    ELLIE
          No way! The helicopter takes twenty
          minutes plus the views are magical.

Ellie kisses Sebastian and pulls him to the helicopter. Salvo
takes one last drag, apprehensive, then genuflects.

                    SALVO
              (to sky, in Italian)
          I might see you soon, my love!


INT. LUCKY’S HELICOPTER - MINUTES LATER

Lucky talks into his headset, as Ellie rides shotgun.

                    LUCKY
          Alright boys and girl, we have lift
          off. Next stop: Mom and Dad’s!

Ellie whoops as the chopper rises away from the airfield.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          My whole life, I’d heard that rich
          people have “grace.” And I thought
          it was a load of crap, until I
          started spending time with them.

                    LUCKY
          If you look out to the left, you’ll
          notice the Blue Ridge Mountains.

Lucky and Ellie lean out, so comfortable, as we pan around
the cockpit to find Salvo, who is far less comfortable.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Truth is, they are graceful with
          certain things ‘cause they’ve had
          so much time to get used to them.
          Like, using chopsticks, or knowing
          what to do with those hot napkins
          they give you on airplanes... and
          of course staying calm while flying
          through the sky in a hot metal box.

                    SALVO
          Good god, son. Are you okay?

REVEAL: Sebastian, clearly in a panic, breathing heavily and
sweating through his multiple layers of clothing.
                                                           33.


                    SEBASTIAN
          Yah. Just getting used to the
          altitude. And the open doors.

Sebastian starts to hyperventilate and tug at his clothes.

                    SALVO
          Hey Ellie, I think we might have a
          problem back here!

Ellie turns around and sees Sebastian suffering.

                    ELLIE
          Oh my god, babe! Are you okay? You
          look like you’re melting.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Yeah. It’s just a little hot. And
          I’m having some trouble breathing.

Sebastian gasps, sweating more. Lucky turns around, sees him.

                    LUCKY
          Dude! Don’t you dare vom in my
          bird!

                    ELLIE
          Lucky, maybe we should turn back.

                    LUCKY
          What?! It’s only nineteen more
          minutes! Can’t he tough it out?

                    ELLIE
          Babe, do you think you can make it--

Sweat now pours off his body as he aggressively sheds layers.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I can’t breathe! I’m gonna die! I’M
          GONNA DIIIIIIII--


INT. A VERY PEACEFUL RENTAL CAR - LATER

Ellie drives as Sebastian rides. Salvo sits in the back.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Soooo, that was my first time in a
          helicopter.

                    ELLIE
          No way. Really? You seemed so calm!
                                                        34.


                    SALVO
          It’s embarrassing. I knew I should
          have forced you to join the Army.

                    ELLIE
          Look at the bright side: If my
          parents ask you to be in the big
          family photo, you just shed about
          forty pounds of water weight.

Salvo and Ellie share a laugh at that.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Yuk it up, guys. But I feel much
          safer down here on the ground.

                    ELLIE
          I know, babe. And the drive is just
          as nice. In fact, here we are!
          Gentlemen? Welcome to “White Oak”!

They round a bend, and take in an elegant country club vista,
which has been tastefully decorated for the Fourth of July.

                      SEBASTIAN / SALVO
          Wowwwwww!

                    ELLIE
          Right? So this is the golf course,
          down there are the tennis courts.

                    SALVO
          What the hell are those guys doing?
          Besides dressing like pieces of a
          stained glass window...

Salvo points to GUYS in pastel clothes who are converting
their golf cart into a hot dog in front of a large estate.

                    ELLIE
          They must be building their float
          for the parade on Saturday.

                    SALVO
          A parade celebrating what -- having
          too much time on their hands?

                    ELLIE
              (poking Sebastian)
          Hey! That voice sounds familiar.
              (then, braking)
          And awwww, look! It’s Sgt. Feathers
          and his family! What up, dudes?!
                                                          35.


Ellie stops next to a pond, where a family of peacocks waddle
across the road. A nearby sign shows: “Peacock Crossing.”

                    SALVO
          Virginia’s got peacocks?!

                    ELLIE
          No. My grandfather’s friend brought
          them here as pets years ago, but
          they didn’t like their cages so he
          just decided to let them roam free.
          Now, they’ve pretty much become the
          official mascots of our club.

As Ellie drives on, Salvo watches the peacocks waddle away.

                    SALVO
          How much a peacock cost anyway?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Don’t answer that, El.

                    ELLIE
          Copy that. And this is our house!

Sebastian and Salvo lay their eyes on a small structure, then
share an unimpressed look.

                    SALVO
          Huh. No offense, but I expected
          something a little bigger.

                    ELLIE
          Oh, sorry, no. That’s just my
          little brother’s converted barn.
          That is the main house.

Sebastian and Salvo turn to see a magnificent property.

                      SEBASTIAN / SALVO
          Wowwwwww!


EXT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - MINUTES LATER

Ellie parks in front of a huge house, where Frank and Tigger
(in golf clothes and tennis whites, respectively) wait for
them with Lucky and DUKE, an energetic Irish Wolfhound.

Frank and Tigger rush over and greet Ellie, enthusiastically.

            FRANK                            TIGER
Ellie-bellie! Come to papa!      My little cuddle monkey!
                                                          36.


They wrap each other up, giving each other all kinds of hugs
and kisses. Salvo leans into Sebastian, concerned.

                    SALVO
          Family’s a little handsy, huh?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Lotta parents hug their kids, Dad.
          Unlike you, who first saw me in the
          delivery room and chose to shake my
          hand.

                    SALVO
          You were covered in placenta! Plus,
          I didn’t want to burn you with my
          cigar.

Duke the dog charges over and starts jumping on them.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Looking back, this all had to be a
          little overwhelming for my father.
          Unlike him, I’d had time to realize
          that there’s a certain formula to
          wealthy families. Starting with the
          tough mom who’s always dressed for
          the sport she’s about to play...

Tigger (in tennis whites) turns to Sebastian and Salvo.

                    TIGGER
          Sebastian! Hi babe! Sorry I’m not
          dressed up, but I’ve got a doubles
          match after lunch.

Tigger turns to Salvo, as they size each other up with their
respective, domineering Type-A energy. And like two magnets,
they’re riding a fine line between attraction and repulsion.

                    TIGGER (CONT’D)
          And you must be the charming father
          who gets to spend way more time
          with my daughter than I do!

                    SALVO
          Nice to finally meet you in person,
          Tigger. Just last week, I was
          checking out your highlights on TV.

                    TIGGER
          Oh fun! The CNN or FOX ones?
                                                         37.


                    SALVO
          The blonde ones. Your hair...
              (touches her head)
          It’s like a block of marble I just
          want to sink my tools into. Have
          you ever thought about--

                    SEBASTIAN
          Okay, Dad. Please stop touching
          other people’s heads.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Next up is the self-deprecating
          father who’s usually still dressed
          from the sport he just finished.

                    FRANK
          Yes, we’ve heard you’re quite the
          stylist, Salvo! Anything you can do
          to help me?

Frank removes his golfer’s hat to reveal his bald head. He
laughs hard at his own joke. Salvo doesn’t really think it’s
that funny, but the others join in. Especially Lucky.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          ...then their oldest kid who still
          gets an allowance from the family,
          so he treats his father like most
          of us would treat a boss.

                    LUCKY
          Good one, sir! Alright, I’m gonna
          go hit the links. Hit me up on my
          private line if you need anything.

Lucky salutes Frank, then speeds off in a golf cart, nearly
hitting Sebastian.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Also, a second, more independent
          child who both parents wish would
          spend more time with the family...

Ellie leans into Tigger and Frank, holding them tight.

                    TIGGER
          Awww, it feels so good to have our
          baby girl back in the nest!

                    FRANK
          The artist formerly known as our
          little princess. Haha!
                    (MORE)
                                                        38.

                    FRANK (CONT'D)
              (hugs her tight)
          This finally feels like a vacation.

As they all hug, Salvo leans into Sebastian.

                    SALVO
          I never treated you like that. I
          didn’t want you to get a big head.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Mission accomplished.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          And then there are some fun bonus
          options, like a giant dog the
          family refuses to discipline...

Duke keeps jumping up on Sebastian and trying to jam his nose
in his crotch. No one does anything to try and stop him.

                    FRANK
          Don’t mind Duke. He likes attention
          ‘cause he’s a millennial!

Frank laughs at his bad joke. Ellie and Tigger join in. Salvo
looks at Sebastian like -- what the fuck are we laughing at?

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          And a weird third kid that everyone
          treats like an overgrown toddler.

Tigger sees Salvo staring at DOUG (20s, out-of-shape, thinks
it’s cool to have a beard, but really he’s just too lazy to
shave) as he meditates by his house in full yoga gear.

                    TIGGER
          That’s our Doug. He’s meditating.

                    FRANK
          Supposed to be great for his ADHD.

                    DOUG
              (without opening his eyes)
          I can fucking hear you.

                    FRANK
          We’re so proud of him.
              (to Doug)
          You! We’re so proud of you, dude.

Sebastian notices Salvo watching, incredulously.
                                                        39.


                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Yup. This was gonna be a lot for my
          old man to handle. So much like the
          old waterbed he slept in at home, I
          was gonna have to help ease him in.

                    TIGGER
          So is anybody hungry for lunch? We
          could go down to “The Shack.”

                    SEBASTIAN
          What do you think, Dad? I could eat.

                    SALVO
          Thanks, but I already had some food
          I brought on the flight. Packed
          enough for three, but these guys
          didn’t want any.

                    ELLIE
          Yeah, for some reason I wasn’t in
          the mood for sardines and taleggio
          cheese. Possibly ‘cause it made the
          whole plane smell like a wet sock.

                    SEBASTIAN
          He used to send me to school with
          meals like that. I was the only kid
          in first grade who had to
          refrigerate his lunchbox.

Everyone chuckles, as Sebastian gives Salvo a pointed look.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          But we’d love to go, right Dad?
          Might be nice for us all to get to
          know each other over a meal?

                    SALVO
              (getting the hint)
          Yeah, okay. That sounds nice.

                    DOUG
          I’ll drive!

Doug jumps up and runs to another golf cart, as Salvo and
Sebastian avert their eyes from his Spandexed moose knuckle.


INT. COUNTRY CLUB DINING ROOM - LATER

Sebastian sits between Salvo and Ellie across from Frank,
Tigger, and Doug in this big, impressive clubhouse.
                                                          40.


                    SEBASTIAN
          This club is huge, Frank!

                    FRANK
          Yes, I suppose it has been built up
          over the years, but to us? It’ll
          always be “The Shack”.

                    SEBASTIAN
          And Dad... what do you think?

Everyone turns to Salvo, who’s preoccupied by the menu.

                    SALVO
          This menu. It ain’t got no prices.

                    ELLIE
          Oh, don’t worry about it, Salvo.
          They just put it on our account.

Confused, Salvo looks to Sebastian, who nervously pivots:

                    SEBASTIAN
          And wow, these tables are gorgeous!

                    TIGGER
          Yes! If you look underneath,
          they’re actually wagon wheels
          salvaged from the original carts
          that brought all the materials up
          to build White Oak.

Sebastian nods, politely impressed, then Doug butts in:

                    DOUG
          This whole place was built by
          slaves.

                       FRANK
          Douglas.

                    DOUG
          What? I can’t tell the truth now?
              (to Sebastian)
          They’ll never admit it, but we’re
          dining in a house of oppression.

                       SEBASTIAN
          Ohhhh-kay.

                    FRANK
          Sure, a lot of the south has a...
          checkered past, but that was long
          before we bought our place here.
                                                        41.


                    DOUG
          I can’t even bring my girlfriend,
          because I’m so ashamed.
              (explaining)
          She’s African.

                    TIGGER
          “She” is a person emailing you from
          Africa, and to whom you are sending
          back money. We have yet to confirm
          whether she’s a girl or a friend.

                    DOUG
              (proud)
          They just can’t stand that I’m in
          an interracial relationship.

A plucky waitress, GLORIA, shows up.

                    FRANK
          Oh thank god. Afternoon, Gloria!

                    GLORIA
          Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Collins! What can
          I get for you guys today?

                    DOUG
          Chocolate milk and chicken nuggets.

                     FRANK
          “Please,” Dougie. And you know we
          always let guests order first.
              (then)
          Know what you want, Sebastian?

                    SEBASTIAN
          I’ll just take a Cobb salad please.

                    ELLIE
          Ho-ho! Cool order, Carrie Bradshaw!
          Don’t you want a starter?
              (poking his tummy)
          They have tuna carpaccio! My baby
          loves a nice raw fish.

Sebastian can feel Salvo watching and gets self-conscious.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Thanks, but I’m just gonna stick to
          the middle of the menu.

                    ELLIE
          Alright. What about you, Salvo?
                                                           42.


                    SALVO
          Uh, yeah, hi there Gloria. This BLT
          that comes with onion rings... how
          much we talking for that dish?

Everyone else is a little embarrassed, as it gets quiet.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          What? What’d I say?

Gloria looks for help from Tigger and Frank, who steps in.

                    FRANK
          Salvo, I know this sounds silly but
          the ethos of this place is “getting
          away from regular life”. That’s why
          we have no cell towers or Internet
          or newspapers, and we don’t like to
          put prices on things as that’s just
          an annoying reminder of money.

A long beat as Salvo tries to process this impossibility.

                    SALVO
          So... all this food is free?

                    FRANK
          Well, no, it’s not free.

                    SALVO
          Then what, they just make up a price?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Dad stop, it’s not--

                    SALVO
          Son, I’m talking to Frank here.

                    FRANK
          No, they do have a set price. But
          at the end of the week, they just
          tally it all up and send me a bill.

                    SALVO
          I get it. Gloria, if you don’t
          mind, I would love to have... a
          chat with whoever knows the prices?

Sebastian throws his hands up, frustrated.

                    TIGGER
          Salvo, please, it would be our
          pleasure to treat you.
                                                        43.


                    SALVO
          No way. You’re already doing too
          much by putting us up in your home.

Sebastian leans into Salvo, trying to be discreet.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Dad, stop. It’s not a big deal.

                    SALVO
          I know it’s not! You’re the one
          making a big deal out of it!

Other diners start to notice the rising commotion. Salvo is
un-fazed and smiles nicely to the waitress.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          So Gloria, be a doll and find out
          how much it is for a BLT and a--
              (to Sebastian)
          What’d you get again?

                    SEBASTIAN
              (small)
          A cobb salad.

                    SALVO
          A cobb salad!

Everyone jumps in, trying dissuade Salvo:

            ELLIE                           TIGER
Just let my parents pay.        Just let us pay.

            FRANK                         SEBASTIAN
Salvo, please let me pay!       Just let him pay!

                    DOUG
          If you guys want to pay for
          something, what about reparations?!

As they all overlap on each other, we SMASH CUT TO...


INT. SEBASTIAN AND SALVO’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Salvo arranges his array of colognes, as a grumpy Sebastian
finishes putting his clothes into the bureau.

                    SALVO
          I don’t get what you’re so upset
          about. A real man pays his own way.
                                                        44.


                    SEBASTIAN
          You’re supposed to be getting to
          know Ellie’s family and instead you
          made a big scene! Didn’t you notice
          that everyone was watching us?

                    SALVO
          Who cares? These people are strange.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Maybe to you.

                    SALVO
          Pfft, to me, and everyone else in
          the world! They like to “take a
          break from thinking about money”?
          Are you kidding me? Where I come
          from, that’s called dying.

Sebastian breaks a little, chuckling. He knows this is weird.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I’ll admit it’s a different life.

                    SALVO
          Hell yeah it is! Everyone dresses
          like we’re on a cruise. The men got
          hands so soft, I thought my
          callouses were gonna draw blood.
          And you notice how they downplay
          how fancy everything is? Like I
          can’t see with my own eyes.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Oh I’ve definitely noticed that.
              (doing an impression)
          The house is sixty thousand square
          feet and has thirteen bedrooms, but
          we like it ‘cause it’s cosy.

Salvo laughs, as Sebastian further softens.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          Then they do the opposite with the
          furniture -- making it all seem way
          more important than it is.

                    SALVO
          I know! It’s like you can’t just
          have a regular chair to sit in.
          It’s got to have a backstory.

Sebastian goes over to an old chair and fake-presents it.
                                                        45.


                    SEBASTIAN
          The wooden frame is built from
          pieces of an old Spanish galleon,
          and the canvases are harvested from
          androgynous whale butts.

They share a laugh, Sebastian goes back to normal.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          The only story behind the furniture
          in our house was, “You saw a La-Z-
          Boy out on the street, then pulled
          me out of school to go get it and
          now I don’t know geometry.”

                     SALVO
          Hey. In my experience, how to spot
          a good deal is way more useful than
          knowing how to draw a triangle.
              (then)
          Night cologne?

Sebastian nods and they spray their respective colognes, then
step dramatically through the clouds. As they climb into bed:

                    SEBASTIAN
          But Dad, I just want to remind you
          that we’re here because I want to
          marry Ellie. So try to give her
          family a chance tomorrow, okay?

                    SALVO
          I know. Don’t worry, I will.

Sebastian switches off the light. A beat, then:

                    SEBASTIAN
          These lamps are actually made from
          glass in the lighthouse where
          Ernest Hemingway first masturbated.

As they both crack up some more, we...


INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - LIBRARY - SAME TIME

Tigger, Ellie, Lucky, and Frank sip cocoa in pajamas by a
fire, while Doug plays a shooter game on his Nintendo D.S.,
wearing bulky headphones with a built-in microphone.

                    DOUG
          Sergeant Doug to Private O’Connor.
          You ready to kick some ass and take
          some dames?!
                                                        46.


Dough laughs as Tigger pulls a blanket up over her and Ellie.

                    TIGGER
          Mmm, we finally get you all to
          ourselves. So tell us -- what’s new
          in Chicago? How’s the art?

                    ELLIE
          It’s great. All the pieces from my
          last show sold out in eight days.

                    FRANK
          Attagirl! Your mom showed me the
          website. Just wonderful. We loved
          your subtle use of all those... uh--

                     ELLIE
          Vaginas?

                    FRANK
          That’s it! Such good fun.

                    ELLIE
          Thanks, Dad. There’s a big interior
          designer who’s become a huge fan
          and she keeps buying up my work.

                    TIGGER
          That’s so awesome, Ell!
              (then, leading)
          So now that you’re getting the
          contacts... you could pretty much
          start working from anywhere, right?

                     ELLIE
          Mom.

                    TIGGER
          What?! We miss having you in DC.

                    FRANK
          It’s true. These cheeks aren’t as
          fun to kiss on FaceTime.

Frank kisses Ellie and hugs her tight. Doug yells.

                    DOUG
          Ah what the shit, dude? Don’t bail
          on me now! You know I can’t take
          this base without my wingman!

                    ELLIE
          I totally miss you guys, too!
                                        47.


          LUCKY
Her voice went up; that’s a lie.
Dad, remember this moment whenever
you sit down to revise the will.

          ELLIE
Stop, Lucky. You know I’d love to
live closer to home, but Sebastian
has his dad and a great job--

          FRANK
Yeah, working for those damn Hiltons!

          LUCKY
Such a good gig. Do you still have
to have herpes to work there?

          ELLIE
The point is, he loves it and I
couldn’t just ask him to leave.

          TIGGER
We know. It’s just sometimes we
worry you’re giving up too much of
your old life to be there.

          ELLIE
We have a lot of fun, Mom.

          TIGGER
Sure, but... that house you guys
live in, it’s so cramped.

          ELLIE
We prefer modest.

          FRANK
You like never go on vacations.

          ELLIE
Because we’re working!

          LUCKY
And all that cologne? They made my
chopper smells like a Nordstroms.

          ELLIE
You get used to it over time.

          LUCKY
Right. Like if you were dating a
fishmonger or a garbageman.
                                                        48.


                    DOUG
              (into mic)
          Dude, just tell   her you’re the man
          of the house! I   doubt Martha
          Washington ever   made George get off
          the Delaware to   go take out the
          damn trash.

                    FRANK
          And you’re such a cheery person, Ell.
          Both of them seem so... angry.

                    ELLIE
          No, they all just suffer from
          ‘resting bitch face’. You should
          see their family tree -- it looks
          like the back of the line at a
          Sicilian DMV.

                    LUCKY
          Haha, they do kinda remind me of
          the snow monkeys we saw bathing in
          those Japanese hot springs...

Lucky points to a gorgeous photograph of those mean looking
monkeys soaking with just their angry faces poking out of the
steamy water (look it up). Lucky gets up and does an
impression of an angry-looking Sebastian and Salvo, rising
behind the couch slowly so that just his head is showing.

                    LUCKY (CONT’D)
              (as a grumpy Maniscalco)
          How much is a Cobb Salad?

Everyone laughs. Frank gets up and joins him in doing the
impression, also rising from behind the couch.

                    FRANK
          What do you mean I can’t smoke a
          cigar near that baby!

                    LUCKY
          Can I borrow an extension cord for
          my hair dryer?

Everyone is laughing now. Ellie stifles herself.

                    ELLIE
          Guys, stop! I’ll admit Salvo can
          be... a little intense, but just
          spend more time with Sebastian.
          You’ll see he’s totally opened his
          mind up to my interests too.
                                                          49.


Tigger and Frank smile, willing, as Doug wraps up his game.

                    DOUG
          Yeah, I can hear her yelling. Sorry
          if I got you in trouble, bro. Good
          luck on that social studies test!


EXT. THE WHITE OAK GROUNDS - THE NEXT MORNING

Sebastian (in an athletic track suit) and Salvo (in an all
black outfit with matching scissor purse), walk. They
repeatedly pass happy people -- jogging, walking, and on
beach cruisers -- who say good morning.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Look at us, huh? The Maniscalco men
          walking through a gated community --
          as guests, not groundskeepers.

                       SALVO
          Feels odd.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I know what you mean. Whenever I’m
          in places like this, I constantly
          feel like someone’s gonna come up
          and ask me to bartend.

They chuckle as a PASSING JOGGER approaches.

                    PASSING JOGGER
          Beautiful day, isn’t it?

                       SEBASTIAN
          Sure is!

                     SALVO
          Everyone here is so happy.
              (beat)
          What the hell’s wrong with ‘em?

                    SEBASTIAN
          I dunno, maybe their fathers let
          them sleep in past five forty-five.

                    SALVO
          I couldn’t stop thinking about how
          much work I’m missing.
              (checks watch)
          Could’ve done four dyes and a perm
          by now. That’s two electric bills.

A FRIENDLY WOMAN bikes toward them, wearing a bathrobe.
                                                         50.


                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          Look at this one, riding around in
          a damn bathrobe.

        FRIENDLY WOMAN                       SEBASTIAN
Morning!                        Morning!

                    SALVO
              (calling after her)
          What, no job?

                    SEBASTIAN
          She’s probably got her money
          working for her in stocks. And not
          a bunch of old mayonnaise jars she
          buried in the backyard.

                    SALVO
          You know I don’t trust no banks.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I’m just saying, these people may
          be odd but they’re smart. And they
          got connections. You know if I
          marry Ellie, there’s a good chance
          your grandson goes to Princeton.

                    SALVO
          A Maniscalco at an Ivy League?

                    SEBASTIAN
          It’s possible! And why you came to
          this country, no? So just try to
          relax and enjoy your time here.

                    SALVO
          I am relaxed. See? I got sandals on.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Well the rest of you looks like Paul
          Mitchell on his way to a funeral.

They approach the courts, where people play. Salvo scowls.

                    SALVO
          I can’t believe you’re gonna play
          tennis. What a stupid game.

                     SEBASTIAN
          I only said I’d play so you’d have
          time to talk to Frank.
              (then)
          Have you ever even tried playing?
                                                        51.


                    SALVO
          Why would I? It’s just a dumb game
          for stuck up people who, instead of
          working for a living, want to dress
          up in tighty whities and moan like
          they’re having sex.

They hear two women playing and grunting like that.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          You see that? If this was a porno
          movie, the director would be like
          “can you two take it down a notch?”
              (shakes head)
          It’s embarrassing.

As they climb the steps to the tennis courts, Sebastian self-
consciously zips up his jacket to cover his white clothes.


EXT. TENNIS COURTS - LATER

In the stands, Salvo watches with Frank and Doug, dressed in
overalls as he draws in a notebook. On the court, Ellie and
Lucky play doubles against Sebastian and an intense Tigger.

                    TIGGER
          So, Ellie tells me you’re becoming
          quite the player.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Eh, I’ve taken a couple lessons.

                    TIGGER
          Well get ready to bring it. I love
          my family everywhere, except on the
          tennis court. Chest bump!

                    SEBASTIAN
          Oh, I don’t know if--

                    TIGGER
          CHEST BUMP!

Tigger chest bumps Sebastian, weirding him -- and Salvo --
out, then takes her position at net. Lucky prepares to serve.

                    LUCKY
          I hope you’re wearing oven mitts,
          big boy. Cuz here comes the heat!

Sebastian readies to return, but feels Salvo watching him and
plays it cool, not wanting to show that he can play. Lucky
serves. Sebastian swings lamely and hits a lousy shot.
                                                        52.


                    LUCKY (CONT’D)
          Aw yeah! Call me “The Concierge”,
          bro -- cuz you just got served!

Ellie looks at Sebastian curiously, as Tigger comes over...

                    TIGGER
          What the hell was that, Sebastian?!
          Ellie told me you had game!

Sebastian looks at Salvo for a body language chat. Sebastian:
“Talk to Frank!” Salvo: “What am I supposed to say?”
Sebastian: “Just figure it out!” Salvo: “Vaffanculo!”

                    SALVO
          So Frank, how long have you been--
              (distracted by Doug)
          Excuse me, Doug, but what is that?

                    DOUG
          It’s an adult coloring book.

                    SALVO
          “Adult coloring book”? Those words
          don’t make no sense together.

                    FRANK
          It’s a little relaxation technique
          prescribed by our doctor to help
          him combat his stress and anxiety.

                    SALVO
          Hey I know that feeling! Stress and
          anxiety is why I spend so much time
          in the office of Dr. Budweiser.

They share a laugh, then Salvo looks back at Doug.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          What’s got your goat, kid?

                    FRANK
          For him, it’s all job-related.

                    SALVO
          Hey me too! What do you do, Doug?

                    DOUG
          Me? Oh... nothing.

                    SALVO
          Hey! You should always feel proud
          of any job, so long as you’re
          getting out there and working.
                                                         53.


Doug starts coloring more intensely.

                    FRANK
          Um, Doug actually means “nothing.”
          I’m hoping he’ll come work for the
          Hotels, but right now he’s pursuing
          a career in video games.

                    DOUG
          I’m nationally ranked in Overwatch.

                    FRANK
          And we’re all so proud.

                    SALVO
          But I thought you said he was doing
          this adult coloring to fix the
          stress and anxiety of a job?

                    FRANK
          I meant of trying to find a job.
          Which is fine! He’s only 26; plenty
          of time to figure it out.

Frank rubs Doug’s back, but Doug shakes it off petulantly.
Frank chuckles very awkwardly for a beat, then:

                    FRANK (CONT’D)
          You know what, why don’t you give
          papa one of those pages.

Douglas rips out a page for Frank, who grabs some markers.
Disgusted, Salvo looks back out at Sebastian who is changing
over courts with the others. Lucky hands Sebastian the balls.

                    LUCKY
          Three-love. We’re smoking your
          asses like a Bolognese sausage.
              (fist pump)
          Haha, yeah! Crushed him with a
          classic stereotype burn.

Ellie takes Sebastian aside, concerned about his play.

                    ELLIE
          Babe, what’s going on with you?

                    SEBASTIAN
          What do you mean?

                    ELLIE
          You love tennis and it’s like
          you’re not even trying!
                                                        54.


                    SEBASTIAN
          Who cares? It’s just a game.

                    ELLIE
          What?! At least take off that track
          suit. You must be sweating your
          tits off in there.

Ellie tries to unzip his jacket but he aggressively stops
her. She notices Sebastian staring up at his father.

                    ELLIE (CONT’D)
          Wait a sec. Are you embarrassed to
          play because your dad’s watching?

                    SEBASTIAN
          What? No!
              (then, lower)
          Okay, he’s not the biggest fan of
          sports like this and I really don’t
          feel like explaining to him that
          I’ve been paying a guy to teach me.

                    ELLIE
          Well do what you want, but you
          should know that my mom isn’t the
          biggest fan of losing. Yeah.

She points to Tigger, who is angrily using her racket to jam
an empty water cup deep into a trashcan.

                    SEBASTIAN
          At least she stopped chest bumping
          me. The only breasts I ever wanted
          to feel in your family are yours.

Ellie smiles thinly and joins Lucky on his side, as Tigger
comes over to Sebastian, showing him a photo on her phone.

                    TIGGER
          Did Ellie ever tell you about the
          guy she dated during her semester
          abroad in Scotland?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Is that Andy frickin’ Murray?!

                    TIGGER
          Never lost a match with him on my
          team. I wonder what he’s up to...

She jogs up to net, leaving Sebastian to think as he readies
to serve to Lucky, who mocks him.
                                                        55.


                    LUCKY
          Tell you what, bud! I’ll play lefty
          so this is at least a competish!

Sebastian looks from his sweet girlfriend to her smug brother
to an annoyed Tigger to a judgmental Salvo, clearly torn.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Up until then, my worst nightmare
          had been my father seeing me enjoy
          this life, but at that moment I
          realized I still had to prove I
          could be a good addition to Ellie’s
          family. So thanks to the topspin
          kick serve I’d learned from a
          Swedish pro named Johannes... this
          would be the point of no return.

Defiant, Sebastian takes a deep breath then rips off his tear-
away track suit to reveal he’s dressed in the same tiny white
tennis clothes Salvo mocked. Salvo’s jaw drops, as Sebastian
lines up to serve, picking out his wedgie like Nadal.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Buckle up, Luck. These are live.

Sebastian throws up the ball, bends his knees, and hurls his
body up into a serve, GRUNTING. It surprises Lucky, who slaps
at the ball, sending it sailing over a charging Sebastian,
who doesn’t even look back as he knows it’s out.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          Fifteen love.

                    TIGGER
          WHOO! There’s my big man!

As Sebastian fully throws himself into a powerful chest bump
with Tigger, we begin a series of shots...

--SEBASTIAN SERVES A ROCKET INTO ELLIE’S BODY, JAMMING HER.

--SEBASTIAN AND LUCKY RALLY CROSSCOURT, GRUNTING LOUDLY LIKE
A PAIR OF SHARAPOVAS. WE RACK FOCUS TO FIND SALVO WATCHING,
BEYOND DISGUSTED.

--AFTER AN INTENSE VOLLEY BATTLE AT NET, TIGGER PUTS THE BALL
AWAY. SHE AND SEBASTIAN HIGH FIVE, THEN LET THEIR HANDS SWING
ON TO SMACK EACH OTHER HARD IN THEIR RESPECTIVE ASSES. SALVO
DOES NOT ENJOY SEEING HIS SON BOND WITH ANOTHER PARENT.

--SALVO WATCHES HIS SON HITTING A SERIES OF GORGEOUS GROUND
STROKES. EVEN DOUG HAS STOPPED TO WATCH THE GLORY. AT ONE
POINT, SEBASTIAN CHASES A BALL DOWN AND HITS A “TWEENER”.
                                                        56.


                    SALVO
          Is this a game you can pickup fast?

                    FRANK
          Not this fast.

--SEBASTIAN RIPS AN OVERHEAD THAT CRASHES INTO THE PLATES OF
SOME NEARBY COUNTRY CLUB DINERS. HE POINTS TO LUCKY.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I will call you “The Concierge”,
          Luck -- cuz you just sit there while
          every one else has all the fun!
              (fist pump)
          Haha, yeah -- crushed him with a
          reality check burn!


EXT. TENNIS COURTS - LATER

The players line up for a final point. Lucky goes to serve.

                    LUCKY
          Ad-out, match point.

Lucky serves. Tigger slices the ball back and a brief rally
ensues. Lucky hits a slight lob over Sebastian’s head.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I got it, I got it!

Sebastian backpedals, jumps, and CRUSHES AN OVERHEAD. Lucky
tries to spin away, but the ball drills him in the space just
below his ass. Lucky YELPS and goes down, IN PAIN.

                    ELLIE
          Ohmigod, Lucky! Are you okay?

                    LUCKY
          No, I’m not okay! Your boyfriend
          just broke the back of my sack!

                    TIGGER
          Someone get him some ice!

Tigger scampers over the net and runs to Lucky. Everyone
circles around him as Frank trots over with ice. Doug laughs.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I’m so sorry, Luck!

                    TIGGER
          It’s okay, Sebastian. I’m sure it
          was an accident.
                                                          57.


Tigger takes Lucky into her arms, then surprises Sebastian by
flashing him a wink and a thumbs up. She turns back to Lucky.

                    TIGGER (CONT’D)
          Easy, son. We’ll go cool my future
          grandbabies down in the lake.


EXT. MARINA - LATER

As Frank, Tigger, Ellie, and Doug walk down to the boat dock,
Sebastian hangs back with a confused Salvo.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          My tennis victory should’ve been a
          proud moment for our family. But
          while most parents are happy when
          their kids win in sports, my father
          just wanted answers.

                    SALVO
          You looked like a moron. Why do the
          damn shorts have to be so tight?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Oh, come on. They’re not that bad.

                    SALVO
          “Not that bad”?! I’ve seen veal
          wrapped in twine that looks more
          relaxed than your legs.
              (pointing to his crotch)
          Seriously. I shouldn’t be able to
          tell that you’re circumcised.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Whenever you’re done with the
          insults, I’d love to know how it
          went up there with Frank.

                    SALVO
          I don’t know, son. I tried to talk
          to him, but he was too busy doing
          art projects with the world’s
          chubbiest train conductor.

Salvo gestures to Doug (still in overalls), who is busy
decapitating dandelions with a series of karate kicks.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          When in the hell did you learn to
          play tennis like that anyway?
                                                        58.


                    SEBASTIAN
          I’ve taken a few lessons. To play
          with Ellie. It’s not a big deal.

                    SALVO
          Right. And how much those cost you?

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          To the immigrant kids watching, you
          know when you get that question?
          You always give the “parent price.”

                    SEBASTIAN
          Uh, about forty bucks an hour.

                    SALVO
          Forty bucks?! You’re telling me you
          fork over the price of a long hair
          blow-out so some asshole can teach
          you how to play a kid’s game?

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Now imagine how he’d react if I told
          him the actual price was eighty.

                    SALVO
          Lemme ask you something... You sure
          you want to be a part of this family?

                    SEBASTIAN
          It’s just a hobby, Dad! Lotta
          people have them. So stop acting
          like I’m joining some kind of cult!

Salvo scoffs, not convinced, as they arrive at a large boat
dock where Tigger and Frank pass out champagne flutes.

                    FRANK
          Welcome everybody to the S.S.
          Collins! It’s so nice having you
          all with us in “White Oak.”

They all toast and take sips. Tigger and Frank are beaming.

                      TIGGER
          Now   Frank and I have been talking,
          and   we were gonna wait until the
          end   of the weekend to do this, but
          now   we’re just too excited!
                                                        59.


                    FRANK
          Sebastian? As a lifelong hotelier
          and father of the greatest girl in
          the world, I have to say it kills
          me that you’re working for my
          biggest competitor. So...

Frank looks over at Tigger, who nods eagerly.

                    TIGGER
          Yes! Go! We could use a forehand
          like his closer to us.

                    FRANK
          On behalf of the Collins Hotel
          Group, I’d love for you to join our
          side and become the new face of the
          luxurious five-star experience that
          is... “The Barrymore Hotel”?

Frank holds up “The Collins Hotel Group” portfolio, which
features a gorgeous Barrymore Hotel with a DC backdrop.
Sebastian’s mouth drops, as does Ellie and Salvo’s.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Frank, are you serious? That’s your
          signature property. And the most
          prestigious hotel in DC!

                    FRANK
              (laughing hard)
          It is! IT IS!

                    ELLIE
          Wow, guys. That’s a huge offer.

Tigger, smiling big, notices that Salvo isn’t so pleased.

                    TIGGER
          Yes. And we know this would be a
          big move for everyone, so please
          take your time, talk it over--

                    FRANK
          And tell us what day to send the
          moving trucks!

                    SEBASTIAN
          Wow. Thank you! I’m so flattered.

                    ELLIE
          Yeah, thanks Mom and Dad.
                                                        60.


                    FRANK
          Well we’d love to have our baby
          closer to home. And you too, Ellie!

Frank laughs at his joke and puts an arm around Sebastian.
Ellie and Salvo are clearly processing the development, and
Lucky is irate to see his father hugging another son-type.

                    LUCKY
              (to Sebastian)
          This is so cool! So. Cool. Hey, as
          a possible future member of our
          family company, should we celebrate
          with a little jet-booting?

                     SEBASTIAN
          Sounds great! Count me in.
              (then)
          What the hell is jet-booting?


EXT. LAKE - LATER

Out on the water, Lucky tries to teach Sebastian how to jet-
boot (look up the clip of that guy wiping out at that San
Diego pier). He hovers unsteadily trying to make it work.

                    LUCKY
          There you go, buddy! You’re up!

                    SEBASTIAN
          Wow. This is unbelievable.

                    LUCKY
          Right? Now lean very gently in the
          direction you want to go.

Lucky does that and moves. Sebastian copies him, loving it.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Haha! I feel like I’m flying!

                    LUCKY
          You are! Now come out a little
          deeper and we’ll practice turns.

They move out into the lake amidst some recreational boats.


INT. COLLINS BOAT - SAME TIME

Salvo watches them with incredulity as he struggles to stand
on the rocking boat. Tigger approaches, way more nimble.
                                                        61.


                    TIGGER
          Salvo, would you like to borrow a
          bathing suit? You look... warm.

                      SALVO
          I’m fine.

Salvo stubbornly takes a hand towel from his scissor-purse
and wipes off the profuse sweat gathering on his face.

                    TIGGER
          Hey, I just wanted to thank you for
          looking after Ellie in Chicago. We
          feel so lucky she’s met your son.
          You did a great job raising him.

                    SALVO
          Yeah. He’s a good kid.

They look out where Lucky is teaching Sebastian how to dive.

                    LUCKY
          Now just lean forward, then throw
          yourself headfirst into the water.

Lucky does this and pops back up, then Sebastian prepares to
try. It’s not as easy for him and he looks kinda dumb.

                    SALVO
          ...when he’s not making an ass of
          himself.

They share a chuckle.

                    TIGGER
          And I know you guys are close so if
          they end up coming to DC, I promise
          we’ll take good care of him. We’ll
          help them find a house, they can
          join our clubs, use our tickets to
          all the sports teams -- plus, we’ll
          be retiring soon so if they ever
          kids, BOOM! Free babysitters.

                     SALVO
          Ha! My retirement plan is to work
          until I drop dead, while still
          trying to style the hair of the EMT
          who’s fighting to revive me.
              (then)
          But honestly I wouldn’t get your
          hopes up. I can’t imagine Sebastian
          ever leaving Chicago, or me. I’m
          the only family he’s got.
                                                         62.


                    TIGGER
          I used to say the same thing about
          Ellie. But then she fell in love
          and ended up living happily without
          me in a totally different city.

Tigger gestures to Ellie, who’s yelling support to Sebastian.

                    TIGGER (CONT’D)
          I know how hard it can be, so just
          know we’d be happy to fly you down
          anytime to visit. We’ll do whatever
          it takes to make Sebastian feel
          like he’s at home with our family.

Tigger pats Salvo on the back. As the reality of this lands
with him, he turns to watch his son executing some dives.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Check it out, pops! I can dive!

Sebastian finds his balance then dives, and executes the move
fairly well, and pops back up!

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          Oh my god, this is incredible!

                    ELLIE
          Whoo! Nice one, babe!

Sebastian does another one, gaining confidence. Salvo
watches, realizing -- maybe this is the place for him.

                    SEBASTIAN
          What do you think, Dad? Should I
          become the first Italian Aquabat?!

Sebastian does another dive and comes up, happy. Everyone on
the boat -- including Salvo -- GASPS. Lucky starts laughing.

                    TIGGER / ELLIE.
          Oh my god. / Oh shit.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Not bad, huh?

                    ELLIE
          Sebastian! Your suit!

                    SEBASTIAN
          It’s Gucci. Why, you like it?

                    SALVO
          No, you moron! It’s not... up!
                                                        63.


Sebastian looks down and, we reveal that that force of the
water has ripped Sebastian’s suit down to his ankles.

                    ELLIE
          The water must’ve ripped it off!

                       SEBASTIAN
          Oh my god!

                    SALVO / ELLIE
          Pull it back up! / Sebastian!

                    SEBASTIAN
          I’m trying, but I can’t--

Sebastian tries to bend down to grab it, but every movement
he makes causes the jet boots to propel him in a weird way.
As he struggles, he can’t stop twisting and turning and
crashing into the water, all the time fully showing his full
(unseen to us) penis to the family and other boaters.

                    DOUG
          Hey Sebastian! Your penis is showing!

                    SEBASTIAN
          Yeah I realize that, Doug!

Sebastian keeps trying to pull up his suit, but only does
more dives, splashes, and at one point hits the boat, his
bare ass slowly smearing its way up a boat window.

As Sebastian panics, Lucky laughs his ass off and films with
his phone. Ellie yells at Lucky to help him. Everyone else
yells to try and help. This goes on and on, until we...


INT. SEBASTIAN AND SALVO'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Sebastian exits from the bathroom with his toothbrush, to
find Salvo packing up his suitcase.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Dad? What the hell are you doing?

                    SALVO
          Packing. It’s time for us to go
          back home to Chicago.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Are you crazy?! We’re not leaving.
          You haven’t given me the ring yet.
                                      64.


          SALVO
Trust me. What I saw today? You
don’t come back from that.

          SEBASTIAN
Stop bring so dramatic. I was far
away. No one saw that much.

          SALVO
That’s for damn sure! Look, I know
I haven’t really seen you naked
since the delivery room, but is it
possible that your ding-a-ling
hasn’t grown since then?

          SEBASTIAN
Come on, that lake water is cold!
Now put the damn suitcase away.

          SALVO
Nope. I’m gonna bring you home, set
you up on a couple dates with some
nice Italian girls, help you start
over fresh. I’ve already got a new
hairstyle picked out for you.

          SEBASTIAN
You kidding me right now? Dad, I’m
in love with Ellie. That wouldn’t
change if I accidentally showed my
balls to the entire world.

          SALVO
Oh, is that what you have planned
for tomorrow? I’m sorry Sebastian,
but you need to stop pretending
that you fit in with these people.

          SEBASTIAN
Guy, I’m not pretending!

          SALVO
Please! With the helicopter and the
jetboots and those weird chest
bumps you keep doing with Tigger --
it’s embarrassing!

          SEBASTIAN
Maybe, but I got news for you, Dad.
I love the stuff I do with Ellie!

          SALVO
You can’t be serious right now.
You’re making an ass of yourself!
                                                        65.


                    SEBASTIAN
          Only because you raised me to be
          afraid of ever trying anything new!
          And honestly, I was nervous to
          bring you here ‘cause I knew you’d
          just sit here judging me, with your
          black clothes and the scissor purse
          and your resting bitch face.

                    SALVO
          I don’t have resting bitch face!

                    SEBASTIAN
          We all have resting bitch face!

Salvo and Sebastian square off with dueling “bitch faces”.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          Your problem is you’re so damn
          negative, you don’t let yourself
          enjoy anything, and so you think I
          can’t either. But my future is with
          Ellie, so I’m gonna keep trying to
          have open mind! ABOUT EVERYTHING!

                    SALVO
          COME ON! EVEN THE JOB OFFER?

                    SEBASTIAN
          MAYBE! IT’S A PRETTY GOOD ONE!

                    SALVO
          UNBELIEVABLE! FIRST, YOUR MOTHER IS
          TAKEN FROM ME! NOW YOU WANNA LEAVE!
          WHY’S EVERYONE GOTTA ABANDON ME?!

                    SEBASTIAN
          I’M NOT ABANDONING YOU, DAD! IT’S
          JUST, ELLIE IS THE BEST THING THAT
          EVER HAPPENED TO ME AND WHEN I
          MARRY HER -- NOT IF -- HER FAMILY’S
          GONNA BE A BIG PART OF THE PACKAGE!
          SO YOU NEED TO START MAKING AN
          EFFORT HERE, YOU KNOW? BE THE
          CHARMING GUY PEOPLE SEE EVERY DAY
          IN YOUR SALON OR YOU’LL GIVE ME NO
          CHOICE BUT TO LEAVE YOU BEHIND!

                    SALVO
          VAFFANCULO, WITH THE ULTIMATUMS!
          YOU’VE NO RESPECT FOR OUR FAMILY!
                                                           66.


                    SEBASTIAN
          I GOT ENOUGH RESPECT TO KNOW WE’RE
          ALLOWED TO GO BED ANGRY... BUT NOT
          STINKY. SO QUIT YOUR BITCHIN’ FOR A
          SECOND AND GET OVER HERE FOR A
          SPRAY!

Sebastian grabs his night cologne. A beat, then Salvo
begrudgingly grabs his. As they both spray, then dramatically
jump through mist, full of unresolved tension, we...


EXT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Salvo walks outside, inhaling a Jewel Cigar in the cool night
air, looking up at the stars. He blows out a long hit.

                    SALVO
          ...and you should taste the food
          here. It’s just like the people --
          cold, white, and dry. Amore, I wish
          you were here for so many reasons.
          Number one, to show these uppity
          snobs how to make a sauce. I mean,
          their bread tastes like a cardboard
          box. And I feel like I got paper
          cuts up and down my throat. But
          more to tell me if I’m being an
          asshole. Is this really the life we
          want for our son? I could really
          use a sign... Anything to let me
          know what you think about all this?

Salvo looks around the sky for any message from his late
wife. Finally, a gentle wind starts blowing. The leaves in
the trees start to rustle. There’s a scratching in a nearby
bush. Salvo smiles, bracing for an answer, then...

BRAAAAAAACCCCHHH!

Sgt. Feathers and his family of peacocks bursts from the
bushes, scaring the shit of Salvo, as they waddle past.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          Stupid peacocks! Bunch of goddamn
          showoffs if you ask me!

As Salvo flicks his burning cigar after them, still unsure
what to do, the music kicks back up as we fade into the next
part of the journey...
            67.




“SECONDI”

INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING

Sebastian enters to find Frank and Lucky eating breakfast.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          After our fight, I woke up nervous.
          That was the first time I’d yelled
          at my father like that and I was
          scared to see how he’d respond.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Hey, good morning, gents.

                    FRANK
          Heyyy! There he is.

Lucky gets up and introduces himself.

                    LUCKY
          Hey man, how ya doing? I’m Lucky.

                    SEBASTIAN
          What? Lucky, it’s me. Sebastian.

                    LUCKY
          Oh, right. You look so different
          without your crotch on display.

                    FRANK
          Ignore him. How’d you sleep, buddy?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Not bad. Have you seen my dad?

                    FRANK
          I think he’s still out on a walk
          with Ellie, Doug, and Tigger.

Sebastian laughs, then stops when he sees Frank is serious.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Wait, for real?

                    FRANK
          Yeah, they should be back any
          minute. Sit down and eat.

Sebastian looks outside the house and sees a whole new Salvo
power-walking toward them with the others. He’s now dressed
in vacation wear -- shorts, flip-flops, and a Polo shirt with
the giant logo -- as he holds the leash strapped to Duke.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Holy mother of God...
                                                        69.


Sebastian opens the door to meet them. Salvo is mid-story.

                    SALVO
          ...so I says to him, I say, “Why
          would I buy you a skateboard, when
          I can build you one instead!”

They all laugh hard as they enter the house. Sebastian takes
in the marvel that is Salvo in vacation-mode.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          Hey there, sleepy-head! I was just
          telling them about the time I gave
          you a skateboard for Christmas.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Let me guess -- you skipped the
          part where the wheels locked up and
          I had to have skin from my ass
          grafted onto my face?

Salvo reaches over and rubs Sebastian’s cheek affectionately.

                    SALVO
          That’s how it stays so smooth!

                    SEBASTIAN
          When did you get up anyway?

                    SALVO
          Early! But I didn’t want to wake
          you, so I snuck out, watched some
          news, did my laundry, fixed the
          bannister, reorganized the spice
          rack... and then the sun came up,
          so I started cooking breakfast. And
          then I went for a walk so I could
          get to know the family. Good people
          these Collins. Even the weird one.

Doug stops chewing a cinnamon roll to wonder if that’s about
him. Still processing, Sebastian takes in his “new dad”.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          What’s the matter? I’m just trying
          to make an effort.

                    SEBASTIAN
          And I appreciate that. It’s just...
          the shorts.

                    SALVO
          What about ‘em?
                                                        70.


                    SEBASTIAN
          You’re wearing them. I don’t think
          I’ve ever seen your legs before.

                    SALVO
          Oh yeah, they’re a little pale.

                    SEBASTIAN
          And so many veins. I can’t tell if
          those are your legs or the map your
          platoon used to find Ho Chi Minh.

                    SALVO
          All I know is, I feel great, it’s a
          sunny day, and Frank, I’d love to
          make you guys a proper Italian
          dinner tonight. As a thank you for
          letting us stay at your place.

                    FRANK
          Oh, Salvo. That’s not necessary. We
          don’t keep a lot of food here and
          the market’s closed for the holiday.

                    SALVO
          Don’t worry -- a Maniscalco always
          finds a way to feed his family.

                    FRANK
          Well, alright then. That would be
          lovely. Thank you, Salvo!

                    SALVO
          My pleasure! Now you kids go have
          fun, play your tennis, sail your
          boats, do whatever you need to do
          to work up an appetite for the best
          meal of your lives.

Salvo gives Sebastian a look “See, I’m trying.”

                    DOUG
          Just know I don’t eat pork.

                    SALVO
          Don’t worry, kid.
              (re: Sebastian)
          I think we’ve all had our fill of
          sausage for the weekend.

Salvo gestures to Sebastian with his thumb, and everyone but
Sebastian does a hard country club laugh together.
                                                        71.


INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Sebastian, Salvo, and the Collins enjoy a delicious meal.
They’re making pleasure noises like intense flav-or-gasms.

                    FRANK
          Salvo, this is delicious. I can’t
          believe you put this all together
          with what we had in the house.

                    SALVO
          I told you I could make it happen!

                    SEBASTIAN
          My guess is he raided the kitchen
          at “The Shack”. You might wanna ask
          Gloria to check the inventory.

Salvo loudly shushes Sebastian. Everyone laughs.

                    TIGGER
          What do you call this dish? It
          tastes like gourmet chicken parm.

                    SALVO
          It’s called: “Carciofi y pavone.”

                    TIGGER / FRANK
              (loving it)
          Carciofi y pavone.

                    LUCKY
          It’s genuinely good. If I wasn’t
          balls deep in this Keto diet, I’d
          totally be swallowing these bites.

Lucky finishes chewing, then spits his food into the trash.

                    SALVO
          It’s the least I could do, given
          all you’re offering my son.
              (raises his glass)
          La famiglia non è una cosa
          importante. È tutto.
              (then, translating)
          Family isn’t just one important
          thing; it’s everything.

                    FRANK
          Here, here!

As they clink and drink, even Sebastian has to admit it’s a
nice moment. He then notices that the bottle is empty.
                                                        72.


                    SEBASTIAN
          I’ll grab some more vino.

                    FRANK
          When in Rome! You know, because you
          guys are Italian.

He laughs and even Salvo joins in. As Sebastian heads out, he
gives a “thank you” sign to Salvo, who winks back.


INT. GARAGE - MINUTES LATER

Sebastian pulls out a bottle of wine and as he turns, he gets
pinned against the wall and kissed by an excited Ellie.

                    ELLIE
          Let’s run away together!

                       SEBASTIAN
          What, now?

                    ELLIE
          Yeah! Let’s move to Maine and open
          a bed-and-breakfast. You could run
          it, I’ll build a studio, and in
          between we could work on populating
          the world with happier Maniscalcos.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I definitely like the lots of sex
          part but where’s this is coming
          from? It’s going so well in there.
          Like, our families are actually
          getting along.

                    ELLIE
          I know! And that makes me think
          something must be wrong.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Heyyyy. Look at you, acting all
          paranoid like a mini-Maniscalco.
              (Ellie laughs)
          And normally I’d be with you on this,
          but I think you’re just weirded out
          ‘cause my dad’s acting all nice.

                    ELLIE
          Oh my god, I think you’re right.
          This honestly might be the first
          time I’ve ever seen him smile.
                                                           73.


                    SEBASTIAN
          It’s very off-putting! He looks
          like someone’s pulling his mouth
          back with two fish hooks.

Sebastian imitates what his dad looks like. Ellie laughs.

                    ELLIE
          Yeah, he’s clearly never used those
          muscles before. Like the corners of
          his mouth just woke up from a coma.

                    SEBASTIAN
          So, yes, I do want to run away with
          you, but I also kinda want to enjoy
          this good mood while it lasts.

                    ELLIE
          Okay, that’s fair. Our B&B was
          probably haunted anyway.
              (then, flirty)
          But speaking of good things that
          don’t last very long...

Ellie puts her hands on Sebastian’s waist and raises her
eyebrows suggestively. Sebastian laughs, into it.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Here? This garage is pretty echo-y
          and you know I’m a screamer.

Ellie laughs. They start to make out, but as they step back,
Ellie accidentally knocks the lids off some trashcans. Behind
her, Sebastian squints as he sees what looks like two eyes
staring back at him. He looks closer and sees it’s actually:

FUCKING PEACOCK FEATHERS!

...sticking out from the top of the trash can. His eyes go
wide and he starts to panic as he realizes...

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          Pavone.

                    ELLIE
          What, is it on my breath?

Sebastian’s world starts to close in on him as he processes
what his father has done, while simultaneously trying to keep
Ellie from also making this discovery.

                    ELLIE (CONT’D)
          Babe? What’s wrong with you?
                                                        74.


Ellie starts to turn, but Sebastian keeps her facing forward
as he stages a hug to grab the trashcan lid and replace it.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Nothing! I just... don’t want this
          wine to get more room temp. We
          better go back inside.

Sebastian grabs the wine and pulls her away.

                    ELLIE
          Aw. Right when you got me all
          excited for garage sex.


INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - DINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Sebastian returns with Ellie to see everyone getting along
famously. The world moves in slow motion for Sebastian, as
everyone takes HUGE BITES and feasts on Sgt. Feathers.

They obliviously chew the peacock, toasting their glasses and
repeating the name of the dish in Italian accents.

                    FRANK
          Carciofi y pavone!

                    TIGGER
          Carciofi y Pavone!

                    LUCKY / DOUG
          Pavone! / Pavone!

As Salvo smiles broadly at a still spiraling Sebastian, we...


INT. THE WOODS - TWO A.M.

Sebastian pushes Salvo into the woods, carrying a bag of what
we can presume is the peacock carcass, and two shovels. They
repeatedly slap mosquitos and bugs that are biting them.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I can’t believe you fed them a
          peacock!!! How could you do this?!

                    SALVO
          Easy. My recipe called for chicken,
          the store was closed, so like any
          great chef I improvised.

                    SEBASTIAN
          By murdering their beloved mascot?!
                                                        75.


                    SALVO
          They still got three left! And I
          don’t see the big deal. You eat
          chicken, don’t you? And turkey and
          duck and other birds?

                       SEBASTIAN
          Of course!

                    SALVO
          Well a peacock is just a chicken with
          a fancy coat on. What, we’re supposed
          to have more respect for a bird
          because it dresses like Elton John?

                    SEBASTIAN
          You’re a goddamn monster!

                    SALVO
          No, I’m a survivor! Where we come
          from, you do whatever you need to
          keep the family fed! It’s called
          the peasant mentality.

                    SEBASTIAN
          This ain’t where you came from and
          these ain’t peasants! So just shut
          up and help me dig!

Sebastian tosses a shovel to Salvo. They both start digging,
as Sebastian slaps at the large mosquitos on his neck.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          Man, these bugs are all over me.

                    SALVO
          It’s our cologne. They can’t resist
          it. These country mosquitos got a
          lot in common with girls on the
          beaches of Palermo.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Pfft. And you said I was “ingrato”
          for worrying you might make us look
          like some bad Italian stereotype.

                    SALVO
          Pfft yourself. I’m not doing that!

                    SEBASTIAN
          Are you blind? We’re literally out
          in the woods, in the middle of the
          night, trying to get rid of a
          fuckin’ body!
                                                          76.


                    SALVO
          Okay, I’ll admit this does have a
          bit of a Casino vibe. But I was
          just trying to help you win the
          family over with an amazing meal!

                    SEBASTIAN
          If this is your idea of help, I
          think I’m good from now on!

                    SALVO
          Hey, what happened to “making an
          effort here”? If you did it, you’d
          see this as a fun bonding moment.
              (warmly)
          Kinda reminds me of when we used to
          dig snow together in our driveway.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Dad, we aren’t bonding! We’re
          getting rid of evidence!
              (then, freaking)
          If Ellie’s family finds out about
          this, they’re gonna kill us.

                    SALVO
          Nah. Whether they like it or not,
          they’re a part of this now.

As an exasperated Sebastian goes back to digging, we...


INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY

Tired and covered in bug bites, Sebastian enters with Salvo.
They find Frank standing at the island, eating from a plate.

                    FRANK
          Morning, gentlemen! Hey, thanks
          again for dinner last night.
              (takes another bite)
          Mmm. This is one of those dishes
          that’s even better as leftovers.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Please put down the plate, Frank!
              (takes a deep breath)
          We have to tell you something.

                    SALVO
          No, we don’t.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Yes, we do.
                                                        77.


Frank puts down the plate, concerned.

                    FRANK
          Whoa! Look at all those bug bites!
          Is the screen in your room broken?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Well it’s a funny story. Hopefully.
          See, last night, my father, he...

Ellie runs in, looking concerned.

                    ELLIE
          Sebastian, there you are! My mom
          needs to talk to your dad!

                    SEBASTIAN
          Is this about the bird? I swear we
          were about to tell you guys.

                    ELLIE
          What? No. MSNBC just called her to
          do an interview and she has no one
          to do her hair and make-up.
              (to Salvo)
          Can you help her get ready?

                     SALVO
          Ha! That’s like asking Van Gogh if
          he can draw a smiley face.
              (then)
          But Sebastian, are you sure it’s
          okay if I try to help?

As everyone turns to Sebastian for an answer, we...


INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - LIBRARY - TWO HOURS LATER

Salvo finishes styling Tigger, then spins her around in a
chair to face the mirror. Her hair has been straightened,
trimmed, and slicked back into a tight boyish ponytail.

She studies the cut and can’t quite make sense of it. Neither
can Ellie, Sebastian, or Frank. Only Salvo looks proud.

                    SALVO
          So what do you think, Tig?

                    TIGGER
          Well, for starters, this isn’t at
          all what I asked you to do!
                                                        78.


                    SALVO
          Yeah, I don’t really do requests.
          The way I work is I look at your
          face and get a sense of your aura,
          then let that dictate the style
          your personality demands.

                    TIGGER
          I’m about to go on TV! I just want
          to look like myself! Oh my god!
              (fusses with her hair)
          Frank, do I look horrible?

                    FRANK
          Well no, it’s not horrible. It’s...
              (bailing)
          Ellie?

                    ELLIE
          No! I’m still trying to figure
          out... exactly... what it is.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Dad, can’t you just ditch the aura
          crap and do what she wants?

                    SALVO
          Son, that’s like asking Caravaggio
          to go back in and touch up “The
          Beheading of Holofernes.” When it’s
          done it’s done!

                    SEBASTIAN
          That what of who?

                    TIGGER
          Oh my god. Okay. It’s just one
          appearance. I guess it’ll be--

Lucky barges in, looking at his phone...

                    LUCKY
          Anyone want to see a slo-mo vid of
          Sebastians’s floppy...

Lucky stops when he sees Tigger and starts laughing.

                    LUCKY (CONT’D)
          Holy shit, Mom! Why do you have the
          same exact haircut as Salvo?

Everyone turns to look at Tigger and Salvo in the mirror and
realizes for the first time that Salvo has indeed given her
an almost identical female version of his slicked ponytail.
                                                        79.


                    ELLIE / FRANK / SEBASTIAN
          I see it now. / Yup. / Jesus, Dad!

                    LUCKY
          You look like those weird boy girl
          twins who dress up like each other.

                    TIGGER
          Salvo! How could you do this to me?

                    SALVO
          I mean, I didn’t realize I was
          doing it, but even now I gotta
          say... you look incredible!

                    TIGGER
          What?! In ten minutes, I’m supposed
          to go on TV to discuss the crisis
          in Israel and you’ve made me look
          like a bitter old Italian man!

Salvo shrugs. Tigger closes her eyes, eerily calm.

                    TIGGER (CONT’D)
          Everybody please get out.

                    ELLIE
          Mom, maybe we can--

                    TIGGER
          OUT! DO YOU HEAR ME? GET! OUT!

Everybody starts to file out... except Salvo, who lingers.

                    TIGGER (CONT’D)
          What?! What do you want?!

                    SALVO
          I don’t mean to be a stickler, but
          after I provide a style to someone
          it’s customary to offer me a--

                    TIGGER
          I’M NOT GIVING YOU A STUPID TIP!


INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - KITCHEN - LATER

Sebastian and Salvo watch “ALL IN WITH CHRIS HAYES” on live
TV as Tigger gives a very heated talking head interview.
                                                  80.


                    TIGGER (ON TV)
          All due respect, Chris, but the
          existing policy has been working
          for two decades! Why change now?!

                    SALVO
          Damn she’s really kicking some ass.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Yeah, because she’s pretty much
          talking to you!

                    CHRIS HAYES (ON TV)
          But sometimes change is necessary.

                    TIGGER (ON TV)
          You don’t just make MAJOR decisions
          based on INSTINCT! You gotta LISTEN
          to people you’re servicing, or
          someone’s gonna end up DEAD!

                    SALVO
          Yeah, okay, maybe a little.

Sebastian lowers the volume and turns to Salvo.

                    SEBASTIAN
          As soon as this is over, you need
          to go apologize to her.

                    SALVO
          “Apologize”?! For what?

                    SEBASTIAN
          She asked you for a touch up and
          you made her look like Dom DeLuise!

                    SALVO
          That style gives her a dignity
          that’s more age-appropriate. If
          anything she should be thanking me!

Ellie enters, hearing this.

                    ELLIE
          I wouldn’t hold your breath.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Is she really that hacked off?

                    ELLIE
          She keeps saying you guys will
          settle this on the paintball field,
          so I think maybe a little?
                                                        81.


                    SALVO
          Most women consider it an honor to
          get their hair cut by East Chicago’s
          three time stylist-of-the-year.

                    SEBASTIAN
          That was back in the Eighties, Dad.

                    SALVO
          Which was the golden age of hair!

Salvo throws up his hands in frustration and exits as
Sebastian turns back to Ellie.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I’m really sorry, babe.

                    ELLIE
          Whatever, it’s just hair. It’s not
          like he killed a pet or something.

As Ellie reaches for a nibble from Frank’s plate, Sebastian
grabs it and dumps it in the trash.

We then overlap LOUD REVOLUTION-ERA “FIFE & DRUM” MUSIC...


EXT. THE WHITE OAKS GROUNDS - THAT AFTERNOON

...as we come up on Frank marching in an authentic Continental
Army Captain’s uniform. The music goes quiet and tinny as we
reveal Doug ambling ahead of him, playing it from a small
bluetooth speaker. Frank stops at a stockade of paintball
weaponry, where our family members and other CLUB MEMBERS are
drawing red or blue notecards from a vintage tricorn hat.

                    FRANK
          Welcome everybody to the ninth
          annual “White Oak Paintball
          American Revolution”!

People whoop and holler in support.

                    FRANK (CONT’D)
          Now if you’ve drawn a red card, you
          will be representing the Bastardly
          British Forces. Booooo!
              (chuckling)
          And if you have blue, you’ll fight
          with me for the Continental Army,
          represented by this actual uniform
          worn by my forefather Captain Frank
          Collins the Sixth, whose blood has
          soaked into this very collar.
                                                        82.


                    DOUG
          He cut himself shaving!

                    FRANK
          DAMMIT, DOUGLAS! THE MAN WAS STILL
          INJURED ON THE BATTLEFIELD!
              (gathering himself)
          Okay, Lucky. Be a sport and take us
          through the rules.

Lucky steps forward, holding up his paintball gun.

                    LUCKY
          Alright folks, it’s pretty simple.
          Everyone gets a gun and a mask,
          which should be worn at all times.
          Red will fight blue. One hit means
          you’re injured...

Lucky fires at Sebastian, who recoils from the pain.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Ow!

                    LUCKY
          Two means you’re dead.

Lucky fires two more bullets into Sebastian’s butt cheeks.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Dude! Ugh! Come on already!

                    LUCKY
          When we’re not fighting, always
          keep your safeties on by making
          sure this switch is set to black.
          Can you handle that, Sea Bass?

Sebastian sets his safety to black, then pulls the trigger to
check it and fires a bullet straight into the underside of
his chin, sending him flailing backwards. Salvo immediately
pulls his gun on Lucky!

                    SALVO
          Stop messing with my son, you son
          of a bitch!

                    TIGGER
          Who you calling a bitch, bitch!

Tigger pulls a gun on Salvo, causing several others to pull
guns on each other! It looks like a lowest possible stakes
version of the end to a Quintin Tarrantino movie.
                                                           83.


                    ELLIE
          Whoa, whoa! Everybody calm down.

Everybody stands down with their weapons, as Lucky laughs.

                    LUCKY
          Most important rule of all: never
          trust your enemies! The safety is
          on when the switch is set to red.
          Now, the team with the last man
          standing wins the war. Good luck!

Everyone gears up. Team Blue includes Frank, Tigger, and
Lucky. Salvo, Sebastian, Doug and Ellie are on Team Red.

                    ELLIE
          Alright boys, we ready for this?

                    SEBASTIAN
          I’m feeling okay for a guy who’s
          already been shot four times.
          Everything good with you, Dad?

Salvo looks over at Tigger, who stops prepping her gear to
smile and make an “I’m gonna cut your throat” sign to him.

                    SALVO
          They ain’t gonna know what hit ‘em.

As Salvo smears eye black under his eyes, we...


EXT. THE WHITE OAKS GROUNDS - LATER

Sebastian trots through the woods with Ellie trailing.

                    SEBASTIAN
          So what should we do -- camp out or
          stay on the run?

                    ELLIE
          Um... how about we do this?

Ellie shoots him twice in the stomach.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Jesus! Is there anyone in your
          family who doesn’t want to shoot
          me?

                    ELLIE
          In our defense, the fourth time you
          shot yourself. But don’t worry...
                                                          84.


Ellie turns the gun and shoots herself twice in the stomach.

                    SEBASTIAN
          What the hell, Ell? We’re trying to
          win a war and now we’re both dead!

                    ELLIE
          Do you really want to keep playing
          this kid’s game? Or should we go
          have sex in my childhood fort...

                     SEBASTIAN
              (beat)
          Why are we just standing here? You
          still haven’t shown me your
          childhood fort!

As they laugh and head off, we...


EXT. THE WHITE OAKS GROUNDS - SAME TIME

Salvo and Doug sneak through another part of the woods,
sniping soldiers from the BLUE TEAM as they go.

                    DOUG
          Rebels on your left!

Salvo whips around as they snipe two guys twice in the chest.

                    SALVO
          Nice shot, kid.

                    DOUG
          Thanks, Salvo. You too.

They trot on, using military signs as they go.

                    DOUG (CONT’D)
          I saw you made my mom look like an
          Sicilian cab driver. S’up with that?

                    SALVO
          Pretty sure you’re not allowed to
          criticize other people’s work
          unless you’ve got a job yourself.

                    DOUG
          You don’t think I want a job?

                    SALVO
          No I don’t. Cover me!

Doug provides cover as Salvo ducks and snipes a BLUE TEAMER.
                                                        85.


                    DOUG
          I do want to work. It’s just, my
          dad wants me to come to the hotel
          company but I want to do something
          more in line with my skills.

                    SALVO
          And what are those -- masturbating
          all winter while your parents pay
          your phone bill?

                    DOUG
          That’s not all I do here! I mean,
          obviously it happens. But only at
          the beginning of the month when the
          new catalogues get delivered...

                    SALVO
          Right, no Internet. ON YOUR RIGHT!

Doug drops to a knee and Salvo shoots a BLUE TEAMER over him.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          You think my dad wanted me to be a
          hair stylist? No way. But growing
          up, I looked at him and thought --
          why am I gonna bust my back laying
          bricks when I could make twice as
          much hanging out with a buncha hot
          broads in an air-conditioned salon.

                    DOUG
          I can’t just piss off my parents.
          They’ll drop me from the payroll.

                    SALVO
          And that’s the problem. You act
          like a little kid, so they treat
          you like one. But at some point you
          gotta man up and do something.

                    DOUG
          I don’t act like a little kid!

                    SALVO
          Yes you do!

                    DOUG
          DO NOT!

                    SALVO
          DO TOO! And to be honest? If you
          were my son, I’d spank that bad
          attitude right out of you.
                                                           86.


Doug stares at Salvo like he’s going to say something tough,
then starts looking like he’s going to cry and runs away.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          Oh for the love of God! Are you
          seriously running away?
              (calls after him)
          Wait! At least slow down! You’re
          gonna get a cramp!

Frank and Lucky catch their breath behind a log.

                    FRANK
          Okay... I think we lost them.

                    LUCKY
          Lemme check.

Lucky takes off his hat and raises it over the log. It’s
immediately pelted by a stream of paintballs.

                    LUCKY (CONT’D)
          Shit, Dad! We’re trapped!

                    FRANK
          Don’t worry, Son. In moments like
          these, I like to ask myself -- what
          would our ancestors do?

                    LUCKY
              (thinks, then)
          Call our friends at the Embassy and
          see if they can bail us out?

                    FRANK
          I mean the older ones, who actually
          fought in wars. They would suck it
          up and face our enemies head on!

                    LUCKY
          Got it. Dad, have you ever, I dunno,
          thought about ignoring our ancestors
          and carving your own path?

                    FRANK
          Not once, Son. I know the American
          dream is all about rolling up your
          sleeves and getting dirty, but tell
          me something...
                    (MORE)

                    FRANK (CONT'D)
          When you’re walking in the woods,
          would you rather tear through the
          uncut brush or do you prefer to
          follow the footsteps of those
          who’ve walked there before you?

Lucky smiles, understanding.

                    FRANK (CONT’D)
          Be grateful for the path, son.
          Because a lot of people aren’t
          lucky enough to have one.

                    LUCKY
          Let’s make our ancestors proud and
          lay waste to these sons of bitches!

Frank and Lucky share a look, then   scream and rise   up to kick
ass... then immediately get lit up   by Salvo who is   coming out
at them with two weapons like John   Wick. Frank and   Lucky look
at their bodies, covered in paint,   then each other   and shrug.

                    FRANK
          Or we could go have a scotch.


INT. ELLIE’S CHILDHOOD FORT - SAME TIME

Sebastian rolls off Ellie. Both are happy and breathing hard.

                    ELLIE
          Wow. That was... splintery.

                    SEBASTIAN
          I’m just glad the mouse left. Guy
          wouldn’t stop staring me in the eyes.

Ellie laughs and cuddles up next to Sebastian.

                    ELLIE
          Babe, I’m sorry I was acting all
          crazy yesterday.

                    SEBASTIAN
          You mean after I got offered the
          chance to run the nicest hotel in
          America and your first instinct was
          to run away to Maine?

                    ELLIE
          Yeah. It’s just my parents, you
          know? Sometimes they like to wrap
          their hands around us kids and just
          squeeze until we can’t move.
                                                           88.


                    SEBASTIAN
          Now you’re complaining about having
          a family that hugs too tight?

                    ELLIE
          My point is, life could be really
          good for us in DC. So if you want
          to move there, I say we do it.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Thanks, Ell. I can’t imagine ever
          leaving my Dad, but... maybe it is
          time to try something new.

                    ELLIE
          Well, he does seem to be making
          more of an effort. Maybe our
          parents will all end up friends and
          he’ll end up moving with us?

                    SEBASTIAN
              (high-pitched)
          Yeah. Maybe.


EXT. THE WHITE OAKS GROUNDS - SAME TIME

Tigger, in full battle mode, charges through the woods
sniping RED TEAMERS as she goes with surprising expertise.

                    TIGGER
          Sallllvoooo! You can run, but you
          can’t hide... your cologne.

Tigger sniffs the air and finds a jacket poking out from
behind a tree. She jumps around the corner and fires...

                    TIGGER (CONT’D)
          Got ya, sucker!

...but the bullet hits an empty jacket he’s propped up.

As Tigger inspects it, annoyed, the leafy ledge behind her
comes to life as Salvo emerges from amidst them, rocking a
homemade Ghillie suit he’s put together with moss and leaves.

His gun emerges as Salvo takes aim, but Tigger senses the
activity and ducks just as he fires. The paintball splatters
against the tree as Tigger rolls around and fires back...
just as Salvo also jumps to safety behind a tree.

                    TIGGER (CONT’D)
          I’m gonna kill you, buddy!
                                                        89.


                    SALVO
          Not if I kill you first!

Salvo runs to a new hiding spot as Tigger fires at him. Salvo
keeps popping up from different places to fire back. They
call to each other during the fight.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          Tell me something -- where’d a girl
          like you learn to fight like this?

                    TIGGER
          Well, I grew up stag hunting with
          my father in Scotland!

She jumps out and fires! He fires back!

                    TIGGER (CONT’D)
          Then I captained the biathlon team
          at my boarding school!

She fires again! He fires back!

                    TIGGER (CONT’D)
          But I probably learned most of this
          from my stint in... THE NAVY!

Tigger runs across the woods, emptying a clip on the way.
Salvo tries to hit her the whole way. Then silence.

                    SALVO
          Wiat, you’re military? I thought
          you went to Princeton.

                    TIGGER
          I enlisted after graduation because
          I felt I owed it to our country.
          But mostly to piss off my parents.

                    SALVO
          Well then... HAPPY FOURTH TO YOU!

Salvo jumps out and fires just as she does the same. They
both have a perfect shot, but in slo-mo we see their two
bullets collide and EXPLODE in a splash of blue and red.

It’s amazing. They both look at each other, then can’t help
but smile. It’s a fun moment. Maybe in another life...

                    TIGGER
          To you as well, sir.

They salute each other, then instantly fall back into fight
mode, chasing each other through the woods, as we...
                                                        90.


EXT. THE WHITE OAKS GROUNDS - LATER

Back at the starting place, the “killed” RED and BLUE TEAMERS
sip lemonade and talk about the battle. Lucky and Frank drink
scotch as Sebastian and Ellie watch the field.

                    ELLIE
          There they are! I see them.

Ellie points to Salvo and Tigger approaching from afar, both
gesticulating wildly.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Ah crap, they’re fighting. Wait,
          are they fighting?

                    ELLIE
          I honestly can’t tell. The line
          between good moods and bad moods is
          so thin for both of them.

ANGLE ON TIGGER AND SALVO: They’re both dirty and covered in
paint splotches and definitely in good moods.

                    SALVO
          Damn, Tigger. That was one hell of
          a fight.

                    TIGGER
          I’ll say. I’ve never seen an old
          man scramble up a tree like that.
          You sure you’re not half raccoon?

                    SALVO
          Ha! Where were you when I was
          planting bombs on North Korean
          radio towers? You’re twice the man
          of any soldier in my platoon.

                    TIGGER
          Yeah, I get that a lot.

They laugh, then Salvo softens a bit.

                    SALVO
          Hey Tig, I just want to say... I’m
          sorry. For giving you such a high
          quality style, without permission.

                    TIGGER
          That’s nice of you to say. Even if
          your apologies sound more like
          compliments to yourself.
                                                        91.


                    SALVO
          Well, if I’m being honest, I’ve
          never given that style to anyone
          else before. So, really, I think
          your aura commands a respect I
          typically only reserve for myself.

                    TIGGER
          Mm. I guess I’ll take that.

As they approach the others, Ellie and Sebastian cross over.

                    ELLIE
          Where were you guys? We were
          getting worried.

                    SALVO
          Eh, just duking it out. Your mom’s
          quite a fighter.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Look at you guys. It’s like Jackson
          Pollack started painting on people.
          Who actually won?

Salvo and Tigger look at each other, unsure.

                    TIGGER
          I’m actually not sure who hit the
          other person first.

                    SALVO
          Then let’s say me! No, I’m kidding.

                    TIGGER
          Yeah, unlike the actual Revolution
          we may have to call this one a draw.

Everyone celebrates that verdict, except Frank.

                    FRANK
          Well, wait a minute. Where’s Doug?

They all look around, not seeing him.

                    TIGGER
          Is he not here with you guys? I
          haven’t seen him since the start.

Frank and Tigger start calling for him. Others start helping
them look around. Salvo goes to the snack table.
                                                        92.


                     SALVO
          Yeah, I’d save your breath. That
          kid took off a while ago.
              (then)
          Are these donuts for everyone?

                    TIGGER
          What do you mean he “took off”?
          Where’d he go?

                     SALVO
          No clue. We were just talking about
          his job, or lack thereof, and then
          he just...

Salvo makes the sound and motion of a missile shooting off.
He goes to bite the donut, but Tigger bats it away.

                    TIGGER
              (concerned)
          Are you saying he ran away?!

                    SALVO
          Well, I wouldn’t say “ran.” It was
          more of a labored trot. Like an old
          lady trying to beat a walk signal.

                    TIGGER
          Oh my god. Frank! I think Dougie
          ran away!

                    FRANK
          Oh good lord, not again.

                      SALVO
          “Again”?!

                    FRANK
          He does this every once in a while.
          But usually only in the winter,
          when we forget something on his
          Christmas list.

                    SALVO
              (to Sebastian)
          Are you kidding with this family?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Dad, what’d you say to him!

                    SALVO
          Nothing bad! Just that maybe it was
          time to start acting like a man and
          stop mooching off his parents.
                                                        93.


                    SEBASTIAN
          Why the hell would you do that?!

                    SALVO
          The kid needed to hear it!

                    SEBASTIAN
          No! He didn’t!

                    TIGGER
          How could you not tell me about
          this when we were out in the woods?

                    SALVO
          Didn’t seem like that big of a deal.

                    TIGGER
          Not that big of a-- Oh I see what’s
          going on. You think I’m trying to
          take your son, so you’re trying to
          drive mine away.

                    SALVO
          Oh gimme a break. The kid just went
          somewhere to pout. And at the speed
          he was moving, he won’t get far.

                    TIGGER
          Frank, this is a disaster! Our
          sweet baby boy could be in danger.

                    SALVO
          I think you’re overreacting. We’re
          in a gated community! What’s gonna
          get him -- the HOA fees?

                    FRANK
          Okay, everyone better spread out!

                    TIGGER
          Yeah, we gotta find Doug before he
          gets hurt or kidnapped!

                    SALVO
          Kidnapped?! The guy’s twenty-six! I
          was already bald by that age.

Sebastian covers Salvo’s mouth as the groups canvases the
area. Tigger and Frank look pissed. Ellie’s also worried.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Okay, nobody panic! My dad was a
          tracker back in the war.
                    (MORE)
                                                        94.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          I promise we’ll find him and bring
          him home before his bedtime. Right,
          Dad?

                    SALVO
          Yeah, we’ll find him.
              (can’t help it)
          But for the record a grown man
          should not have a bedtime!

Salvo grabs another donut and walks away, but before he can
take a bite, an angry Tigger shoots it out of his hand.


EXT. THE WOODS - HOURS LATER

It’s now dark as Salvo and a tired, grumpy Sebastian use
phone-lights to search. Salvo checks the ground for clues.

                    SALVO
          I’m pretty sure he went that way.

                    SEBASTIAN
          What, you can tell from footprints?

                    SALVO
          No. From the Almond Joy wrappers.

Salvo points to one and they start moving in that direction.
He slaps at bugs that are biting him throughout.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          This is unbelievable. What kind of
          adult man runs away from home?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Drop it, Dad. This is your fault.
          Try to take some responsibility.

                    SALVO
          My fault?! I just said what people
          should’ve said to him years ago.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Yeah, well, you don’t have to say
          what you’re thinking all the time.

                    SALVO
          It’s ruder not to say it.

                    SEBASTIAN
          No, it isn’t! Jesus, Dad. Why do I
          feel like you’re doing everything
          you can to wreck this for me?
                                      95.


          SALVO
“Wreck it? I’m just making an
effort, like you asked me to.

          SEBASTIAN
Yeah, well, that’s my bad. Turns
out the only thing worse than you
not trying, is you actually trying.
    (shakes his head)
Man, I never should’ve let Ellie
convince me to bring you here.

          SALVO
What do you mean? You invited me!

          SEBASTIAN
Because it was the only way I could
get my grandma’s ring! I didn’t
realize you’d spend the whole time
trying to sabotage me.

          SALVO
Sabotage?! What are you-- Every-
thing I’m doing, and have ever
done, is to give you a better life!

          SEBASTIAN
Yeah, you like to say that, but now
that I’m about to get one, it’s
like you’re trying to stop it!

          SALVO
I’m just trying to make sure you
don’t make a fool of yourself! By
becoming one of these people. I
mean, they’re embarrassing!

          SEBASTIAN
Don’t you see that this is your
problem?! You’re so focused on
other people embarrassing them-
selves that you can’t see the most
embarrassing person... is you.

          SALVO
Pfft. That ain’t true.

          SEBASTIAN
Dad, you cooked their mascot, drove
their son to run away, and made
Tigger look like a drag queen
Marlon Brando! I don’t know what’s
going on with you, but honestly? I
wish I’d never brought you here.
                                                        96.


This hits Salvo like a ton of bricks. He gets real quiet.

                    SALVO
          That really what you think?

Sebastian’s silence says it all. Salvo nods, forcing a smile,
then slaps a big mosquito on his neck.

                    SALVO (CONT’D)
          Damn bugs. They ain’t getting you?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Nah. I, uh... I decided not to go
          with the signature scent today.

Salvo nods again, realizing just how much his son is changing
for this new family. Dejected, he then reaches into his
pocket and pulls out a beautiful diamond engagement ring. He
looks at it for a beat, then offers it to Sebastian.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          No, Dad, you don’t have to--

                    SALVO
          Take it. It’s what your grandma
          wanted; it’s what you want. And if
          you mom was still here, she’d tell
          me to just give you the damn thing.

Sebastian takes the ring and studies it in his hand.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Wow. It’s beautiful.

                    SALVO
          And so is Ellie. You two are lucky
          to have each other.

Salvo forces a smile, then turns to go.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Wait, Dad...

Salvo turns back around and looks at Sebastian.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          We still have to find Doug.

Salvo points to where Doug is sitting lamely up in a tree,
using his phone. As Sebastian looks at Doug, back to the ring
and to Salvo walking off. It’s truly a bittersweet moment and
as Sebastian cradles the ring in his hand and goes to Doug.
And as the Sinatra music swells, we...
                97.




“FORMAGGI E FRUTTA”
                                                        98.


INT. ELLIE’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

Sebastian awakes, then turns over as we see he’s spent the
night with Ellie in her bed. She’s still fast asleep.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          The morning after my father gave me
          the ring, it was the Fourth of
          July. Which was fitting as I was
          finally getting my independence...

Sebastian quietly gets dressed and sneaks out. As he opens
the door, however, Duke barks loudly. Sebastian hustles by.


INT. SEBASTIAN AND SALVO'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Sebastian peeks in to look for Salvo, but see his Dad’s bed
is made with his vacation clothes folded neatly nearby.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          It was an amazing feeling that I’d
          looked forward to for a long time.
          But much like my signature scent,
          it was also a little bittersweet...


EXT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - LATER

Sebastian finds Lucky on the porch doing sit-ups.

                    LUCKY
          Hey. What’s shaking, Sea bass?

                    SEBASTIAN
          Have you seen my father?

                    LUCKY
          Not for a couple hours. He took off
          pretty early in your rental car.
          Said he was going to the airport.

Sebastian expected this, but is a little bummed to hear it.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Right, yeah. He said he might try
          to catch an early flight, so he can
          be at work first thing tomorrow.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Sure, I was ready to spend the rest
          of my life with Ellie. But could I
          really enjoy that life if it meant
          leaving my father behind?
                                                        99.


Sebastian crosses off to watch folks jogging and biking by...

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          And then I got my answer.

Sebastian sees the three remaining peacocks playing together.
He shakes his head, recalling this horror.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          If other species could survive
          without their beloved patriarchs,
          I suppose I could too. And as odd
          as it felt, it was time to start
          preparing for the transition.


INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - LIBRARY - DAY

Sebastian sits across from Frank and Tigger, smiling.

                    SEBASTIAN
          ...so on top of accepting your very
          generous offer to run The Barrymore
          I would also love to ask for your
          permission to propose to Ellie.

Sebastian unearths the ring to show his intention. Frank and
Tigger share a nervous “I don’t know” look. Sebastian starts
to panic, then Frank and Tigger break, laughing.

                    FRANK
          Dude, we’re kidding! You should’ve
          seen the look on your face.

                    TIGGER
          Honestly, Sebastian? This makes us
          both so happy.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Serious? Don’t mess with me.

                    FRANK
          Our answer is an emphatic yes! We
          love you and can’t wait to have you
          and Ellie join the party in DC.

                    TIGGER
          This is perfect! We’re doing our
          family photo in an hour. You can
          propose there and then be in it.
                                                       100.


                    SEBASTIAN
          Thank god! I was genuinely nervous
          about how you’d react after, you
          know, everything that happened with
          my father this weekend.

                    FRANK
          Oh, don’t be silly! We’ve enjoyed
          having him.

                    SEBASTIAN
          You don’t have to say that. He’s
          been such a disaster. With Doug,
          and your hair and...

Sebastian eyes the peacocks still crossing the lawn.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          Everything else.

                     TIGGER
          Eh, he’s a bit like sambuca -- a
          pretty strong taste that’s bearable
          if you brace yourself for it.
              (then)
          And this probably sounds crazy, but
          the hair’s kinda growing on me.

Sebastian laughs, then stops.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Wait, you’re serious?

                    TIGGER
          I am! It’s less maintenance, I feel
          tougher, and I didn’t have to wear
          a visor at tennis this morning...

                    FRANK
          Also helps that she’s been getting
          an incredible online response from
          her last spot on MSNBC.

                    TIGGER
          I didn’t get to say this before he
          left but... I feel like I’ve been
          waiting my whole life for this cut.

                    SEBASTIAN
          His ego would literally explode if
          he heard you say that, but he still
          should’ve asked you.

                                                        101.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          I honestly don’t know what’s been
          going on with him. Since my mom
          passed, he’s just been acting
          crazier and crazier.

                    TIGGER
          Well, the guy really prides himself
          on family. My guess is he’s just
          nervous to lose you.

This lands with Sebastian, who thinks on it.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Yeah. But maybe it’s time for him
          to move on, too. I mean, you should
          see the number of women who hit on
          him back in the salon. Guy could
          make a killing as a gigolo.

They all chuckle at that, then Doug knock/enters, excited.

                    DOUG
          Mom, Dad, I have an announcement!

                    FRANK
          What is it, son?

Doug takes a deep breath, then proclaims:

                    DOUG
          I don’t want to work for the family
          company.

                    FRANK
          That’s the announcement? You’ve
          made that pretty clear over the
          years by, you know, not doing it.

                    TIGGER
          Yeah, it’s a beautiful day. Why
          don’t you go outside and play?

                    DOUG
          Argh, stop talking to me like I’m a
          little kid when I’m not! God!

Doug stomps his foot, petulantly, the resets himself.

                    DOUG (CONT’D)
          I’ve actually decided I want to do
          something important with my life.

                    FRANK / TIGGER
          What? / Really?
                                                         102.


                    TIGGER
          Dougie, did something happen to you
          while you ran away?

                    DOUG
          I didn’t “run away”, Mom! For a
          while now I’ve been feeling lost
          and like a loser and, well, after
          talking to Salvo, I realized I want
          to do something real, you know?
          Something that makes a difference.
          So, I ran to the only spot in this
          stupid resort where you can get
          cell reception so I could...

Doug takes a deep breath as Frank and Tigger.

                    FRANK
              (under his breath)
          Please don’t say masturbate.

                    DOUG
          ...sign up for the Army.

                    TIGGER / FRANK
          What?! / Oh my goodness.

                    FRANK
          Douglas! Are you serious?

                    DOUG
          Yes! I chatted with a recruiter and
          they said I can use my video game
          skills to fly drones and other shit
          that might help our country, just
          like Mom did, and all the other
          great Collins men who have served.

Frank and Tigger share a look, then turn back to Doug.

                    FRANK
          Well, Doug, that’s... wonderful!

                    TIGGER
          It really is, sweetie. I’m so proud
          of you for finding a calling.

                    DOUG
          Right? I’m already a natural at
          blowing shit up online; now I’ll
          get to do it in real life!

Doug turns to leave, then turns back to Sebastian.
                                                       103.


                    DOUG (CONT’D)
          You know, your dad’s kind of a
          dick, but man... He really tells
          people what they need to hear.

As Doug exits, Sebastian further contemplates the effect his
father seems to have had on this family. Then shakes it off
as Frank pops a bottle of champagne to celebrate the moment.


EXT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - DAY

A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER sets up his equipment as Lucky
and Doug prepare for the photo. Sebastian paces, nervously,
near Frank and Tigger, who spots Ellie.

                    TIGGER
          Here she comes! Here she comes!

Tiggers point to Ellie, who approaches with a head of steam.
Frank pats Sebastian on the back, encouragingly.

                    FRANK
          You got this, big guy!
              (to the others)
          Everybody else act natural.

Frank and Tigger act so unnatural, as Sebastian reaches into
his pocket to hold the ring. The photographer starts taking
pictures as Ellie gets closer and Sebastian tries to smile.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          This was moment of truth. I’d
          originally wanted to come to
          Virginia without my dad, so I could
          propose to Ellie and start my new
          life with her. But now that I was
          there, something was just... off.

Ellie arrives. She’s carrying the fancy “Collins Hotel Group”
portfolio and does not look happy.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Hey, Ell! I--

                    ELLIE
          The answer is no, Sebastian!

                    SEBASTIAN
          What?! I haven’t even asked you
          anything yet!
                                                        104.


                    ELLIE
          Well, we’re not doing it. We’re not
          taking the job, we’re not moving to
          DC, we’re not going to spend any
          more time with these manipulators!

Frank and Tigger are completely taken aback.

                    TIGGER
          Honey, what are you talking about?

Ellie holds up the portfolio, flipping through pages.

                    ELLIE
          Oh, I don’t know -- The Tunbridge
          Hotel in Mayfair! The Dresden in
          Geneva! The Shangri-La in Sydney!
          What do they all have in common?

                    FRANK
          A five star experience at a three
          star price? Why are you so angry?

                    ELLIE
          The answer is: THEIR LOBBY ART!

                       TIGGER
          Uh oh.

Frank and Tigger look busted, while Sebastian is confused.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Babe, what’s going on?

                    ELLIE
          Look at these pictures. You notice
          anything familiar about the walls?

Ellie flips through them again for Sebastian to see.

                    ELLIE (CONT’D)
          My painting! My painting! My
          painting! Oooh, what’s this one? Oh
          yeah, MY PAINTING!

                       SEBASTIAN
          Oh my god.

                    TIGGER
          Ellie, we can explain.
                                                       105.


                    ELLIE
          What, that I thought I’d been
          selling my work to this cool new
          designer when really you two just
          hired her to buy my pieces?

                    FRANK
          That’s technically accurate, but we
          do think your work is amazing! And
          what could be better to hang in our
          family hotels than paintings done
          by an actual Collins daughter?

                    LUCKY
          Wait a sec, aren’t your paintings
          all pretty... vaginal?

                    FRANK
          Sure, if you hang them vertically.
          But on their side they look more
          like sunsets.

Frank shows the Portfolio pictures. Lucky nods, convinced.

                    ELLIE
          Ugh! Here, I thought I was kicking
          ass in the art world -- selling out
          my shows to private buyers -- but
          turns out I’m just getting the same
          allowance I got my whole life in a
          much more screwed up way. I might
          as well have just hung out and
          played video games all day!

                    DOUG
          Feels like an unnecessary shot at
          the ol’ Dougster.

                    TIGGER
          Baby, we’re sorry we didn’t tell
          you. It’s just... the art world can
          be so cruel. We wanted to help you
          get a jumpstart.

                    ELLIE
          And that’s what you’ve done our
          whole lives -- bribing our way on
          to sports teams, rewriting our
          college essays, hiring rappers to
          emcee our birthday parties.

                    LUCKY
          You’re great parents! Don’t let her
          guilt you into changing your ways!
                                                       106.


                    ELLIE
          All I want is to feel like I’m
          accomplishing stuff on my own, you
          know? Like you did, Mom. When you
          joined the Navy and then stormed
          your way into politics.

                    TIGGER
          That was hard though. My parents
          never supported me. And we just
          hate to see our kids suffer.

                    ELLIE
          Sometimes suffering can be good!
              (takes Sebastian’s hand)
          You know, one of the many reasons I
          love being with Sebastian is because
          he’s such a hard worker and when
          we’re together, I feel like we’re
          tackling life on our own terms. And
          now I feel like this whole weekend
          has just been one big elaborate ruse
          to get us to move into back into
          your bubble and I’m sorry but I just
          don’t want this kind of help.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          And that was the moment everything
          finally started to make sense.

This lands with Tigger and Frank, who smile sympathetically.

                    TIGGER
          We’re so sorry, Ellie. We should’ve
          told you what we were doing.

                    ELLIE
          Yeah. You should’ve.

Ellie sighs and turns to Sebastian, who is deep in thought.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Here I was, the son of an Italian
          immigrant, about to propose to the
          girl of my dreams, and join one of
          the most prominent families in
          America, and I was going to do it
          without the man who’d raised me to
          be the guy Ellie fell in love with.

                    ELLIE
          I’m sorry, babe -- did you have
          something you wanted to ask me?
                                                         107.


                    SEBASTIAN
          Yeah, I uh... do have a question.

Sebastian plays with the ring inside his pocket...

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          Standing there, I realized I had
          everything I wanted; but not what I
          needed. And that was my lifelong
          hero by my side while I made the
          most important decision of my life.

                    SEBASTIAN
          What time does the evening flight
          leave for Chicago?

                    TIGGER
          I think it takes off at six.

                     SEBASTIAN
          I want to continue this convo, Ell.
          But right now I need to go talk to
          my father.

                    ELLIE
          But it’s 5:30. There’s no way you
          can get to the airport in time.

                    SEBASTIAN
          There is one way. Lucky?

Sebastian takes a huge deep breath, then turns to Lucky and
channels the intensity of Arnold Schwarzenegger as he says...

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          Get me to the chopper.

As the Sinatra-music kicks on, we...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. RURAL VIRGINIA - ESTABLISHING SHOT

A helicopter soars over a gorgeous mountainous vista.

                    LUCKY (O.S.)
          How you doing back there, Sea Bass?


INT. LUCKY'S HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Lucky turns around to see Sebastian absolutely dying, as he
wheezes and tries to shed layers while buckled in.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Not good, Luck! NOT GOOD!

                    LUCKY
          Want me to turn around?

                    SEBASTIAN
          No! It’s just so hot! And I can’t
          breathe! Keep going, I’m fine!

As he turns and vomits out the window, we...


EXT. REMOTE VIRGINIA AIRPORT - DAY

As the chopper blades slow, Sebastian jumps out in underwear.
He puts his clothes back on as he races toward the entrance.


INT. REMOTE VIRGINIA AIRPORT - DAY

The two overweight TSA AGENTS from the beginning take turns
throwing donut holes over the x-ray machine, trying to land
them in each other’s mouths. A GATE ATTENDANT cleans up the
gate after what is clearly a completed boarding process as
Sebastian (now dressed but still sweaty) bursts in..

                    SEBASTIAN
          Has the plane left for Chicago?!

                    GATE ATTENDANT
          No, but that flight is closed. It’s
          already taxiing on the runway.
              (off his appearance)
          Sir, would you like a towel?

                    SEBASTIAN
          No! Please! I need to talk to
          someone on that plane!
                                                         110.


                    GATE ATTENDANT
          Yeah, that’s not gonna happen.

The TSA Agents step behind her to reinforce her point.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Okay, I’m sorry. Thanks.

Sebastian turns away and as they all stand down, he does a
Michael Jackson-style dance move to spin around the metal
detector, then sprints past them out onto the tarmac.


EXT. REMOTE VIRGINIA AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

SEBASTIAN bursts from the airport, sprinting to the plane.
The TSA Officers chase after him, calling out:

                    TSA OFFICER
          Sir, stop! You can’t be out here!

                    SEBASTIAN
          All due respect, Officer Man Boobs!
          But I gotta stop that plane!

The TSA Officers double over with cramps. One dry heaves as
Sebastian races ahead, heading off the plane.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          Stop the plane! Please! I need to
          tell you something!

The plane grinds to a halt. The door opens and lowers to the
ground, and it’s Salvo who gets off.

                    SALVO
          What are you doing, son? And why
          does it look like you swam here?

Sebastian looks at his father and takes a deep breath.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Look, Dad. I came here to say that
          I know you can be stubborn, cheap,
          obnoxious and severely judgmental.
          And for the past year, I’ve been
          wondering if I should check you
          into a mental institution.

                    SALVO
          Son, if you don’t bend this around
          to a compliment soon, I’m gonna get
          back on that plane.
                                        111.


          SEBASTIAN
But the truth is, those quirks are
part of what makes you the greatest
Dad I ever could’ve ever hoped for.

          SALVO
I’m listening...

          SEBASTIAN
Sure, it ain’t always easy being
your son, but the way you raised
me... it’s why I’m the man I am
today. The same man who, for some
reason, Ellie seems to love.

           SALVO
Yeah, I’ve never been able to put
my finger on that one either.
    (then)
But you got my mother’s ring. You
can propose to her. What else do
you need from me?

          SEBASTIAN
I need you to be a part of our lives.

          SALVO
But you said I was embarrassing.

          SEBASTIAN
Whatever you are, I love it. And
the truth is you haven’t changed
since I was a kid; but I have.
    (getting emotional)
Which is why I’ve stopped realizing
that... that... you’re my hero.

           SALVO
Stop it.

          SEBASTIAN
It’s true, Dad. You’ve sacrificed
so much and everything that’s good
in my life, I owe it to you.

          SALVO
No. It’s because good things happen
to good kids. And honestly I have
been acting crazier, because...
    (also getting emotional)
I brought you to America to give
you a chance at a better life, but
now that you’re about to get it...
    (fully choked up)
          (MORE)
                                                       112.

                    SALVO (CONT'D)
          I’m afraid once you gonna marry
          Ellie, I’m gonna lose the last
          family I’ve got.

                    SEBASTIAN
              (starting to cry)
          Dad, don’t you cry or I’m gonna...

                    SALVO
              (also starting to cry)
          I can’t help it.

Both men fully start crying, standing stoically face-to-face,
marinating in the thick tears rolling down their cheeks.

                    SEBASTIAN
          You’re never gonna lose me, Dad! I
          want you to be in my life forever!
          Whether it’s Chicago or D.C. or
          wherever, so you can help me
          instill the same values in my kids
          that you instilled in me.

                    SALVO
          That’s all what I want, too!

                    SEBASTIAN
          I love you, Dad!

                    SALVO
          I love you too, Sebastian!
              (to sky, in Italian)
          You hear that, my love! I told you
          we couldn’t leave this beautiful
          boy in that orphanage!

Salvo and Sebastian hug each other, still fully crying, as we
reveal the TSA Agents watching, both way freaked out.

                    GATE ATTENDANT (O.S.)
              (over Walkie-Talkie)
          Back-up is on its way. What’s the
          situation out there, guys?

                    TSA OFFICER
          I’m not sure. Do we have an
          emergency code for “Two Grown Men
          Crying on the Tarmac”?

As Salvo and Sebastian continue the emotional embrace, we...

EXT. THE VILLAGE OF WHITE OAK - THAT EVENING

The town is abuzz with a patriotic parade, as wealthy people
dressed in red, white, and blue walk and ride on firetrucks,
convertibles, and golf-carts-turned-parade-floats.

Frank, Doug, and Tigger (all in military uniforms) ride atop
their golf-cart-turned-Navy-ship with Frank steering. Tigger
leans into Ellie, who smiles, but is clearly still annoyed.

                    TIGGER
          You wanna do the honors?

Ellie shrugs and presses a button, cuing a big navy FOGHORN.
Several parade viewers fall over from the blast.

                    DOUG
          Oh snap! Here they come!

Doug points to Lucky’s helicopter drop from the sky and prep
to land in front of the parade, with Sebastian and Salvo
leaning proudly out of it. As it lowers, Sebastian jumps off
and walks confidently to Ellie, with Salvo close behind.

                    SEBASTIAN
          Eleanor Mallory Collins! Can I
          please have a word with you?

Ellie can’t help but be a bit embarrassed as she goes to him.

                    ELLIE
          What the heck are you doing, babe?
          You’re making such a big scene.

                    SEBASTIAN
          We’ve earned it, babe. Now...

Sebastian gets down on one knee, as everyone watches,
including Frank, Tigger, Doug, and Lucky who venture over.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          Ellie, I’ve recently come to
          appreciate the fact that nothing in
          life is more important than family.
          Sure, they may be embarrassing. And
          smothering. And sometimes express
          their love in a way that’s pretty--

                       ELLIE
          Fucked up?

Frank and Tigger take each other’s hands, feeling guilty.
                                                       115.


                    SEBASTIAN
          Exactly. But at the end of the day,
          they’re not doing it because
          they’re malicious; they’re just
          trying to do what’s best for us, no
          matter what, with the tools they
          inherited from their own parents.

This makes sense. Ellie looks over at her parents. They mouth
sorry. She smiles, forgiving them a bit.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
          So in this moment, surrounded by
          our beautiful families -- and these
          complete random strangers -- would
          you make me the luckiest man on
          Earth and marry me? So we can make
          our own family, full of tiny kids
          who will one day think we’re the
          most embarrassing people on Earth?!

Sebastian offers his grandmother’s ring. Ellie smiles huge.

                    ELLIE
          Yes! Of course I will, YES! WE’LL
          BE THE MOST EMBARRASSING PARENTS
          THEY CAN EVER IMAGINE!

Everyone cheers. And as Sebastian slides the ring over her
finger, Salvo, Frank, and Tigger come over to give them
congratulatory hugs. As they do, the village fireworks start
going off in the background. It’s a huge display.

                    TIGGER
          Oh my god, the fireworks! This will
          make the perfect family photo!

                       DOUG
          I’m on it.

Doug hands his phone to a stranger, then joins the others for
a big group photo. It’s an amazing scene as both families
gather together and the camera captures a series of shots.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
          And there you have it, folks: An a-
          typical American love story about a
          man reconnecting with his hero of a
          father, and two different brands of
          immigrant families coming together.

In the family photo, Sebastian finds himself right where he
wants to be -- with an arm around his father and Ellie.
                                                         116.


                    SEBASTIAN
          So you can start crunching that
          popcorn and grab your phones to
          check how few people texted you,
          because there’s nothing left for us
          to do but start planning a wedding.
          Which should be easy enough...

                    FRANK
          Congratulations, guys. Of course,
          Tigger and I would love to have the
          wedding at our chapel in D.C.

                    SALVO
          D.C.? I was thinking Sicily. We
          could have the whole ceremony in my
          grandfather’s garden.

                    SEBASTIAN
          There’s a lot of time to figure it
          out. And all that matters is we’re
          all together.

They all share a happy moment, then Doug notices something.

                    DOUG
          Is that Duke over there? And what’s
          he carrying?

The whole town looks to see the Collins’ large dog coming out
of the woods dragging... As he gets closer, everyone sees
he’s carrying THE FUCKING PEACOCK CARCASS!

                    FRANK
          Oh my god, is that Sgt. Feathers?

                       SEBASTIAN
          Holy shit!

Sebastian and Salvo share a terrified look, then yell:

            SALVO                        SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Duke murdered a peacock!           Duke murdered a peacock!

And on our father and son Maniscalco back in sync and
surviving yet another disaster via FAMILY, we...

                                              FADE TO BLACK.
