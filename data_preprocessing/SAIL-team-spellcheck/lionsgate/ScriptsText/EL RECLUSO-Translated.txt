1              EXT. FRONT CABIN - DUNK
               It's been a little over a year since Dante ran away from La
               Rotunda.
               In a small Mexican village lost in the middle of nowhere, a
               man cuts wood in the tranquility of a cold afternoon.
               Beyond, a warm cabin, a jeep parked on the side and more
               trees.

               After several cut logs we reveal that the man is DANTE. It
               looks different to hide its identity (with grown beard and
               hair).

               When he finishes his homework, he throws the axe into a log
               and enters the cabin with the logs.

2              INT. CABIN / LIVING - DUNK

               In continuity. Dante enters the cabin with the logs and
               throws them into the fire of the house already lit. Sitting
               at the table is FRIDA, who, we understand, is Dante 's
               couple and helps PABLITO, Dante 's son with school chores.
               The boy snorts bored.

                                                         FRIDA
                                               If you know... Come on... Don’t be
                                               lazy.

                                                         PABLITO
                                               Pa! What is the San Andreas fault?
               Dante thinks, looking for a simple way to explain it.

                                                         DANTE
                                               Well, they taught me that a long
                                               time ago, in geography class, the
                                               fault is... the San Francisco
                                               earthquake...
               Frida intervenes.

                                                         FRIDA
                                                   (funny reproof)
                                               No, it's not worth asking for
                                               help! How alive you are.
               Dante smiles as he takes off his coat.

                                                         DANTE
                                               Cheating again?

                                                         PABLITO
                                               I just don't remember. They won’t let
                                               me use the phone to search!

                                                         DANTE
                                               No, no internet.
               Frida and Dante exchange glances. Pablito flirts his eyes.
               Dante stirs her hair.

                                                         DANTE (COUNT'D)
                                               You also have the best teacher, so
                                               don't complain.
               Frida smiles at him sweetly. Dante kisses her and looks at her
               in love.

3              INT. Cabin / Bedroom - NIGHT
               It's a cold night out. Inside, the heat of the home tarnished
               the windows. Dante and Frida are making love, in bed, barely
               covered by a sheet. They do it tenderly. Dante looks her in
               the eye, caresses her. Frida kisses him old scars he has on
               his body. They come to orgasm together.

4              EXT. Cabin / Surroundings - Night
               In the vicinity of the estate where the cottage is located,
               the outer perimeter, several tens of meters away, bodies
               moving in the shadows. In the moonlight, we discovered that
               these are uniformed agents are Interpol, armed, an assault
               group. One of them, the Chief, gives the orders, and signs to
               separate. Three go to the house, as advanced. The Chief
               mobilizes with the remaining agent, but more lagging behind.

5              INT. Cabin / Bedroom - NIGHT

               Frida and Dante lying, face to face, smiling, talking in
               whispers.

                                                         FRIDA
                                               I'm sure Pablo fell asleep, didn't he?
                                                         DANTE
                                               He fell surrendered. The teacher
                                               is very severe with him and
                                               exhausts him.
               Frida relaxes and laughs.

                                               I leave you exhausted, too, it
                                               seems.

                                                         DANTE
                                                   (fun)
                                               Oh, yeah? I can teach you some things
                                               too, ma'am teacher...
               It tickles him, they both laugh, funny.

6              EXT. FRONT                           CABETA
               The three advance men approach the sector surrounding the
               cabin, they approach stealthily.
               The chief and his escort watch the action, from afar, they
               settle on one side.
               DETAIL: the feet of the one accompanying the boss stumble on
               a purposefully tensioned nylon thread . It’s almost
               imperceptible, and he doesn't notice it. But the thread
               stretches. It's an alarm system.

7              INT. Cabin / Bedroom - NIGHT

               Dante observes Frida, admired.

                                                         DANTE
                                               You're so beautiful...
               They kiss again . Suddenly, Dante takes her away from
               himself. He doesn't smile anymore , something warns him. He
               looks at the side of the bed.

               DETAIL: On the wall a silent alarm device , with a small red
               LED light , flickering.

               Dante tells Frida, with a gesture, to be quiet. She doesn’t
               understand, but she obeys. Dante looks under the mattress
               and pulls out an automatic gun. Frida is approaching Dante.

                                                         FRIDA
                                                   (whispers)
                                               Pablito...
               Dante nods, and comes out of the room. Frida follows him.

8              EXT. CABIN - CONT.

               The agents are already at the entrance, crouching. One of
               them without making noise, manipulates the lock and the door
               opens.

9              INT. CABIN - CONT.
               Dante's eyes , crouching behind a sofa, in the dark. In the
               gloom, the front door of the house, begins to open.

10             INT. Cabin / Living room - NIGHT
               The three Interpol agents have already entered, pointing
               their rifles and laser sights everywhere , looking through
               their night vision lenses .
               Dante, wielding his gun, takes action and surprises one of
               the agents, hits him, disarms him and causes him to fall.
               Kick the assault rifle away from the range of the fallen
               agent, and immediately face another agent coming on him.
               He dodges his shot, and they both get into a melee fight .
               In the middle of the fight, Frida appears from inside with
               Pablito in his arms. Pablito is in his pajamas, just awake
               and scared. Fridais also extremely nervous.

               Dante fights the agent, holding the rifle so he can't use it.
               They struggle. Frida is caught by the third agent who also
               appears from inside. Frida screams:

                                                                              FRIDA
                                               Dante!
               Dante takes down the agent and throws at the third agent
               who targets Frida from the inside, at the same time
               directing him Frida to come out a door on the side.

                                                                              DANTE
                                               Get out!
               Frida gets out, leaving Dante behind in the middle of a
               fight.

11             EXT. FRONT                           CABETA
               In continuity. Frida runs with Pablito towards the parked
               jeep .

            The squad leader and his escort set in motion to try and
            stop her. The deputy points his rifle, while the chief
            pulls out his gun, and yells at him.

                                                      CIVIL AGENT
                                                (shouts in English)
                                            Stop!
            Frida doesn't stop and keeps running, carrying Pablito. The
            agent is about to pull the trigger when Dante suddenly shows
            up and attacks him in the back. They fight and the agent ends
            up shooting into the sky. Frida and Pablito arrive at the
            jeep and Frida turns it on.
            The boss hits Dante on the head, he responds, and the two
            roll to the ground wrestling. The agent seeks to get his gun
            back, while Dante looks for something to defend himself. On
            the side is the axe we saw him use, during the afternoon, to
            cut firewood.

            The officer points the gun at him. Dante neutralizes him ,
            deflecting the shot. Then, by means of an agile movement he
            manages to get on top of the agent and grab the axe. It is a
            crucial moment, the agent's face reveals fear, as he is
            lost. His gaze and Dante's are intersecting. But Dante,
            instead of finishing off, hits him with the handle of the
            axe on his forehead.

            The agent is fainted, and Dante runs away. The other agents
            recover, and they go after him. Dante comes to the jeep and
            jumps in.

                                                      DANTE
                                            Come on, come on, go!
            Frida starts and leaves at full speed. Agents get in their
            vehicles and follow them.

12          I/E. LAND ROUT/JEEP - NIGHT
            Frida drives the jeep at full                                                               speed along a dirt road that
            later leads to the main route                                                               . Pablito is crouching in the
            gap in front of the passenger                                                               seat . Dante, in the back
            seat, he's shooting his rifle                                                               at the Interpol cars chasing
            them .   Until he runs out of                                                               bullets. He realizes he's lost.

                                                  DANTE
                                           (screams)
                                       Brakes! Stop it, Frida! That's it!

                                                      FRIDA
                                            I can get to the route!
                                                      DANTE
                                            They're going to kill us!
                                                      FRIDA
                                            Trust me! We're almost there!
            Dante goes over to the passenger seat and yells at Pablito.

                                                       DANTE
                                            Stay crouched! (
                                                to Frida)
                                            I won 't forgive myself if
                                            something happens to them !
                                            Frida!
            Frida steps the accelerator thoroughly. Go sideways through
            the rearview mirror that the cars that are chasing them are
            falling behind. It's about to join the main route. Dante
            looks at her and stop arguing with her. He grabs his hand,
            cheering him up. He thinks he’s going to make it. And all of
            a sudden...

                                                                         DANTE (COUNT'D)
                                            Careful!
            When they are about to reach the route, a military truck
            comes out of the trees and closes their way. Frida has to
            stick the brakes to avoid colliding. The jeep zigzags
            dangerously, she almost loses control, but manages to
            stabilize it. It breaks a few inches from crashing into the
            truck.
            Pablito cries. Dante and Frida are terrified. Relieved to
            survive the crash, but they know they 're lost. Military men
            get out of the truck and point them with long guns. Interpol
            cars catch them up and the agents get off to arrest them.
            Dante and Frida look defeated. They've been captured.
                                                                            OPENING CREDITS

13          INT. Presidential BUNKER - NIGHT
            A video graph says: A year later . It is the night of
            proclamation of candidacy for re-election. US President
            Robert Baker is running fora second term.
            In the bunker, decoration, catering and everything is first
            class. Baker, watch it again. ROBERT BAKER (52) celebrates
            the proclamation with his family and team of collaborators.
            He's on his way to re-election.

            Baker waits for the applause to finish and give a fiery
            campaign speech on stage. The characters speak in English.

                                                      BAKER
                                            Thank you! Thank you all    for
                                            being here tonight, supporting
                                            me!
            Baker 's audience looks at him with admiration, conviction,
            hope. He’s a charismatic leader and he's got them hypnotized.

                                                      BAKER (COUNT'D)
                                            Four years ago, I stood in this
                                            very place and spoke to them with
                                            the same conviction. You were a
                                            lot less than now...

            Baker takes a strategic break, and the audience laughs. He's
            smiling.

                                                      BAKER (COUNT'D)
                                            I don't blame them. They thought
                                            he was crazy, or at best he was
                                            naive, for believing that a
                                            different America was possible.
                                            But four years later, more and more
                                            of us know that a different America IS
                                            possible!
            The audience roars and bursts in applause.
                                                                                                                              CUTTING AND CUTTING:

14          INT. US MILITARY PRISON - NIGHT
            Dante is in a military prison (awaiting trial for the
            involuntary murder of Judge Morris). It has the look of
            season 1:short hair , no beard. Dinner alone, at along table
            where other prisoners eat in company, more integrated into
            the prison community. Not Dante. He's self-absorbed and
            isolated from the rest.

            In the background, on a TV, guards and prisoners watch
            President Robert Baker's fiery speech .

                                                      BAKER
                                            This is not a campaign speech . My
                                            only campaign is my management,
                                            which speaks for me and for the
                                            men and women who helped bring
                                            this great nation back to the
                                            place that was deserves.
                                                                     ( MORE)

                                                     BAKER (COUNT'D)
                                           When I assumed, America was mired
                                           in despair and disenchantment. In
                                           the lack of work and crime...

           Dante looks at the screen but without much interest.
           COURT TO BUNKER: Baker follows his speech:
                                                     BAKER (COUNT'D)
                                           But I trusted my people, just as
                                           my people trusted me. Together, we
                                           made America one of the Americans
                                           again!

           People clap, whistle, party.
           On the side of the stage, the First Lady (SUSAN) and Baker's
           children look at him with admiration. A few steps back,
           almost in the gloom of the back room, is REGINA KING - head
           of intelligence and chief advisor to Baker. The camera first
           focuses on Susan and her expression of happiness. But then he
           puts her out of focus and focuses on Regina, who observes
           Baker with a serious, restrained worry.

                                                     BAKER (COUNT'D)
                                           My dream is to live in a country
                                           where all American children can
                                           grow up with the same opportunities
                                           as my children. A country where all
                                           American mothers can send their
                                           children to school without fear of
                                           being killed for two dollars...

           Those present deny, whistle flunking.

                                                     BAKER (COUNT'D)
                                           I promise to continue working for
                                           that dream! I repeat this is not a
                                           campaign speech . This is a
                                           speech of thanks and, above all, a
                                           speech to reaffirm the same thing I
                                           said to you here four years ago...
                                           For the Americans, EVERYTHING!

           Everyone present applauds him warmly. Balloons fall on the
           crowd and celebratory music begins to play. For a moment
           everything turns into a chaos of photographic flashes,
           people who congratulate each other, etc. But in the midst of
           that chaos, Baker comes to Susan and her children. He greets
           them excited. He gives him a tender kiss on the lips,
           measured, and the whole family poses for a triumphant photo.
           They are seen as an exemplary family, the living image of
           success.

            After the photo, Regina takes advantage of and subtly
            approaches Baker. He shakes hands that greet him, always
            smiling.
            Regina speaks to her ear, quietly so that no one can hear them
            .
                                                      REGINA
                                            Mr. President, we need to talk.
            Baker nods, while he continues to greet those present and
            take pictures with his family.

15          INT. PRESIDENTIAL BUNKER/ PRIVATE

            Baker comes in following Regina. It loosens the knot of the
            tie and throws the bones of the neck. He still carries the
            energy of his enthusiastic speech. He's intrigued, but not
            worried. He keeps smiling. In contrast, Regina is very
            serious. While he talks to her, she makes a quick review of
            the room to make sure they're alone.

                                                      BAKER
                                            It's never good news if you call
                                            me “president”...
            Regina closes the doors and locks the lock. Baker's starting
            to worry. His smile is blurred.

                                                      BAKER (COUNT'D)
                                            How bad is it?
            Regina tells you a chair. Baker takes a seat and looks at her
            carefully .

                                                      BAKER (COUNT'D)
                                            I don't understand, what is it about?
            Regina takes out of her wallet a small device, like a tablet.
            And a flash drive.

                                                      REGINA
                                            Three days ago, they left this on my
                                            doorstep.
            INSERT: On the door of her house, in the morning , Regina in
            sportswear and air pods (comes from running) stops and
            before entering, check the mail locker. There's a couple of
            cards, and a flash drive, on the loose. He examines it, he
            has written “Baker.”

            TURN TO THE PRESENT: Baker intrigued by Regina, who is
            showing him the same pen drive.

16          INT. BASEMENT HACTORS - DAY
            At the top of the screen, we see the video that Regina shows
            you.
                                                                       Th
            e place is unrecognizable, could be any space. In it you see
            JULIA (16), a young girl who looks at the camera, tearful
            and frightened in the middle of a confession.

                                                      JULIA
                                            My name is Julia. I'm 16 years
                                            old. A few months ago, I...
                                                ( it costs you)
                                            I was forced to have sex
                                            with...
            She looks out of camera and someone encourages her to talk.

                                                      JULIA (COUNT'D)
                                            ... the President of the United
                                            States, Robert Baker.
            IN THE PRIVATE ROOM: Baker acknowledges receipt and turns
            pale, although he still shows no greater reaction. He's got
            his eyes fixed on the screen. Regina has her eyes fixed on
            Baker.

            ON THE VIDEO: Julia wipes her tears and continues:

                                                      JULIA (COUNT'D)
                                            I was so afraid because... I've
                                            never been with a man before ,
                                            but... I couldn't refuse...
                                                (breaks into tears)
                                            And now I'm expecting a baby...
            Julia embraces her nascent belly about 3 or 4 months pregnant,
            tears run down her cheeks.
            IN THE PRIVATE ROOM: Robert unbuckles the collar of his
            shirt. Suddenly he’s a little bit short of air. Keep
            looking.

17          INT. PRESIDENTIAL BUNKER/ PRIVATE

            Regina pulls the flash drive off the device. Baker is shocked
            by what he just saw.

                                                      BAKER
                                            What is this nonsense? Please! That
                                            girl... It's the first time I've
                                            ever seen her in my life... To
                                            what extent are my enemies able to
                                            reach in order to harm me?

            Regina 's not answering. Just look at him. Baker curses,
            gets up and goes straight to a piece of furniture, serves a
            whiskey, very nervous. He's no longer the convincing and
            hopeful man we saw a few minutes ago.

                                                      REGINA
                                            Robert, no one 's seen this
                                            material yet. If you tell me that
                                            man isn't you, I know what I have
                                            to do. But if it isn't, I need to
                                            know.
            Baker supports the empty glass strongly. He grabs his head,
            desperate. Regina gives her her own glass. Baker drinks
            another little. His eyes are glassy, he's about to break.

                                                      BAKER

                                           of covering your back. But that
                                           was when you were governor,

           Regina alludes to the magnitude of the act and the
           presidential figure . Baker nods. He starts to give in. He
           shows himself vulnerable.

                                                     BAKER
                                           It's different now.

                                           Of course, it's different.

                                           I didn't know... She... And a
                                           pregnancy?
           Baker chokes on words.
                                                     REGINA
                                           She's a teenager. And you're the
                                           president of the United States. I
                                           don’t understand.

                                           At first I thought I had it under

                                           to jail for this.
           Baker opens his eyes big, terrified.

           Regina puts her hand on her shoulder, giving her
           encouragement. For the first time, take a seat next to him.

                                                     REGINA
                                               (nods)
                                           And we don't know if they'd keep
                                           their word.
           Baker cares even more.
                                                                          BAKER
                                           So?
                                                     REGINA
                                           We have to rescue the girl.
                                           Without it there is no threat. The
                                           video could be refuted as
                                           “Fakenews.” But the girl is
                                           something else .
           Baker assimilates and nods. Regina looks very serious.

                                                     REGINA (CONT'D)
                                           How did you meet her?
                                                     BAKER
                                           It was just one more time . I
                                           didn't even know his name until
                                           now. Jeffrey brought her...

                                                     REGINA
                                               (reproving unbeliever)
                                           Jeffrey Morales? I thought you
                                           stopped seeing him when you got to
                                           Washington.

                                                     BAKER
                                           I've only seen him a couple of
                                           times, occasionally , and then...

                                                     REGINA
                                           Is there anyone else involved?
                                                     BAKER
                                           No, no. I can contact you, I have
                                           your contact on an old phone.

                                                     REGINA
                                           Don't even think about it. If you
                                           keep getting involved, this is going
                                           to end up knowing. I have to handle
                                           it, off the record.

            Baker nods, desperate.

                                                      BAKER
                                            It's all right. You have the green
                                            light to do whatever it takes. But
                                            save me from this one. I beg you
                                            for our friendship.
            Regina gets in motion. Baker disheveled, exhausted, aged,
            stands up and does not let her go. He’s holding his hands.
                                                     BAKER (COUNT'D)
                                            And thank you.
            Regina nods, with a bitter smile. Let go of his hand and
            leave.

18          INT. JEFFREY HOUSE - DAY
            A couple of agents break in the door down. They're wielding
            their weapons. Behind them, enter Regina. They're moving
            through the house. They pass through living room, dining
            room, on the table there is a dish served, half eaten, where
            a fly flutters .
            Food wrappers , the typical scene of someone who has eaten
            alone, bought food.
            There are no signs of violence, but on the floor, there is a
            broken glass , and a fallen fork and napkin. Something
            interrupted dinner .
            They advance, cross the house and reach the bedroom. On the
            bed, JEFFREY MORALES (50) is lying. He’s pale, big dark
            circles, eyes closed, looks dead. Jeffrey 's bed and clothes
            are stained with vomit.

            Regina keeps the gun, takes his pulse, and tries to revive
            him.

                                                      REGINA
                                            Jeffrey! Jeffrey! Do you hear me?
                                            Hey! Jeffrey!
                                                (to officers)
                                            Call for an
                                            ambulance.
            One of the agents comes out asking for help with the handy.
            Jeffrey's not responding. Regina takes a little bottle of
            perfume out of her backpack , uncovers it and puts it close
            to Jeffrey 's nose.
            Jeffrey opens his eyes; his gaze is lost. Regina looks at
            the other agent accompanying her and gives her an
            indication.

           The agent comes out and blinds the door. Regina talks to
           Jeffrey as she examines his eyes.

                                                     REGINA (CONT'D)
                                           Jeffrey, listen to me...
           Jeffrey is leaving. Regina slaps him to revive him. Jeffrey
           open his eyes. It points with difficulty towards the remains
           of food.

                                                     JEFFREY
                                           They poisoned me, the bastards.
                                                     REGINA
                                           Help is on its way.
           Jeffrey looks at Julia, he seems to recognize her.

                                                     REGINA (CONT'D)
                                           I need you to tell me what you know
                                           about the girl kidnapped by the Ramos
                                           cartel . I know you introduced her to
                                           Baker. Julia.

                                                     JEFFREY
                                               (weakly)
                                           Sweet Julia...
           Jeffrey 's eyes are white. She shakes him.

                                                     REGINA
                                           Stay with me.
                                                     JEFFREY
                                           I offered one of my girls, but the
                                           bastard wanted a virgin.

           Regina is shocked to hear that.
                                                     REGINA
                                           And what happened?
                                                     JEFFREY
                                           She got her pregnant. I was going
                                           to take her to an abortion, but I
                                           had a misunderstanding with some
                                           people, and I had to turn her in.

                                                     REGINA
                                           What people? Cartel people?
                                           Where did you take her?
           Jeffrey smiles weakly.

                                                     JEFFREY
                                           The drugs thing went wrong... a
                                           misunderstanding...
           Regina is urgent, wants to get information from him before he
           dies.

                                                     REGINA
                                           Were they threatening you ? Did
                                           you give them Julia?
           Jeffrey nod. He has a moment of lucidity before the end.

                                                      JEFFREY
                                           I thought they 'd leave me alone
                                           with this . A virgin pregnant with
                                           the most important man in the
                                           world. It’s almost biblical, isn’t
                                           it? I gave them a chance to turn a
                                           president.

           Jeffrey shudders in pain, gives him an arcade, sweats
           copiously. Regina holds it , puts a hand on her forehead .
           Jeffrey 's eyes close, delirious, murmuring a lullaby-like
           tune . Regina is desperate.

                                                     REGINA
                                           Where do they have her?
           Jeffrey's not answering. Regina shakes him.
                                                                          REGINA (CONT'D)
                                           Jeffrey!
           Regina looks at the door, on the other side are her agents.
                                                     REGINA (CONT'D)
                                           Where is that ambulance?
           Regina takes Jeffrey’s vitals .                                                                       He’s dead.
                                                                          REGINA (CONT'D)
                                           Shit.
           Regina laments. He takes a step back and looks in the mirror,
           standing next to the dead man. It remains an instant
           overcome, but immediately recomposes and acts. Look around,

19          INT. CYBERCRIME OFFICE - DAY

            It's the next day. Regina is clean, in other clothes.
            Regina meets with SIDNEY (young, modern, shaved on the side,
            with tattoos), a hacker of her utmost confidence. There are
            no people around, but they still take care not to raise their
            voices.
            The characters speak in English.

                                                      REGINA
                                            What did you find out?
                                                      SIDNEY
                                                (jokes)
                                            The owner of this cell phone had a
                                            lot of friends.
            Sidney shows Jeffrey's cell phone , unarmed. An encryption
            program is run on a computer, and a telephone communication
            tree is deployed.

                                                      REGINA
                                            I'm only interested in last week's
                                            calls .

                                                      SIDNEY
                                            That's what I assumed. There's an
                                            avalanche of messages.
            Sidney unfolds some and Regina reads.
                                                      SIDNEY (CONT'D)
                                            They were extorting him. They
                                            look like cartel people.

            Sidney works on the screen and the tree shrinks visibly.
            There's only one list of communications left.

                                                       REGINA
                                            Are those the numbers? Where do they
                                            come from?
            Sidney keeps typing.

                                                      SIDNEY
                                            That’s what's interesting. There
                                            are some in the city, but these
                                            coordinates indicate that the
                                            messages are coming from...

           On the screen displays the map of North America, some points
           in Washington, a couple loose. And a big spot on the U.S.-
           Mexico border, in Baja California.

                                           What is that?
           Sidney plays some more keys. On the screen, the map
           displays a pop-up, type Google maps, with a box: “The
           Limbo”.

           Sidney displays a schematic map of the prison.

                                           The Mexican government ordered long
                                           ago that communications in the
                                           prison be restricted to the main

                                            And how do they communicate with
                                            the outside? If the operation is
                                            directed from the inside, they have
                                            to have a way of communicating.

                                            It's a mystery. Or there are

20          INT. REGINA OFFICE - MORNING
            Regina is looking into her laptop. On the desk, cups of
            coffee and pills to stay awake indicate that he has worked
            all night, tirelessly, on Baker's case.
            Suddenly LINDA MORRIS ( Judge Morris's daughter , is a

           Regina realizes and laughs without grace.

                                            How did you get away from those
                                            people?
            Linda talks about remembering and reliving in her mind what
            she lived through.

                                                      BEAUTIFUL
                                            I didn't run away. Let's just say
                                            I had a God apart. Lazaro
                                            Mendoza... a bodyguard who worked
                                            for my father... He infiltrated
                                            LaRotunda to save me.
                                            Unofficially.

            Regina wants to know more.
                                                      REGINA
                                            And this man, is he still alive?
                                                      BEAUTIFUL
                                            Yes, of course. After what
                                            happened, he was hiding for a
                                            while.
            Regina is staring at her. Linda explains:
                                                                                                                              CUTTING AND CUTTING:

21          INT. US MILITARY PRISON / CELLAND HALWAYS- DAY
            As Linda briefly tells Regina details about Dante, we see him
            in action:

                                                      LINDA (V.O.)
                                            Lazaro was a marine. He's being
                                            held in a military prison for the
                                            involuntary murder of my father.
            Dante is in a gray, aseptic cell with no windows. Although he
            has a bed, he is sitting in a corner, on the floor, his gaze
            lost. Suddenly, the peephole (a window of a few centimeters
            in the door, also gray, opens.

                                                                              GUARD
                                            Up!
            Dante immediately stands up. The peephole closes again, and
            the door lock is heard. Dante sits facing the wall, at the
            bottom of the cell, with his hands behind his back. A guard
            walks in and puts handcuffs on him.

                                              Play medical checkup.
           The guard leads to Dante, they leave the cell and move down
           the aisle. Suddenly they come to a lattice window, facing
           the outside. Dante slows down.

                                                     LINDA (V.O.)
                                           He is a very brave and very
                                           upright man . And no matter what
                                           the prosecutor says, I know it
                                           wasn't his intention to hurt my
                                           father.
           Dante looks away at the guard, observing that there is no
           problem approaching the window. The guard nods giving the
           go-ahead. Dante approaches the window.

                                                     LINDA (V.O.)
                                           He doesn't deserve to be in prison.
           Dante looks outside , clear skies and trees moving in the
           distance. Close your eyes to feel the sun's rays and the
           breeze on your face. It's the closest you can get to freedom.

           REGINA 'SOFFICE : Regina is writing down everything that
           Linda has finished telling her. He has watery eyes. Regina
           brings her some tissue. Linda dries up and keeps talking.

            Linda smiles in spite of the sadness. Regina observes her,
            cavulating.
                                                                                                                                                                 MELTS TO:

            Dante is sitting, handcuffed to a table, like in an
            interrogation room . It's a small room inside the prison to
            receive visitors alone. The door opens and he looks
            intrigued who comes to see him. A guard puts Linda through.
            Dante's face lights up when he sees him.

                                                      DANTE
                                                (surprised and intrigued)
                                            Linda?

                                            I wanted to come before... but I
                                            still find it hard to be in a
                                            place like that.
            Linda looks at the guard.
                                                      CUTE (CONT'D)
                                            I need a moment alone, please .

            The guard checks that the camera in the corner is on and
            comes out. Linda looks away at the door, and grabs Dante's
            hands .
                                                      CUTE (CONT'D)
                                            I tried to talk to the D.A. to
                                            testify on your behalf, but he
                                            wouldn't admit my testimony.

            Dante repairs Linda's badge . He looks at her surprised.
                                                      DANTE
                                            Do you work for the government?
            Dante looks at the door. Go back to Linda.
                                                      DANTE (COUNT'D)
                                            What's going on?

            Dante gets serious. Linda stands up and looks out at the door
            ajar. The guard puts Regina in.

           Linda smiles at Dante and walks out next to the guard,
           closing the door. Regina looks at the corner camera . Dante
           follows his gaze and also looks at the camera. Suddenly the
           light goes out and stops recording. Only then did she sit in
           front of him.

                                                     REGINA
                                           My name is Regina, and I'm here to

                                           of this place.
           Dante looks at her cautious.
                                                                          DANTE

                                           I need to infiltrate a man in a

                                           whereabouts of a woman.

                                           What woman?
                                                     REGINA
                                           Someone close to the president.

                                           mean a lover.
           Regina looks serious, she says nothing. Dante doesn't
           insist.

                                                     DANTE (COUNT'D)
                                           Why me? The government has no agents?

                                                     DANTE
                                           That means no one will know ,
                                           except you. At least everyone

            Dante shudders to hear his son mention .

                                                      DANTE
                                            Do you know where Pablo and Frida are?
                                                      REGINA
                                            Of course. He's in the care of the
                                            American State in a foster home.
                                            And now I'm giving you a chance to
                                            meet him, once you complete the
                                            mission.
            Dante thinks, quietly. Regina's bidding again.

                                                       REGINA (CONT'D)
                                            It is true that this is a
                                            dangerous mission . But if you
                                            help us, we can grant you your
                                            freedom. You and Frida. And your
                                            son Pablo.

                                                      DANTE
                                            If I survive.
            Regina nods, and they look at each other, weighing the
            situation.

23          INT. GARAGE MILITARY PRISON US - NIGHT

            Dante finishes dressing in civilian clothes . He folds his
            prison uniform and leaves it on his bed. Inspire deeply.
            The door of his cell opens, and a guard comes to look for
            him.
            They're both very serious. They don’t say anything. Dante
            follows him and they leave the cell, they practically don't
            look at each other. The guard takes him through a series of
            internal corridors, to which prisoners do not have access. He
            takes it out the backdoor.

24          EXT. GARAGE MILITARY PRISON US - CONT.
            Dante goes out to an external courtyard away from the main
            facility of the prison. It's a dark place, unattended right
            now. The guard opens a fence for him. Dante takes his first
            steps in freedom. The guard closes behind him and goes back
            to jail as if nothing had ever happened.

            After a few seconds, a van without any badge shows up. A
            sliding door opens. Inside we see the agents who escorted
            Regina to Jeffrey’s house . Dante comes up. The officers
            close the sliding door, and the van moves away from the
            prison.

25          INT. REGINA OPERATIONS BASE - DAY

            It's a place from where Regina will handle the entire
            operation, with very few assistants of extreme confidence.
            One of them is Sidney, the hacker. There's Linda too. On the
            wall there is a cork panel with punctured photos of the
            important prisoners and officials of El Limbo. Among the
            photos are : Adrián Ramos, Tronco, Chillingo and El Sapo.

            An assistant brings Dante in. Regina gets it.

                                                      REGINA
                                            Welcome, Lazarus. You know Linda.
            Linda smiles at him.

                                                      REGINA (CONT'D)
                                            This is Sidney.
            Regina displays a map of “The Limbo” on the table.

                                                      REGINA (CONT'D)
                                            Limbo was built by the American
                                            government. So, it's a strong hold
                                            of the highest security. But the
                                            authorities and the guards are
                                            Mexican. We already know what that
                                            means.

            Dante sees that the agents are smiling at the comment. Dante
            nods. Linda crosses a look of concern with him.

                                                      REGINA (CONT'D)
                                            You're going to come in with a
                                            fake record : your name is Dante
                                            Reyes and you 're an experienced
                                            criminal.

                                                      DANTE
                                                ( missed)
                                            Dante again?
                                                      REGINA
                                            Why not? They say that name
                                            brought you luck in La Rotunda.
            Dante raises his eyebrows. Sidney is amused by the
            explanation. Linda gives Dante a file with her fake record .

                                                      REGINA (CONT'D)
                                            Here's your biography for you to
                                            learn. The idea is that you killed
                                            several cops.

                                           That's good among prisoners, it
                                           gives them respect.

                                                     DANTE
                                               (concerned)
                                           But he falls lousy among the
                                           guards... Or are they already
                                           warned?

                                                     REGINA
                                               (resounding)
                                           No, no. Neither the guards nor the
                                           director of the prison will know
                                           anything. Once you get in, you’re
                                           after yours.

                                                     DANTE
                                           And how am I supposed to survive?

           Linda looks at Regina, worried about Dante.

                                                     REGINA
                                           With your training and your
                                           cunning, Lazarus. This is, no more
                                           ,no less, what you did at La
                                           Rotunda. In a worse prison, yeah.
                                           But you're going to know how to
                                           adapt quickly. Let's go on.

           Regina points with a laser pointer to a photo of the director
           of the prison, Candelaria Mondragón, punctured in the cork.

                                                     REGINA (CONT'D)
                                           The director: Candelaria Mondragón.
                                           Apply hard hand to show that women
                                           can be more severe than guys. But
                                           we think it's bought by the Ramos
                                           Cartel .
                                               (looks at it)
                                           You have to take care of Mondragón.
           Dante nods. Regina points with the pointer to the prisoners.

                                                     REGINA (CONT'D)
                                           Now illustrious inmates : He is
                                           Trunk, an important member of the
                                           cartel... He gives protection to
                                           Adrian Ramos, Chillingo's son.
                                           Chillingo is imprisoned in the
                                           United States, isolated from the
                                           rest of the world thanks to an
                                           American government operation . The
                                           Cartel doesn't love us much for
                                           that reason.

            The agents are smiling. Dante looks at them with a certain
            contempt.

                                                      REGINA (CONT'D)
                                            Your mission is to get close to
                                            Trunk and Adrian. They're the ones
                                            who have the key to rescuing our
                                            target.
                                            But they don't accept new members
                                            in their clan. They only have one
                                            alliance with another prisoner, El
                                            Sapo.
            Regina points to the Toad with her laser pointer. Dante
            looks at him and looks through the dismal faces of the
            prisoners in the cork. Try to process as much information
            as you can.

                                                      DANTE
                                            The Toad, Trunk, Adrian Ramos.
                                            Okay. What else do I have to
                                            know?
            Regina crosses a look with Linda. There's something they
            don't tell you .

                                            Once inside, someone else will
                                            contact you . It's going to help
                                            you investigate and it's going to
                                            be the link between you and us.
            Dante cares about the news.

                                                      DANTE
                                            Who is it? Anyone here?

                                            carries twice the risk of being
                                            discovered.

                                                      REGINA
                                            It's all a risk in this operation.
                                            But it’s the only option there is.
            Dante accepts it , and he doesn't reply. Look again at the
            map and the photos on the cork. For him, the mission has
            already begun.

26          I/E.TRANSFER TRUCK /ROUTE TO “EL LIMBO” - DAY

            It's another day. A prison truck is moving along the route.
            Inside the truck, Dante is taken along with other Latino
            prisoners to “El Limbo” prison. Dante is quiet, watching

           Several prisoners laugh. Not Dante. Peter is intimidated by
           everyone except Dante. He bends to talk to him.

                                                     PETER

                                           is my old lady's name. My old

           Dante looks at him without understanding. Peter explains
           himself.

                                           Is this your first time in the grave?
           Dante denies, barely. He's not here to sympathize with
           anyone.

                                                     PETER (COUNT'D)

           Dante shut up. Peter insists, he's so nervous he won't stop.

            Dante looks at him seriously. Peter is quiet, now also
            intimidated by Dante. Dante looks out the window. We see that
            the truck goes into El Limbo.

27          INT. THELIMBO/ INCOME SECTOR- DAY
            Dante enters with other prisoners. They're passing in line.
            Pedro stays next to Dante, nervous. Later, TRUJILLO (45),the
            chief of guards, supervises, while other guards strip the
            prisoners. A doctor checks them, makes them bend over and
            cough.

                                                      PETER
                                            Are they going to strip us off? Fucking mother.
                                            Isn't that against our rights?
                                                (look around)
                                            No one's going to say anything?
            Later on, Trujillo will shut them up.

                                                                           TRUJILLO
                                            Silence!
            Peter speaks lower, always with reference to Dante.

                                                      PETER
                                            I was told that the first night the

            He gestures to be raped. Dante looks at him and he's still
            quiet. You notice him dead of fear. Peter does not stop
            looking at what happens later in line, with prisoners already
            naked.

                                                      PETER (COUNT'D)
                                            You're going to look good
                                            on my sneakers.

                                                      DANTE
                                            Stay quiet and nothing's going to
                                            happen to you .

            They both look forward where one of the prisoner’s braids with
            a guard and another turns him around with a stick. Peter
            shudders. Prisoners are getting ahead until Dante and Pedro's
            turn comes . Trujillo and Dante look serious.

                                                      TRUJILLO

            Dante and Pedro undress stand against the wall and are
            checked by the guards and the doctor. By his gestures we
            understand the disgust of the situation. They pass the check-
            up.

                                                                           DOCTOR

            Pedro takes his clothes and dresses. Dante is going to take
            his pants, but Trujillo is stepping on his hand. He keeps his
            hand on his feet while he talks to his subordinates.

                                                      TRUJILLO
                                            This one seems to like killing
                                            cops. Let's see if we take the
                                            habit out of it.

                                            You're coming with us, Dante Reyes.
            Dante looks at him. Two guards appear flanking Trujillo.

28          INT. THELIMBO/ SHOWER- DAY

            Dante, naked, is pushed by two guards who support Trujillo.
            Others watch that no one enters the place. Guards hold Dante
            while Trujillo hits him in the face and lower abdomen. Dante
            tries to cover himself as he can.

                                                      DANTE
                                            Stop, please!
            The guards release him, and Dante falls to the floor. There
            between the three they kick him until Trujillo brakes
            everyone's action .

                                                                           TRUJILLO
                                            Well!
            Dante coughs and bleeds on the floor. Trujillo is coming up
            to him .

                                                      TRUJILLO (CONT'D)
                                            We didn’t kill you because the
                                            director asked us to keep the
                                            dead quota down this month. See
                                            you next month .
            Trujillo spits it out and goes out with his guards. Dante is
            naked and sore on the floor.

29          INT. THELIMBO/ PATIO- DAY

            Dante goes out into the yard, naked and bruised by blows. He
            covers his genitals and walks while other inmates look at him
            intensely. Something staggering, Dante advances between them.
            Find a rope in clothes and take a prisoner's uniform . He
            begins to dress, but then he is approached by the owner of
            that uniform and other prisoners who accompany him. The
            leader of the group is RODRIGO (25), cousin of Pedro. There
            is also the RAT PAEZ (25).

                                                      RODRIGO
                                            What are you doing? That's mine.
            Dante looks at him. Try to reason without conflict.

                                                      DANTE
                                            The guards took everything out of me.
                                                      RODRIGO
                                            And what about me?
            Rodrigo smokes and throws smoke in his face.

                                                      DANTE
                                            I'm asking you for a hand, that's all
                                            . When I get clothes, I’ll give them
                                            back to you.

                                                      RODRIGO
                                            No, you better give it back now.
            Rodrigo supports his front against Dante's. Everything
            indicates that you will have to braid yourself with blows.
            Peter appears and intervenes.

                                                      PETER
                                            Hey, Primo, this one just came in
                                            with me, it's good.
            The plan opens and Dante sees Peter. He recognizes it.
            Rodrigo doubts.

                                                      RODRIGO
                                            Why don't you give her your clothes?
                                                      PETER
                                            Come on, didn’t you always tell me
                                            that there's camaraderie between
                                            tumbers ?

            Rodrigo smiles with irony. Look at Dante from top to bottom.
                                                                           RODRIGO

                                                      RODRIGO (COUNT'D)
                                            You owe me one. And thank my

            Dante nod, parco. Rodrigo goes out with everyone but Pedro.

                                                      PETER
                                            You don't have to thank me .

            Dante stares at him . Peter gets
            intimidated. Spend from time to night:

30          INT. THELIMBO/ SAPO Pavilion- NIGHT
            El Sapo (55), morbid obese with an emperor's air, sits on an
            imposing throne made of pallets, with wheels on the sides.
            It is massaged by two “subjects” who smear the body with oil.
            Meanwhile, he kisses one of his pigeons.
            He has other pigeons in several cages. Near him, MAXIMO (29),
            a strong fighter, trains box by hitting a bag with power.

                                                      TOAD
                                                (to the dove, affectionate)
                                            Hey, baby. Come give me a kiss. How
                                            beautiful you are.
            Toad speaks to his subjects.
                                                      TOAD (CONT'D)
                                            I'm thankful. Despite living among
                                            all these damned unhappy, I can
                                            enjoy these cherubim, full of
                                            purity that illuminate my heart.
                                            Quite a symbol. A symbol of peace,
                                            isn't it? Freedom...

            Nobody answers him , they look at him with great respect and
            fear.

                                                      TOAD (CONT'D)
                                            But besides, for me they symbolize
                                            something else. Loyalty. They’re
                                            free, but they're loyal. They
                                            always come back to me. And they
                                            don't lose anything on the way.
            Everyone looks at him, with respect.

           No one answers. Maximus is still training. The Toad,
           suddenly, faces one of his assistants, whom he has nearby .
           He grabs him by the ear, and he squeezes his nose. The other
           one doesn't move.

                                           the ring, against Maximus, today.

           Maximum gives the bag with everything. The prisoner is
           terrified.

           The Toad ignores it and rings a little bell.

                                           Max, come on. Break his head.
           Maximus goes over the young prisoner to beat him up. The
           prisoner gets scared and retracts. Pray for his life.

                                           never again!
           Maximus grabs him by the shirt. The toad rings the bell.

                                                     TOAD
                                           That's it, Maximus.

            Toad patches his face, while he laughs, tempted. The rest
            begin to laugh following the joke, even the threatened
            prisoner. VERB, right hand of the Toad, enters the pavilion.

            the throne with ropes and wear it as if he were a king.
            PARALLEL MOUNTING

31          INT. ELLIMBO/ NIGHT
            Prisoners are getting ready to see a fight. When he arrives,
            the Toad greets when he passes as if he were a celebrity.
            Other prisoners greet him with respect and fear. El Sapo
            crosses a look of mutual respect with TRUNCO and ADRIÁN
            RAMOS, sitting in the stands. They don't feel afraid of the
            Toad like the others. They are also surrounded by their
            entourage of “heavy” thugs.

            Adrian is silent in respect of Tronco, although he is clearly
            in disagreement with that decision.

32          INT. ELLIMBO/ DIRECTOR- NIGHT

            Director MONDRAGON observes by the monitors the preview of
            the fight in the grandstand sector . He sees the excitement
            of the prisoners over the imminence of combat. Next to him
            is Trujillo, who stands firm and drives with great respect.

                                                      MONDRAGON
                                            You want to tell me what the hell is
                                            going on out there?

                                            It's the fight of the Toad fighter.
                                                      MONDRAGON
                                            And who the hell authorized it?

            Mondragón denies obfuscated.

                                            Imagine that this is a nature

            Trujillo nods. Mondragón looks at the fight to begin.

33          INT. THELIMBO/ FIELDS SECTOR- NIGHT

            Verb comes out of the burning and expectant crowd and
            presents the fighters in the middle of an improvised ring.

            Another prisoner ends up taking from the crowd old and undone
            bills that are the bets on the fighters.

                                                      VERB (CONT'D)
                                            On the one hand we have the
                                            champion, a heavyweight, sponsored
                                            by the Toad, undefeated in the
                                            last twenty-seven fights, he is:
                                            Maximum!
            Maximus comes out of the crowd that cheers on him. Raise your
            hands and greet your swollen.

                                                      VERB (CONT'D)
                                            And on the other corner, the

                                            everything to taste his eggs, to
                                            leave behind his crappy pavilion
                                            and earn a place to the right of
                                            the Toad. With you: La Rata Paez!

            The “Rat” Paez, marked, with tattoos, comes out from the
            opposite side and the podium of the common prison population
            explodes. The Rat Paez greets while they cheer him. A common
            prisoner passes by a cartel that says, “only round.” And the
            fight begins.

            Max takes a few strokes, but La Rata manages to dodge them.
            Maximus corrases him and manages to give him a few tubs. The
            Rat kicks him and makes him fall. From there, Maximus kicks
            his knee and the Rat falls. Maximus wants to step on it, but
            the Rat sneaks on the floor until he gets up. They're back
            in the fight.

            Toad observes compenetrated in the fight. Celebrate the blows
            with bloodthirsty delight.
            The Rat hits Maximus but he resists blows well. He lets
            himself hit. Suddenly, Maximus hits him in the face and the
            Rat is staggering.

            Watching prisoners yell at the Rat to react, but it's late.
            Maximus cornered him against a column and hit him until he
            falls. Then he lifts it from the hairs and takes it to the
            middle of the makeshift ring . Maximus looks at the Toad
            waiting for his verdict.
            The Toad looks around , drawing inspiration from the popular
            clamor. Several ask for the life of Rata Paez, among them
            Rodrigo and his band. But more than half the prison is asking
            for death . Toad raises his hand and... lowers his thumb.
            So, Maximus beats off his opponent. The Rat dies on the spot,
            in everyone's sight.
            IN THE STANDARDS: Pedro and Rodrigo, along with other young
            men, tremble at the end of the friend. Adrian shows contempt
            for the figure of the Toad. Trunk looks at everything
            seriously.

            IN THE DISPLAY: The director gets angry at seeing what is
            happening on the monitors, and comes off , followed by
            Trujillo.

            IN ONE OF THE CORNERS, HIDDED FROM THE CROWN: Dante ha
            watched everything. See how they take the toad, laughing and
            macabre.

                                           My dear director Mondragón, you
                                           haven't been seen in the village
                                           for a while . I thought he 'd
                                           forgotten about us.

           Trujillo looks badly at the Toad's minions . Mondragón
           doesn't hide his moody.

                                           Tell me, Toad, are you a jerk?
           The Toad looks at her somewhat surprised.

                                           Uh... How an imbecile? I thought

                                           tongue.
           Mondragón looks at him serious. Verb serves him beer. She
           rejects it.

                                                     MONDRAGON
                                           He's the second dead this month. I
                                           can't explain any more quarrel
                                           deaths, Toad.

                                                     TOAD
                                           What a pity, the quota was filled.
           Toad treats her with reluctance. He laughs.

                                                     TOAD (CONT'D)
                                           The quota was filled with dead
                                           people in El Limbo. He's bothered
                                           by the dead, he says.
           Toad laughs with Maximus and Verb. Go back to her,
           seriously.

                                           These dead are helping you pay for
                                           the house, the car, your
                                           granddaughter’s school , the
                                           Caribbean vacation . Because when
                                           there are dead, you pay better.
           Mondragón smiles ironic. Look at the money they're counting.

                                                     MONDRAGON
                                           This is only going to bring us
                                           trouble, Toad. You have to be a
                                           little smarter.
           Mondragón threatens him between the lines. Toad looks at her
           seriously.
                                                     MONDRAGON (CONT'D)
                                           If you want to continue to be the
                                           one who does the “collect”, you're
                                           going to have to do more. The money
                                           is with the living, not with the
                                           dead.
           Toad feels humiliated before his people. He reacts badly.

                                                     TOAD
                                           Are you threatening me, you crappy
                                           ? Do you know how many directors
                                           I took before you got there?
           Mondragón doesn't shrink.

                                                     MONDRAGON
                                           Oh, yeah? Luckily, I’m a director.

           The Toad remains fora moment without knowing what to answer,
           surprised by the answer. Then he laughs, celebrating the
           occurrence, and then again takes a threatening stance.

                                                     TOAD
                                           Do you want to measure your dick
                                           with me? Just measure it. But I'll
                                           tell you one thing: the officials
                                           pass, and my business is left.

                                                     MONDRAGON
                                           Go to the hooker who gave birth to you.
           Mondragón gestures to Trujillo and leaves followed by the
           guard.

                                                      TOAD (CONT'D)
                                            You want me to send one of my
                                            soldiers tonight to help you fall
                                            asleep ?
            Mondragón gets obfuscated. Trujillo follows her. The Toad
            laughs:

                                                      TOAD (CONT'D)
                                            Now he does not, but he's missing
                                            a good poronga!
            Everyone laughs, complacent. They turn up the music again.

35          INT. DEPT. FRIDA- NIGHT
            In a furnished apartment, uninhabited. Frida enters, followed
            by Regina. They're accompanied by a couple of agents. Frida
            brings a little suitcase. She looks unimproved. It’s
            notorious they just got her out of jail. Regina gives Frida
            the keys to the apartment.

                                                      REGINA
                                            All yours, Frida.
            Frida keeps quiet.                                            Regina leaves him a bag of clothes and a
            cell phone.

                                                      REGINA (CONT'D)
                                            You have nothing to worry about.
                                            You're going to introduce yourself
                                            to El Limbo tomorrow, and the
                                            official version is that you were
                                            on leave after the closing of La
                                            Rotunda. And it's time for you to
                                            get back to work. This cell phone
                                            has my number on it.

            Frida looks around and faces Regina with a question.

                                                      FRIDA
                                            Where is Pablito? You told me I could
                                            see it.

                                                      REGINA
                                            The boy is fine. He's going to meet

                                            You can bring him here, if this
                                            place is mine. I can keep raising
                                            him. He needs to be with his
                                            family.

                                            You're not understanding. You can't
                                            have it here because you're not

            Frida is contained. He has no other left to accept. Nod.

            Regina goes out with the agents. Frida is alone, look at the
            place, a little overwhelmed.

36          INT. THELIMBO/DANTECELL- NIGHT

            Dante has settled between the outcasts and the newcomers. He
            lies on his bed, still somewhat sore from the beatings of the
            guards. Pedro approaches, who got something strong to drink
            in a plastic bottle cut in half.

                                                      PETER
                                            Is there a drink, mate?
            Dante agrees. Drink. He sighs. His ribs hurt.
                                                     PETER (COUNT'D)
                                            Does it hurt?

           Dante nods. Give her the bottle back. Peter lifts her up.

           Pedro drinks and gives Dante another drink . Dante rejects
           him .

                                                     DANTE

                                           Of nothing.
           Dante is quiet. Peter observes it.

                                                     PETER (COUNT'D)
                                           Talking isn't your thing, is it?
           Dante twists a smile. Deny with a parco gesture.

                                                     PETER (COUNT'D)
                                           I do. I talk nonstop . And when I'm
                                           nervous, twice as much.

                                                     DANTE
                                           I think you already told me.
           They laugh.

                                                     DANTE (COUNT'D)
                                           In these places, silence is the best
                                           ally.
           Peter assimilates what Dante said to him.

                                                     PETER
                                           I ranch with my cousin. I was lucky
                                           to fall where he is. Otherwise, I’d
                                           be a stiff.
           Dante gets serious again.
                                                     DANTE
                                           Don't get confused, Pedro. Here,
                                           everyone is for their own.
           Dante looks at the pavilion. Peter stares at him, his air of
           mysticism is magnetic to him, although he can 't figure it
           out. The lights go out and the guards start doing the
           round. Pedro signs a farewell to Dante
                                                                      an
           d leaves, unseen by the officers. Dante lies down but does
           not close his eyes .

            Spend time to next day:

37          INT. DEPT. FRIDA- DAY

            It sounds an alarm. Frida turns it off , but she's already
            up having a coffee. In successive cuts we see her bathing,
            dressing, combing, putting on hoops and barely making up. On
            her cell phone, a message: there's a van waiting for her
            outside. Frida is ready for her new mission.

38          INT. THELIMBO/ PATIO- DAY
            It sounds cumbia in a radio in the yard. Dante washes his
            face in outdoor pools . He looks through the prison
            environment. Look from afar at Adrian and Trunk, who walk
            through the courtyard as the owners of the place. Beyond
            that, Pedro, Rodrigo and other young prisoners play a
            basketball game . The ball hits the hoop and comes to
            Dante.

                                                      RODRIGO
                                            Hey, pass it!
            Dante sees the ball and takes it. Rodrigo is coming up with
            Pedro.

                                                      PETER
                                            We're missing one.
            Dante nods. DIRECT CUT TO: Dante plays with the unclassed
            prisoners, along with Pedro and Rodrigo. We see Dante 'steam
            basks, party. Suddenly, Adrian breaks into the match with
            his heavy entourage.

                                                      ADRIAN
                                            The game is over, faggots!
                                            Clear the court!
            Dante pays special attention. There are certain gestures of
            protest, but no one claims. They know they can't stand up to
            Adrian. Dante has the ball. Adrian faces it .

                                                      ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                                            Give me the ball. What are you waiting for?
            Dante takes a moment to think. He knows that Adrian is one of
            his goals, he has to earn his respect.

                                                      ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                                            Are you deaf?

                                                      DANTE
                                            No. Excuse me.
            Dante gives him the ball back. Adrian grabs her and looks at
            her wrong.

                                                      ADRIAN
                                            You're the one who made the guards
                                            angry ?
                                                (mocking)
                                            Theydon 't like cops at all.

            Dante responds, measured.

                                                      DANTE
                                            I want to keep playing.
            Adrian looks at him trying to figure it out.

                                                      ADRIAN
                                            For now, I have the full team, I
                                            don't need any new players.
            And he goes with the ball.
            Dante returns with Rodrigo and Pedro. But now it turns out
            that Rodrigo has been offended with him.

                                                      RODRIGO
                                            Where are you going?     If you
                                            want to play with the Cartel, go
                                            play with the Cartel.
            Peter looks at him and shrugs his shoulders. Dante scored
            points with Adrián and subtracted with Rodrigo.

39          INT. THELIMBO/ INCOME SECTOR- DAY

            Frida just entered Limbo, with her executive suit and
            briefcase.
            Mondragón will receive her, escorted by Trujillo.
                                                      MONDRAGON
                                            Frida, I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
                                            Mondragón Candelaria.

            Mondragón extends his hand and Frida narrows it .
                                                      FRIDA
                                            Good pleasure.

                                                     MONDRAGON
                                           It's just that when I have to take
                                           a civil servant on my payroll that
                                           I didn't even have the chance to
                                           interview, it's not easy for me.

           Frida, a little puzzled, adheres to his instructions.

                                                     FRIDA
                                           I didn't mean to go through
                                           anyone's top . I just asked to go
                                           back to work, they told me there
                                           was a vacancy here. It was a
                                           surprise to me, too.

           Mondragón breaks her.

                                                     MONDRAGON
                                           The less explanations, the
                                           better.
                                               ( points to Trujillo)
                                           Trujillo, my trusted man .                                                           Come
                                           on, I’ll show you the
                                           facilities.

           Frida greets Trujillo with a gesture and follows them .

                                           Limbo has three blocks. Blocks A, B
                                           and C, each with their respective
                                           pavilions.

           Frida nods. He’s looking all around. On the way they cross
           some prisoners, who watch her intrigued.

                                                     MONDRAGON (CONT'D)
                                           In blocks A and B are prisoners
                                           who have good behavior. They enjoy
                                           some privileges because they help
                                           us keep the rest of the

                                           But they don't drive themselves, I
                                           imagine.

                                                     MONDRAGON
                                           No, of course. The only one who
                                           runs the prison here is me. And
                                           guard with the poor unhappy man
                                           who dares to defy very authority,
                                           don't you, Trujillo?

            Mondragón and Trujillo laugh accomplices. Frida observes them
            quietly, staying a little out of the code they share.

                                                      MONDRAGON
                                            Block C is the largest , where most
                                            of the pavilions are . The common
                                            prison population. The beasts,
                                            speaking badly and soon.
            Frida listens to her with discomfort. Follow Mondragón and
            Trujillo through the corridors and see how everything works
            .

40          INT. ELLIMBO/ SAPO- DAY

            Trunk is waiting for someone, impatient. The place is a kind
            of telephone “switchboard” adapted to the prison universe.
            From there, prisoners of the Sapo gang operate computers and
            telephones. They do business with abroad , communicate with
            victims of extortion kidnappings, etc. There are a couple of
            prisoners doing these kinds of calls:

                                                      PRISONER SWITCHBOARD 1
                                                (on the phone)
                                            If you want to see your son again
                                            , this is what you 're going to
                                            do. You're going to grab a bag,
                                            you’re going to put fifteen
                                            thousand dollars in, and you're

            Adrian arrives disheveled and sweaty, for having played
            football . Trunk looks at him with reproach.

                                                      ADRIAN
                                            I would have been a basketball star.

            Trunk looks at his watch. Just snap your fingers. The
            prisoner speaking on the phone understands the message and
            hurries the call:

            The prisoner comes out, with respect. Trunk and Adrian are
            alone. Adrian took a look at the place, the electronic

            Trunk 's not responding. It's part of his personality. He
            only talks when there is something, he considers important,
            or in front of direct questions. He almost does not comment.
            He pulls out the fax they just received and shows it to him.
            There you see a picture of Regina, taken incognito, while
            receiving the flash drive in her mailbox.

            Adrian looks at the picture and smiles. Trunk concentrates on
            photography.

            Mondragón's tour goes to Frida's office .                                                                                           Trujillo stays at
            the door, gives them room to talk.

                                            This is your place. It's not a big
                                            deal, but I think you’re going to
                                            know how to take advantage of it.
                                            You give me that impression.

                                                      FRIDA
                                            Which one?

                                            right? And you have good contacts.
            Frida looks away at Trujillo. He stays away and doesn't get
            in. Mondragón has almost cornered her against her desk.

                                                       MONDRAGON (CONT'D)
                                            It's all right. They asked me to
                                            receive you, and I'd rather be
                                            owed a favor than me. But better,
                                            from now on, let's avoid the
                                            surprises.
            Frida is uncomfortable.

                                            Don't worry, that's not going to happen.

            Mondragón points to him several files on his desk and comes
            out. Frida opens some randomly, until she finds the file of
            DANTE REYES. Look at her photo with impact . He opens
            another file, and he shudders. It is the one of MARIANO
            TAVARES, and next to it, the file of SANTITO. Mondragón
            reappears and takes her out of his self-esteem.

            Frida hesitates. Mondragón looks at her impatiently.

            Mariano Tavares and Santito enter along with other prisoners,
            who are made naked by the guards . Santito has a slight limp,
            product of the shots he received at the end of season 1. It
            moves with some difficulty. Also, when he speaks, he gets
            stuck a few words and stutters. He expresses himself with
            difficulty and frustration, and a nervous tic appears in his
            eyes when he spits out words.

            Tavares is patient when Santito takes his time to talk. He
            puts a hand on the back of his head.

                                                      TAVARES

            They reach the guards and begin to undress to be checked. A
            guard pushes Santito against the wall.

            Tavares, who is taking off his clothes, is trying to

                                                      GUARD 1
                                            You shut up, you old bastard.
                                            Against the wall, both of you, come on!
            Guard 1 and 2 push the Tavares against the wall. Santito
            and Tavares, naked, are checked by the cops. We see his
            gestures of disgust. Tavares sighs with frustration.

                                                      TAVARES
                                                (to the guard)
                                            As you see us, we were kings in La
                                            Rotunda.
                                                (resigned)
                                            What a thing , empires and the
                                            bloody custom they have to fall.
            Santito holds himself in front of the hands of the guards. He
            eats them with his eyes, but he holds it.

            A PARALLEL ASSEMBLY STARTS AT THE END OF

44          INT. THELIMBO/ DINING- DAY

            Dante lunches alone, watching the movement of the dining
            room. It focuses specifically on Adrian and Trunk, who have
            lunch at another table.

            From there he sees that Adrian is the one who handles
            everything like a “good boy ”. He makes a joke, and everyone
            laughs. Suddenly, a prisoner starts fighting with another
            prisoner and, inadvertently, beats Adrian and dumps some of
            his food into the tray. Adrian gets up, upset.

                                                      ADRIAN
                                            Didn't you see me, moron?
                                                    REO DINING ROOM
                                            Excuse me.
            Adrian looks at him badly. Throw his food on the floor.

                                                      ADRIAN
                                            What “excuse me,” suck dick? Now
                                            you’re going to eat it. Eat!
            Adrian forces the other prisoner to eat his food off the
            floor. The Ree has no other than to do it. He ducks down and
            starts eating before everyone's eyes. Trunk keeps eating on
            his plate as if nothing happened. Adrian sets a foot above
            the Reo, humiliating him, and shouts as if he was celebrating
            hunting prey . His whole entourage cheers on him. Dante
            observes from afar.

45          INT. THELIMBO/ RIDER- DAY

            Santito and Mariano advance along the corridor, carried by
            the guards. Tavares is moving forward with a bad face.
            Santito looks at him.

                                                      SANCTITY
                                            Cam-biá la ca-ra, godfather. At
                                            least...we're here for lunchtime.

            Tavares desist from answering him. He's watching the whole
            prison. He doesn't like the halls of El Limbo at all.

46          INT. THELIMBO/ DINING- DAY
            Frida arrives along with Mondragón, both escorted by
            Trujillo, to the dining room area, where there is some
            bustle among the prisoners. Adrian finishes making the Reo
            eat off the floor and lets him go. He calms down when he
            sees the director enter and sits down, but the weather
            inside the dining room is hot. Frida looks around the place,
            shudders when he sees Dante sitting at a table, with his
            tray. Dante sees her, too , and he can 't believe she has her
            in front of him. He doesn't understand what's going on, his
            gesture is bewildered. Frida tries to explain everything with
            her eyes ,but it's impossible. You'll have time to talk
            later.

           They're both shaking, they find it hard to restrain
           themselves.   They haven't seen each other in a year .
           Mondragón looks at Frida and the nervous note.

                                                     MONDRAGON
                                           Calm down. Don’t be afraid.
                                           They're worse than in La Rotunda,
                                           but I'm the queen of the jungle.
           Mondragón speaks in an energetic tone.

                                                                          MONDRAGON (CONT'D)
                                           Silence!
           Prisoners keep quiet and paying attention to it.

                                                     MONDRAGON (CONT'D)
                                           I want to introduce you to a new
                                           partner who joins my team today.
           Point to Frida. Several prisoners look at her from top to
           bottom with eager glances. He gets crazy and shouted things
           at him. Dante, awkward. Frida feels harassed but handles the
           situation professionally .

                                                     FRIDA
                                           I am the new Social Reintegration
                                           Officer, and my mission is to help
                                           all of you serve your sentence in
                                           the best way—
           Frida is interrupted. Adrian has approached her. Look at the
           director. Mondragón is awkward, but he doesn't do anything.

                                                     ADRIAN
                                           Adrian Ramos, a pleasure to meet you.
           Adrian looks at Frida with a smile. Mondragón warns you.
                                                     MONDRAGON
                                           Don't go over, Adrian.
           Dante watches everything from his table. Frida avoids looking
           at him. Adrian tries to grab Frida's hand , and she withdraws
           it without letting her touch it. You hear laughter and
           whistling. Dante, from his table, must restrain himself in
           order not to intervene.
           Adrian looks at her smiling one more moment. The tension
           seems to be eternal. But finally, Adrian returns to his
           table, laughing. Frida releases a little sigh of relief. He
           crosses his gaze with Dante, telling him that he is fine.
           There are a few seconds of calm, but then Frida's face
           changes.

            She gets pale. Dante follows the course of his gaze and sees
            two new prisoners arriving to the dining room next to a
            guard: Mariano and Santito Tavares.
            Everyone turns to see them enter Frida, Mondragón, Trujillo,
            Adrian, Trunk. But the most shocked is definitely Dante.
            Santito knows his identity and his presence is a threat.
            Think at full speed what to do. He wants to get up and get
            out of the place. But it’s too late: Santito has seen it.
            Santito looks at Dante and is surprised to recognize him.
            They're both paralyzed, looking at each other.
            INSERT FLASHBACK: In the final chapter of Season 1, Santito
            confronts Dante when he discovers that he is an undercover
            cop in La Rotunda.
            Back in the dining room: Santito raises his arm and points to
            Dante, so that Tavares can see him. Tavares raises eyebrows
            surprised. Adrian also looks at Dante, intrigued because
            Santito points him out. Trunk, Frida, Mondragón, and the rest
            also observe the situation. Dante is on the verge of being
            exposed, cornered.

                                                      SANCTITY
                                            He's here. The son of a pu-taishere.

            Dante is paralyzed, with Santito pointing at him, and all
            eyes on him.

            Before Santito can say anything compromising, Dante throws
            himself on him and grabs him , prevents him from talking.
            Immediately, the prisoners get upset, the screaming begins ,
            and one after the other, they join the fight until it
            becomes widespread. Director Mondragón grabs Frida and takes
            her away from the situation. Adrian Ramos laughs, and next
            to Trunco they put themselves in protection, with a couple
            of thugs covering them .
            Mariano Tavares vocibles against Pastor.
            Trujillo, when he saw that the situation broke, exchanged
            signals with Mondragón, and ordered repression. A group of
            armed guards appears, they throw tear gas and pepper spray.
            While the prisoners calm down , as a result of the beating,
            the guards drag Dante and Santito away

47          INT. ELLIMBO/Hallway Mailboxes— DAY

            Trujillo and other guards take Dante and Santito to nearby
            mailboxes. Dante is adrenaline about the fight, quiet, for
            now he could “disarm” the danger of being ratted.

           Santito instead is upset (with his nervous tic worse than
           ever) screaming that he will kill him . They're locked in
           both mailboxes. The echo of the gates rumbles as they close.
                                                                                     END CHAPTER 1
