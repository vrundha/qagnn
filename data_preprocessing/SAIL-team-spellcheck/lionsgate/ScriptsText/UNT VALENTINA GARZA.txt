    NOTE: Dialogue in Spanish indicated by italics.

    OVER BLACK, crackling. A small, desperate VOICE cries --

                        VOICE (O.S.)
              Please! ...Don‚Äôt!

    Through a smokey haze we FADE UP ON a pair of eyes, tearful
    and frightened. They reflect the orange glow of a fire.
    Slowly, we PULL BACK, REVEALING --

1   EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - DAY (FBD1)                         1

    -- A distraught Latina girl, YOUNG NATALIA (10). Don‚Äôt worry,
    she‚Äôs not being burned at the stake, but she is horrified.

    CHYRON: ‚Äú1992‚Äù

    We continue PULLING BACK to include Natalia‚Äôs mom, CORA
    NIEVES (40s), clearly manic, on the other side of the
    smoldering pyre. She tosses a teddy bear into the fire.
    Natalia‚Äôs face crumples as she watches it melt grotesquely.

                        YOUNG NATALIA
              Mami, stop!

    But Cora herself is a consuming fire -- raging as she makes
    kindling out of Natalia‚Äôs birthday gifts.

                        CORA
              He thinks he can leave you then buy
              you back?! No, no, no.

                        YOUNG NATALIA
              They‚Äôre mine! He brought them for
              me!

    Cora tosses a gift box into the flames as Natalia‚Äôs Afro-
    Cuban half-siblings, ENZO (20) and ADELE (19), walk up. Enzo,
    kind and loyal, assesses the situation. He drops the cake
    he‚Äôs holding and runs to Natalia.

                        ENZO
              Are you okay? What happened?

                        YOUNG NATALIA
              My dad dropped off some presents,
              but he and Mom got in a fight and
              now she‚Äôs burning everything. I
              hate her! I can‚Äôt wait to grow up
              and get far away from her!

    Natalia sobs, but there‚Äôs no time for comfort. Enzo grabs a
    nearby hose and douses the fire.

    ANGLE ON Adele, a bit of bulldozer, confronting Cora.

                        ADELE
              Are you trying to get kicked out
              again? Think of Natalia for once.

                        CORA
              Her dad won‚Äôt turn her against me!

                        ADELE
              No, you‚Äôre doing a great job of
              that all by yourself.

    The fire is out now. Enzo walks up, tries to keep the peace.

                        ENZO
              Calm down, Del.

                        ADELE
              Calm down?! She is burning shit!

                        ENZO
              You yelling isn‚Äôt going to help!

                        ADELE
              Hold up. I am not the problem here.
              You know what -- whatever.
                  (to Natalia)
              Happy birthday, Nati. I‚Äôm out.

    She storms off. Cora calls after her, furious:

                        CORA
              Go! You‚Äôre no good to me anyway!

    As Enzo grabs Cora‚Äôs arm, Natalia pulls a small box from the
    smoldering embers. She opens it and finds a gold necklace
    with a heart charm inside. As she takes in the gift, full of
    unknowable emotions, MATCH TO --

    -- The necklace. NATALIA (38) fiddles with the charm, no
    longer a child. She‚Äôs a woman in charge. We hear it in her
    voice as she FaceTimes with her contractor, LUIS (40s).

                        NATALIA
              No. Two modern farmhouses. Three if
              we can subdivide the lot further.

    Luis, glancing around the lot.

                        LUIS
              There may be room if you go up.

                        NATALIA
              Oh, we‚Äôre going up. Those views are
              money. Call the city and find out
              about any zoning restrictions.

    There‚Äôs a knock at the bathroom door. Natalia‚Äôs husband, HUGO
    (30s), charming and steadfast, enters with their teary-eyed
    daughter, LUNA (12), an old soul (wearing a choir uniform).

                        NATALIA (CONT'D)
              Just a sec, Luis.

    She mutes the call and turns to Luna.

                           NATALIA (CONT'D)
              What‚Äôs up?

                        LUNA
              ‚ÄòIta Lydia tried to untangle my
              hair and now the brush is stuck!

    Luna turns around REVEALING a brush dangling from her matted
    curls. Natalia‚Äôs mother-in-law, LYDIA PAREDES (50s), appears
    at the door. She looks contrite.

                        LYDIA
              Sorry. I raised two boys, I‚Äôm not
              good with girl curls.

                        NATALIA
                  (unruffled)
              Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve got it.

    Relieved, Hugo exits, closing the door. Natalia sets her
    phone on the vanity, rifles through a drawer for detangler
    and a comb, then calmly fixes Luna‚Äôs hair.

                        NATALIA (CONT'D)
                  (unmuting call)
              Okay, can you also get a soil
              report? I want to make sure there‚Äôs
              no erosion on that hill.

                        LUIS
              Yep. Does that mean you‚Äôre ready to
              pull the trigger?

              I don‚Äôt want to be hasty or
              emotional about this. That‚Äôs how
              you make bad investments. I‚Äôll
              check out a few more properties but
              right now, I‚Äôve got to go.

    She hangs up and turns Luna to face the mirror.

                        NATALIA (CONT'D)
              There. Nice and tidy.

    Luna looks at her expertly styled hair and smiles but --

    -- her brother, MAX (8), is anything but tidy as he slurps
    spaghetti beside his ruggedly handsome grandfather, JOAQUIN
    PAREDES (50s), at the counter. As Lydia clears some dishes:

                        MAX
              Do I have to eat the salad?

                         LYDIA
              Yes.

    Lydia crosses to the sink and quickly Joaquin dumps the
    contents of Max‚Äôs salad plate onto his own, wink wink. Max
    smiles but Lydia has eyes in the back of her head.

                        LYDIA (CONT'D)
              And don‚Äôt you dare help him,
              Joaquin. ...Sebastian, you sure
              you‚Äôre good?

    Hugo‚Äôs flake of a brother, SEBASTIAN PAREDES (30s), is at the
    other end of the counter playing a game on his phone.

                        SEBASTIAN
              I had a burger in the car.

                         MAX
              No fair!

    Hugo enters straightening his tie and crosses to Sebastian.

                        HUGO
              Okay, fired off my last email.
              You‚Äôd think after all these years I
              would‚Äôve made peace with being a
              cog in a corporate wheel, but nope.

    Hugo reads into the comment. For some reason, it annoys him.

                        HUGO
              Don‚Äôt start, Dad.

    Joaquin shrugs, ‚Äújust saying.‚Äù

                        SEBASTIAN
              Well, if life as a highfalutin
              architect is too hard you can try
              teaching English lit to a bunch of
              horny high schoolers while your
              eyes water from their cumulative
              pubescent stench.

                         HUGO
              Okay, you win the crappy job
              contest.
                  (then)
              Is Trixie coming to the concert?

                        SEBASTIAN
              I might‚Äôve forgotten to mention it.

                        HUGO
              Has it been six months already?

                        SEBASTIAN

              You go too long after that, women
              start getting ‚Äúexpectations.‚Äù

    Hugo shakes his head at Sebastian as Natalia and Luna enter.

                  (off Luna)
              Well hello, gorgeous!

    Luna acts like she doesn‚Äôt love this. She does.

              Max, it looks like you‚Äôre wearing
              your dinner. Go change your shirt.

    Max looks at his shirt. Sure enough, it has a giant stain.

                        LYDIA
              Aiaiai. Anda, vamos.

    Max follows Lydia out as Natalia fills a water bottle at the
    sink and ticks off a mental list.

    It‚Äôs a cacophony, but a joyful one. Everyone but Luna is off
    key. She tries not to laugh, knows what‚Äôs coming. Hugo creeps
    toward her, fingers extended, and tickles her silly. Luna
    squeals and laughs till she cries. Lydia and Max re-enter.

    Hugo stops at the door to wait for Natalia. For the first

    FLASHING LIGHTS from a double-parked police car. Natalia
    frowns at it as she parks and jumps out. She hears --

                  (shouting, accented English)
              That‚Äôs what they want! To kill us!

    Natalia quickens her pace, dread pooling in her stomach with
    each step. She turns a corner and stops. Holy shit.

    Two COPS have guns trained on CORA (69), who brandishes... a
    knife? No, a letter opener. Natalia reacts instinctively.

                        NATALIA
              Don‚Äôt shoot!

    Without thinking, she puts her hands up and runs towards
    Cora. Startled, the officers swing their guns at Natalia.

                        COP #1
              Freeze, lady!

    But she inserts herself between the cops and Cora -- a human
    shield. And also a target.

              She‚Äôs mentally ill! This isn‚Äôt even
              a knife, it‚Äôs a letter opener. See?

    Natalia knocks the letter opener from Cora‚Äôs hand. It
    clatters on the ground. COP #2 kicks it away.

                        COP #2

              I will.

    Mollified, the cops leave. Natalia takes a girding breath --

                                                               7

    -- And enters. The room is... disturbing: A plate of food on
    a table buzzes with flies; the TV on the floor is covered in
    blankets; the couch where Cora sits has been stabbed in
    several places.

                        NATALIA
              Why‚Äôs the TV on a time out?

                        CORA
              It was mocking me.

    Suddenly, Cora looks contrite. She pats the couch beside her.

                        CORA (CONT'D)
              Sit.

    It‚Äôs the last thing Natalia wants. Instead...

                        NATALIA
              I‚Äôll just clean up a bit.

    She picks up the plate and crosses to the kitchen when
    there‚Äôs a knock. She leaves the plate in the sink and crosses
    to the open door where Gus waits, ruffled.

                        NATALIA (CONT'D)
              Gus, I‚Äôve got my hands full here...

                        GUS
              So do I. Every day it‚Äôs something;
              shouting, telling people off. My
              phone‚Äôs ringing off the hook with
              complaints. Well, I‚Äôm done. I want
              her out in thirty days.

                        NATALIA
              Hold on... I know she can be a
              handful, but I‚Äôve paid her rent on
              time every month for years now.

    Cora storms toward Gus, gets in his face.

                        CORA
              I have rights! You can‚Äôt do this!

              Watch me.

    Gus exits. Cora calls after him.

                        CORA
              Where am I supposed to go?! Come
              back here, you piece of --

                        NATALIA
              -- Mom! Just stop.

    Off Natalia, feeling like a hell-mouth has opened up around
    her, MAIN TITLES.

8   INT. PAREDES KITCHEN - NIGHT (N1)                              8

    Luna and Max are in their p.j.s, eating cookies at the
    counter with Hugo, who pours them each a glass of milk.

                        HUGO
              ...So when she gets here, I want
              you both on your best behavior.

                        LUNA
              We know, Dad.

                        MAX
              How come we barely see her anyway?
              We used to visit her more.

                        HUGO
              Mom visits her. She does her
              groceries, makes sure she has all
              she needs...

                        MAX
              But we don‚Äôt visit. And she doesn‚Äôt
              come over here. Why?

                        LUNA
              It‚Äôs obvious. Mom doesn‚Äôt want us
              spending time with grandma because
              she basically hates her.

                          HUGO
              Luna!

    As luck would have it, Natalia and Cora enter just then. Hugo
    forces a smile hoping Luna wasn‚Äôt overheard.

                        HUGO (CONT'D)
              Hey! Cora, long time no see!

    He hugs Cora then turns to the kids.

               Kids, say hi to your grandma.

                 LUNA                                  MAX
     Hola.                               Hi, abuela.

     It‚Äôs a half-assed greeting, but Cora hugs them each,
     overjoyed. She bends to get a closer look at Max.

                         CORA
               Look at how big you are!
                   (to Natalia, re: Luna)
               And this one‚Äôs a young lady. Has
               she started menstruating yet?

                            LUNA
               Ew! Gross!

               Wait, what?

                         NATALIA
               Okay, time to brush your teeth.

     With a nudge from Natalia, Luna and Max gladly exit.

                         HUGO
               Go spend a few minutes with them.
               I‚Äôll take care of Cora.

     Natalia nods, grateful, and exits. Hugo turns to Cora.

                         HUGO (CONT'D)
               You hungry? I think we‚Äôve got some
               leftover spaghetti...

                            CORA
               Sure.

     He opens the fridge and rummages, while Cora grabs the cookie
     off his plate and polishes it off. Hugo emerges with a
     Tupperware and clocks his missing cookie, disappointed.

                It‚Äôs no big deal.

                          NATALIA
                It is to me. You know I have
                serious FOMO.

                           LUNA
                Please don‚Äôt try to speak kid.
                    (then)
                Do I have to bunk with Max? I can
                sleep on the couch.

                          NATALIA
                It‚Äôs better if you‚Äôre in here.

                          LUNA
                ...Cora‚Äôs not one of those old
                people who needs diapers, is she?

                          NATALIA
                Trust me, your mattress is the
                least of our problems.

      Suddenly, Max runs up and smacks Luna with a pillow.

                          MAX
                Pillow fight!

                          LUNA
                You little brat!

      Luna lunges after Max, but Natalia stops her.

                          NATALIA
                Hey, hey, settle down. Abuela needs
                peace and quiet.

                          MAX
                But I thought Cubans were loud?

                          NATALIA
                Believe me, she is. But she‚Äôs sick
                right now, and when she‚Äôs sick she
                can be...well, mean. She can‚Äôt help
                it, but I don‚Äôt want her to be mean

                Leave that. Have a seat.

      Cora wipes her hands on a towel and sits at the counter.

                When was the last time you took
                your psych meds?

                I don‚Äôt need meds, I‚Äôm healthy as a

                          NATALIA
                You mean stubborn as a mule. Mami,
                healthy people don‚Äôt stab their
                couches. I want you to see a
                psychiatrist who can give you
                something for your...irritability.

                Is this why you brought me here?! I
                may be irritable but I‚Äôm not crazy!

      Cora storms off. Frustrated, Natalia lets out a silent
      scream. She looks at her watch -- her presentation is in a
      couple of hours. She follows Cora into:

                There was an incident at her

      He hangs up and flops back in bed. An arm reaches across his

                Sorry, but I‚Äôve been sleeping over

                knowing I don‚Äôt have papers.

                          ENZO
                So they can gouge you.

                It‚Äôs not gouging, it‚Äôs a nice
                neighborhood. But if it bothers you
                so much I can spend the night at

27    INT. HOSPITAL ‚Äì ADMITTING ROOM ‚Äì DAY (D2)                    27

      Natalia and Enzo sit on either side of Cora, who taps her
      foot frantically. Luna and Max sit nearby playing on cell
      phones when a gaunt CHEMO PATIENT is wheeled in. Max sees her
      and quickly gets up and climbs onto Natalia‚Äôs lap, scared.

                          MAX
                Can we go? I hate it here. It
                brings back bad memories.

      Natalia notices the Chemo Patient and connects the dots. She
      exchanges a worried look with Enzo, then looks down at Max.

                          NATALIA
                You don‚Äôt have to worry about Mommy
                being sick. I‚Äôm fine now, okay?

      Max nods, but his expression betrays his anxiety. Suddenly,
      an ADMITTING NURSE with a chart opens a door and calls out:

                          ADMITTING NURSE
                Corazona Nieves?

      Max hops off Natalia‚Äôs lap and they all stand up.

                          NATALIA
                Enzo, why don‚Äôt you take the kids
                to the park across the street, see
                if the ice cream guy is there? I‚Äôll
                deal with Mom.

      She fishes through her purse, pulls some bills from her
      wallet and hands them to him.

                Are you sure?

      Natalia nods. Enzo turns to the kids.

                          ENZO (CONT'D)
                Alright, let‚Äôs get some ice cream.

                             MAX
                Yay!

      Max grabs Enzo‚Äôs hand and pulls him toward the exit. Luna
      waves timidly at Cora and follows them out. Natalia takes
      Cora‚Äôs elbow and leads her toward the door.

                             NATALIA
                Come on.

28    INT. HOSPITAL ‚Äì ISOLATION ROOM ‚Äì A LITTLE LATER (D2)            28

      A terrified Cora sits on a bed in a stark room. Natalia,
      hovering nearby, uncrosses her arms and takes a step toward
      Cora, wanting to offer her some comfort. But she stops short,
      unsure of what to do and crosses her arms again.

      Just then, DR. HARRIS (40s), white, kind-faced, enters with a
      chart and approaches Cora.

                          DR. HARRIS
                Hi, I‚Äôm Dr. Harris. Corazona?

      Cora just purses her lips.

                          NATALIA
                That‚Äôs her. I‚Äôm her daughter,
                Natalia.

                          DR. HARRIS
                Nice to meet you. Corazona,
                beautiful name. Where are you from?

                             CORA
                Cuba.

                          DR. HARRIS
                    (ingratiating himself)
                Havana‚Äôs my favorite city -- the
                architecture, the food -- I had the
                best ropa vieja of my life there.

      Cora visibly relaxes -- even perks up.

                          CORA
                    (excellent English)
                Oh no. I make the best ropa vieja.

                    (smiles, then)
                Corazona, do you know why you‚Äôre
                here?

                          CORA
                Cora. And my kids think I‚Äôm crazy.

                          NATALIA
                We‚Äôre just worried.

                          DR. HARRIS
                    (to Cora)
                Do you know why they‚Äôre worried?

                          CORA
                I stabbed a couch. That doesn‚Äôt
                make me crazy.

                          NATALIA
                I never said you‚Äôre crazy.
                    (but, to doctor)
                She was diagnosed with bipolar
                disorder when I was in high school.

      Dr. Harris nods and writes something on the chart.

                          DR. HARRIS
                Is she on any medication?

                 NATALIA                           CORA
      She refuses to take it.         I don‚Äôt need medication.

                          NATALIA (CONT'D)
                She was on ziprasidone but I don‚Äôt
                know the last time she took it.

                          DR. HARRIS
                    (to Cora)
                So, you stabbed the couch? Was it
                particularly ugly?

                          CORA
                I stabbed it because they said to.

                          NATALIA
                    (exasperated)
                She watches TV and thinks it‚Äôs

      It‚Äôs Max, wailing with delight as Enzo chases him and a
      giggling Luna around the playground. Enzo pauses to catch his
      breath as Luna climbs up the jungle gym. He looks at Max.

                          ENZO
                How is it you have half the legs
                and go twice as fast?

                Maybe you‚Äôre just old.

                          ENZO
                I‚Äôm still going to get you --

      Enzo lunges for Max who streaks by him.

                          KAREN (O.C.)
                Hey! Leave that boy alone.

      Enzo finds himself face to face with an angry KAREN who pulls
      her LITTLE BOY (8) out of the play area and away from Enzo.

                          ENZO

                          KAREN

                Sweetie, where‚Äôs your mom?

      Direct Pickup. Karen is dialing the police when Natalia walks
      up in time to see Max shrugging out of her grip.

                             MAX
                Let! Go!

      Natalia indicates Enzo. Karen realizes her mistake, but she‚Äôs
      either too proud or too embarrassed to admit it. Instead --

                It is stupid. White people have all

                in the world even though they‚Äôre in
                charge. Anyone different than them
                is the bad guy and they get to stay
                in power and be heroes. It‚Äôs crap.

                          NATALIA
                It‚Äôs wrong. It‚Äôs who a person is on
                the inside that matters. Like they
                teach you at school, Max, kindness
                counts. Right?

      She looks at Max through the rear-view mirror, heartbroken at
      having to explain racism and steal some of his innocence.

                          MAX
                Right. ...But I‚Äôm still glad I
                kicked her.

      Natalia and Enzo try not to laugh, but it‚Äôs useless.

                You‚Äôre important to me, but I can‚Äôt
                keep tiptoeing around pretending
                we‚Äôre not in a real adult
                relationship because it might
                offend someone‚Äôs sensibility.

                          XAVIER
                    (frowns)
                Enzo, I know you want more -- a
                family, kids -- I do too. We can‚Äôt
                have all that right now, but maybe
                a first step would be moving in
                together.

                          ENZO
                    (suddenly hopeful)
                You‚Äôd do that?

                          XAVIER
                Yes. I mean, I can‚Äôt apply for a
                new place with my legal status, and
                you moving in here isn‚Äôt an option,
                but I could move in with you.

                          ENZO
                That‚Äôs not an option either.

                          XAVIER
                Why not? What is it with you and
                your place? I know you‚Äôre not
                running a harem out of there...

                          ENZO
                ...Trust me, you won‚Äôt like it.

                          XAVIER
                I‚Äôll like it if I‚Äôm with you. Just
                think about it, okay?

      Enzo wistfully looks through the window at Hugo reading with
      Max on the couch as Luna does homework nearby. He sighs. Yes,
      he wants that, but something is holding him back.

                          ENZO
                I‚Äôve got to go.

      He hangs up. Off Xavier, feeling the distance between them.

      Hugo gets in bed as Natalia enters from the bathroom.

                          NATALIA
                ...I thought my heart would break
                when I explained racism to Max.

                          HUGO
                We‚Äôre privileged to have avoided
                that talk this long. At least
                Cora‚Äôs getting the help she needs.

                          NATALIA
                And now I can get back to my life
                and deal with things at work.

                          HUGO
                Speaking of which, I got this
                random call from a headhunter who
                wants to put me up for a senior
                partner position at a new firm.

                          NATALIA
                Seriously? That‚Äôs great, hon!

                          HUGO
                I thought so. And it makes sense to
                jump someplace small where I can
                make more of an impact.

                          NATALIA
                ...Of course, you could come and
                work with me and your dad.

      It‚Äôs as if a dark cloud has just floated into the room.

                          HUGO
                So I can spend my days trying to
                right his moral compass?

                          NATALIA
                You act like he‚Äôs a crook.

                          HUGO
                I‚Äôm just saying, he had no scruples
                about cheating on my mom, why would
                his work be any different?

                          NATALIA
                Hugo, he made a mistake a long time
                ago. Forgive him. Your mom has.

                          HUGO
                It‚Äôs not about forgiveness, it's
                about respect. If I can‚Äôt respect
                him, I can‚Äôt work for him. Frankly,
                I don‚Äôt get why you do. You could
                make twice as much elsewhere.

                          NATALIA
                Joaquin‚Äôs always wanted to keep the
                company in the family.

                I‚Äôm sure he and Lydia thought it‚Äôd
                be through you, but you never
                wanted it. You take it for granted
                because it‚Äôs always been there for
                you. I never had anything of worth,
                let alone a legacy to pass on to my
                kids. All I inherited was anxiety
                from my mom and abandonment issues
                from my dad. So yes, the company
                matters to me!

      She pulls the covers over her chest, defensive. Hugo turns to
      face her, but she refuses to look at him. He sighs.

                          HUGO
                As long as you know that you are
                valuable to this family regardless.
                You‚Äôre my wife. And you don‚Äôt have
                to prove a thing to my dad.

      How can she argue with that? She turns and cups his face in
      her hands, pressing her forehead to his. Off these two,
      connecting.

      Joaquin slams the phone, upset. Natalia, walking by with a
      cup of coffee, pokes her head in.

                          NATALIA
                Everything okay?

                          JOAQUIN
                That was Luis. The lot with the
                views you looked at just sold.

                          NATALIA
                That‚Äôs impossible. The lot wasn‚Äôt
                even listed. I found it and looked
                up the owner myself.

                          JOAQUIN
                I guess you weren‚Äôt the only one
                who saw its potential.

36    EXT. HOUSE FOR SALE ‚Äì EARLY MORNING (D4)                        36

      Natalia and Joaquin sip from paper coffee cups as they scope
      out a dilapidated house.

                          NATALIA
                ...It may not look special, but an
                influx of tech companies and an
                excellent school district is
                driving up demand in this zip code.
                This neighborhood has older
                residents who don‚Äôt spend on
                updates, so it gets overlooked. If
                we flip a couple of houses here,
                get some word of mouth, we can
                build recognition with the younger
                set moving into the area.

                          JOAQUIN
                I like your thinking. I‚Äôll have
                Luis look into how much time and
                money the demo would take in case
                we want to make an offer.

                          NATALIA
                I have a few other places I want
                you to see before we land on
                anything.

      Joaquin nods, a little impatient.

                          NATALIA (CONT'D)
                Look, I know this thing with my mom
                set us back but I‚Äôm committed to
                getting this right.

                I know you are. Let‚Äôs go knock this
                out of the park.

      Natalia smiles. As they walk to their cars, we GO TO:

                You‚Äôre wasting your time. She hates

                          HUGO
                I know. I thought maybe this year
                could be different. ...Come on,
                don‚Äôt make me use this against you.

      He holds up the photo of Enzo on his phone.

      Joaquin, Luis, several DEPARTMENT HEADS, and TWO INVESTORS in

                ...People shouldn‚Äôt have to choose
                between the house they want and the
                neighborhood they want. So, if we
                can‚Äôt find and sell them their
                dream home, we‚Äôll simply build it.
                Building homes and building dreams -
                - that‚Äôs our business. The business
                Joaquin embarked upon fifteen years
                ago when he poached a handful of
                guys from Sydney Jones‚Äô crew and
                started this construction company.

      This gets a chuckle from the room.

                Ten years ago, I came on board and
                joined my vision to his. Now I
                present it to you knowing that
                together we can build something
                great. Thank you.

      She clicks off her presentation and is met with applause. She
      smiles as the Investors approach her.

                lot of vision.

      glasses.

                No, sorry. I‚Äôm just thinking about

                with us, then all of a sudden it‚Äôs
                like he has one foot out the door.
                Has he said anything to you?

                Classic Sebastian. Six months into
                a relationship he gets all
                skittish. I thought... I hoped

      phone rings. He scrambles to send it to voicemail.

                          HUGO
                    (briefly looking up)
                Trixie again?
                    (off Sebastian‚Äôs nod)
                Dude, she and Nat are tight. If you
                break it off, you make sure to let
                her down easy. But for the record,
                you could do worse. Eventually, you
                need to settle down.

                          SEBASTIAN
                Come on man, that happily ever
                after stuff isn‚Äôt for me.

      Hugo rolls his eyes. Suddenly, Max bursts through the door.
      He looks around, breathless, but Sebastian hid just in time.

      Hugo points to Sebastian‚Äôs hiding place and exits as Max
      pummels Sebastian with Nerf bullets, eliciting loud cries.

41    INT. PAREDES KITCHEN/DINING ROOM ‚Äì CONTINUOUS (D4)            41

      Hugo enters and finds Joaquin setting the table while Lydia
      stirs a pot on the stove. Hugo peeks under the lid.

                          HUGO
                Whatcha got here?

                          LYDIA
                Estofado. I thought I‚Äôd make
                Natalia‚Äôs favorite to celebrate.

                          HUGO
                That‚Äôs not her favorite.

                          LYDIA
                Well, it‚Äôs my favorite, so I‚Äôm sure
                she‚Äôll like it.

      Just then, Natalia enters.

                          JOAQUIN
                There she is! The lady of the hour!

      Natalia waves off Joaquin, embarrassed, and crosses to Hugo.

                          HUGO
                What‚Äôs up, dopeness?!

      She goes in for a peck, but Hugo scoops her up and kisses her
      in earnest. Luna and Max come running through, followed by
      Sebastian. Seeing their parents kissing:

                          LUNA
                Ew! Stop it!

                          MAX
                Ahhhh! My eyes!

      Max unloads his Nerf gun on his parents. Luna and Sebastian
      follow suit.

                    (squeals)

                But it‚Äôs not a celebration without
                music!

      Lydia pulls up some salsa music on her phone. MUSIC CUE:
      ‚ÄúVIVIR MI VIDA‚Äù by Marc Anthony. As Lydia shuffles over to
      Joaquin and pulls him to his feet --

                          LYDIA (CONT'D)
                Let‚Äôs dance!

      -- Hugo grabs Natalia by the waist and smiles down at her.
      They move to the beat; he gives her a twirl. Then, Enzo
      shimmies into the room with his nerf gun, drawn by the music.

                          ENZO
                Ai! Marc Anthony!

      He tosses the gun and throws some elbows, his flamboyant
      moves drawing giggles from the kids. After a beat, the
      doorbell rings. Natalia extricates herself from Hugo‚Äôs grip
      and crosses to answer it, winded and smiling. Her face falls
      at the sight of her sister, Adele, in no playful mood as she
      asks...

      Natalia, Adele, and Enzo are mid-conversation.

                So mom‚Äôs in the hospital and you‚Äôre
                having a party? Classy.

                -- Whatever. I don‚Äôt care if you
                exclude me from your little shin-

                fact that nobody told me what was
                happening with my own mother.

                          NATALIA
                    (getting defensive)
                Maybe we don‚Äôt tell you things
                because you act like this. For

                No, Adele‚Äôs right. We should‚Äôve

                as showing up and caring for

      Adele shoots Natalia a defiant look, dares her to disagree.

                Fine. I‚Äôm just tired of fighting.

                          ADELE
                Good then. I‚Äôm out.

      Adele exits, crossing through:

      Then, clocking the wine bottle on the counter, she stops.

                But I will have some wine. To go.

                you. Call me back.

                          DR. HARRIS
                Hi. I have an update on Cora. After
                speaking with her and observing her
                this week, I think there‚Äôs more
                going on here than just the bipolar
                disorder. My diagnosis is
                schizoaffective disorder.

                          NATALIA
                As in schizophrenia?

                          DR. HARRIS
                She‚Äôs exhibiting symptoms of both
                schizophrenia and a mood disorder.
                It‚Äôs sort of a combo.

                Not exactly chips and a Coke.

                          DR. HARRIS
                No. But, it explains the voices.

                          NATALIA
                So, it‚Äôs not just the TV she‚Äôs
                hearing?

                          DR. HARRIS
                I‚Äôm afraid not. She‚Äôs currently
                stabilized, but on the whole you
                can expect her condition to
                deteriorate with advanced age. And
                any progress we‚Äôve made will be
                undone if she doesn‚Äôt remain

                You‚Äôve got plenty of room in Casa

                It‚Äôs true. She has her family to
                think about. We don‚Äôt.

                          ADELE
                Well, I can‚Äôt float her. And I

                Not on my salary. And she wouldn‚Äôt
                want to live with me even if I
                could support us both.

                          NATALIA

                wants to be consulted, but I‚Äôm the
                one who has to make things happen.
                She and Enzo aren‚Äôt in a position
                to help financially, and they can‚Äôt
                help that, but it seems wrong that
                my reward for succeeding in life is
                being saddled with this.

      Hugo reads the anxiety in Natalia‚Äôs face. Concerned, he tips
      up her chin and makes eye contact.

                Hey. Stop worrying. If Cora needs
                to stay here a while, it‚Äôs not
                ideal, but we‚Äôll figure it out.

      Natalia nods, unconvinced. She takes a deep breath, tries to
      shake off the gloom.

                          NATALIA
                Sorry, how was your day?

                          HUGO
                Good actually. Madeline called.
                That new firm wants to make me an
                offer based on my portfolio alone.

      Natalia‚Äôs face lights up -- a kid on Christmas morning.

                          NATALIA
                That‚Äôs amazing! Oh my God!

                Don‚Äôt get too excited yet. Let‚Äôs
                see what they offer.

      But she plants a kiss on him, thrilled.

                          NATALIA
                I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll see what you‚Äôre
                worth. I‚Äôm so proud of you.

                    (smiling wryly)
                Just how proud are you exactly?

      He presses himself up against her suggestively. They kiss
      again, sweetly at first, but it quickly smolders into
      something more. Hugo pulls back, breathless.

                          HUGO (CONT'D)
                Are the kids asleep?

      Natalia nods mischievously. Hugo picks her up and plants her
      on the counter. They‚Äôre in a heated embrace when Enzo enters
      with an empty glass. He sees them and stops. Smiling, he
      backs out of the room, so as not to interrupt the lovers.

                So, I talked to Dr. Harris and he
                said you‚Äôd be sent home soon.

      Cora smiles an odd smile and reaches across the table for
      Natalia‚Äôs hand. Natalia pulls her hand away, uncomfortable.

                          NATALIA (CONT'D)
                I was thinking... maybe you should
                move into a nursing home. A place
                where you can get lots of dedicated
                attention. They could help you with

                Mami, Gus wasn‚Äôt kidding about
                kicking you out. Do you know what
                it took to get you that place with
                your rental history? I set you up
                perfectly and you made a mess of
                everything. You can‚Äôt expect me to
                keep bailing you out. I did my best
                to take care of you even during my
                cancer treatment, but I‚Äôm just
                getting back on my feet...

                          CORA
                I get it. It took me a year to
                recover from chemo.

                          NATALIA
                Wait -- you had cancer? When? Why
                didn‚Äôt you tell me?

                burden you with my problems. I
                might have told you after that if
                you were ever around.

                          NATALIA
                Wow. A guilt trip, really? If you

      Cora (late 30s) and Natalia‚Äôs dad, MARCOS (40), argue over

                that you want everything to be

                          NATALIA
                I have some pretty amazing kids.

                They are pretty great.

      Enzo offers her his beer. She takes a sip and hands it back.

                          NATALIA
                When I was a kid, all I wanted was
                to get away from Mom. I blamed her
                for everything wrong in our lives.
                I never considered how hard it
                must‚Äôve been for her raising us on
                her own.

                          ENZO
                It didn‚Äôt help that her taste in
                men was ‚Äúdeadbeat.‚Äù But you were a
                kid. You can‚Äôt beat yourself up
                about that.

                           NATALIA
                And yet... I always thought Mom‚Äôs
                mental illness was the cause of our
                evictions, but maybe it‚Äôs the other
                way around. Maybe the stress of
                being unable to provide a stable
                home for us caused her mental
                illness.
                    (then)
                I told her she should go to a home.

                          ENZO
                What‚Äôd she say?

                          NATALIA
                What do you think? Honestly, I
                thought I‚Äôd be okay with it, you
                know? Just have someone else deal
                with her. Then I thought about what
                Adele said, and she‚Äôs right. I do
                so much for Mom, but it‚Äôs all
                transactional. I‚Äôm not emotionally
                invested.

                Nat, it‚Äôs understandable...

                But it‚Äôs pointless. I‚Äôve been
                avoiding having a real relationship
                with her because it hurts too much,
                but not having one hurts, too. Part
                of me thinks I should just stop
                avoiding her and try understanding
                her instead, but the other part of
                me is terrified -- like I‚Äôm this
                helpless kid again -- and all I
                want is to protect myself and my
                family.

                          ENZO
                If I had a beautiful family like
                yours, I‚Äôd want to protect it, too.
                And you‚Äôre more invested than you
                think, otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt be so
                mad. But you don‚Äôt have to feel
                guilty about that. You can be mad
                at her and still love her. But
                you‚Äôre right, loving someone isn‚Äôt
                always safe.

                          NATALIA
                I just wish I could fix it! If she
                could at least stay in her
                apartment maybe I could get a nurse
                to come in and watch her, but --

      Unbidden, tears of frustration fill her eyes. Enzo puts a
      comforting arm around her.

                          ENZO
                Nati, it‚Äôs not on you to fix this.
                You‚Äôve been managing Mom‚Äôs affairs
                for awhile and you‚Äôre so competent
                it makes it easy for me and Adele

                The point is, you don‚Äôt have to go
                it alone. I‚Äôm here, Adele can help,
                and Hugo -- well, that man would
                walk over broken glass for you.

                          NATALIA
                Yeah, I lucked out with him.
                Xavier‚Äôs pretty lucky, too.

                          ENZO
                I don‚Äôt know -- broke Black dude
                isn‚Äôt exactly a catch on paper.

                          NATALIA
                And broke undocumented dude is?
                You see past his baggage, I‚Äôm sure
                he can see past yours.

      Enzo takes a sip of his beer, unsure. Natalia leans her head
      on his shoulder. They peer into the night in quiet
      contemplation, closer than ever.

      DAY (D7)

      QUICK CUTS of Natalia picking up a few items for Cora:

      -- She grabs some toiletries from the bathroom, tosses them
      in a bag, and walks past --

      -- The linen closet in the hallway. It‚Äôs open and looks like
      it‚Äôs been rummaged through. That‚Äôs odd. Natalia doesn‚Äôt
      remember leaving it that way. She closes the cabinet.

      -- Natalia roots around in Cora‚Äôs dresser, pulls out some
      granny panties, reacts, then quickly tosses them in the bag.

      -- She notices a business card with the landlord‚Äôs number on
      Cora‚Äôs dresser, puts it in her purse.

      Natalia locks the door and walks away from the building.
      Suddenly, she stops. She turns to look at the building,
      considering. She pulls the business card from her purse and
      dials the number. After a beat:

58    EXT. HOSPITAL ‚Äì PARKING LOT/INT. NATALIA‚ÄôS CAR ‚Äì LATER (D7)58

      Cora, looking somewhat better, walks with Natalia to the car.

                          CORA
                I hope I never see the inside of
                that place again.

                          NATALIA
                Me too. And if you promise to take
                your medicine, I think I found a
                way for you to stay in your
                apartment. Then Enzo, Adele, and I
                can take turns looking in on you.

                          CORA
                I told you, I don‚Äôt want to be a
                burden. And Enzo and Adele can
                barely take care of themselves.
                Just last week Adele came to me for
                money to cover her groceries.

                             NATALIA
                She did?

                           CORA
                    (nods)
                That was the day I called the
                police. I wanted them to do
                something to the people stealing
                from my daughter.

      And Natalia realizes this must be what triggered Cora.

                          NATALIA
                Mom, I know what it‚Äôs like to want
                to protect your kids, but I also
                know that if you don‚Äôt take care of
                yourself first, you can‚Äôt help
                them. Right now you need to focus
                on you.

      Natalia opens the car door for Cora, who gets in. Natalia
      shuts the car door --

      Happy birthday!                  Happy birthday, Mommy.


      Hugo and Max rush to hug Natalia. The family follows suit, ad
      libbing their happy wishes. Luna clinks a fork against a
      glass, getting everyone‚Äôs attention.

                          LUNA
                Happy birthday to the best mom. I
                know you felt bad for missing my
                choir concert last week, so I have
                a special song just for you.

      Luna clears her throat cuing Joaquin, who picks up a guitar
      and plays, ‚ÄúLAS MA√ëANITAS‚Äù by Vicente Fernandez.

                          LUNA (CONT'D)

      Natalia looks like her heart could burst with joy. Suddenly,
      to Natalia‚Äôs astonishment, Cora‚Äôs voice, melodic and clear,
      joins Luna. Smiling, she turns to face Natalia.

                          LUNA/CORA

      Joaquin‚Äôs guitar trills announcing a song change. The whole
      family joins in singing the Cuban birthday song:

                          NATALIA
                That was beautiful, honey.

      Then, to Cora‚Äôs surprise, Natalia turns and hugs her, too.
      And in this moment, mother and daughter finally make a
      connection.

      Natalia can‚Äôt hold back her tears, and Cora clings to her
      like a woman starving for affection. When they pull apart
      Lydia is approaching with a cake lit with candles.

                             LYDIA
                   Let‚Äôs eat cake!

      Natalia blows out the candles to more applause. Lydia hands
      Natalia the cake knife. She cuts a slice.

                             HUGO
                   Okay, I don‚Äôt want to steal Nat‚Äôs

                   And it was good?

      Hugo nods. Natalia squeals, excited, and hugs him. Then
      Lydia, Enzo, and Sebastian take turns hugging him and shaking
      his hand. That‚Äôs when Natalia sees Adele slip into:

      Adele opens a drawer at the desk when Natalia slips in

                Mom told me you were short on

                So you could look down your nose at
                me? I think I‚Äôd rather starve.

                          NATALIA
                Look, I know I haven‚Äôt always given
                you the benefit of the doubt, but
                with everything going on with Mom,
                well... I‚Äôm starting to see things

                and I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to

                we‚Äôre different people doesn‚Äôt mean
                I won‚Äôt be here when you need me.

      Adele, who was angling for a fight, doesn‚Äôt know what to say
      to that. Fortunately, Enzo knocks and enters, interrupting.

                          ENZO

                          NATALIA

                Compliments of Lydia. I refused the
                ceviche. I‚Äôm not having that spill

      Natalia steps up and gives him a hug.

                I couldn‚Äôt have gotten through this
                week without you.

                -- Don‚Äôt you dare.

      But Enzo hugs her too, and she hugs him back.

                Why are you being so childish? I
                take that back, when you were a
                child, you would have jumped at the
                chance to work with your old man.

                          JOAQUIN
                What changed?

      Hugo shakes his head, doesn‚Äôt want to get into it. Suddenly,
      Joaquin understands.

                          JOAQUIN (CONT'D)
                You‚Äôre still punishing me for
                cheating on your mom.

      Hugo looks at Joaquin -- he doesn‚Äôt have to admit it.

                          JOAQUIN (CONT'D)
                That was years ago. Get over it.

                          HUGO
                Fine, you want to do this? You
                taught me to put family first, then
                you didn‚Äôt. Building this company,
                the expansion -- you act like it‚Äôs
                for us but when you cheated on Mom
                you proved all you care about is
                you. Your needs, your legacy, your
                ego -- that‚Äôs what mattered. I was
                older than Sebastian, I bounced
                back, but it pisses me off to see
                him sabotage a good relationship
                because he has no faith in love or
                family. You did that.

      Hugo starts to move off, but Joaquin stops him.

                          JOAQUIN
                The Joneses are trying to sink our
                real estate business before it even
                starts. Don‚Äôt you want to stick it
                to those bastards?

                          HUGO
                I already did. I married Natalia,
                Phillip didn‚Äôt. You may be in
                competition with the Joneses but
                I‚Äôm done measuring my dick against
                theirs.

      Natalia walks up, overhearing.

                          NATALIA
                What‚Äôs going on? Why are we talking
                about the Joneses?

      Hugo shakes his head at Joaquin, who ignores the warning.

                Because they‚Äôre the ones who bought
                both properties we were looking at.

                          NATALIA
                    (surprised)
                You think that‚Äôs a coincidence?

                          JOAQUIN
                I think we have a mole. We need to
                be careful about our next
                investment, because if these guys
                find a weakness, they‚Äôll take
                advantage of it any way they can.

      Natalia furrows her brow. She opens her mouth to tell Joaquin
      about the offer she made, but --

                          HUGO
                It‚Äôs still Nat‚Äôs birthday. You two
                can talk shop tomorrow. Come on.

      He leads Natalia away. Off Joaquin, frustrated.

      Enzo walks down the hall and is surprised to see Xavier
      sitting outside his door. He gets up when he sees Enzo.

                          ENZO
                What are you doing here?

                          XAVIER
                I didn‚Äôt like the way we left
                things. Can I come in?

      Enzo considers, apprehensive. Finally, he unlocks the door
      and they enter...

      towers of junk: newspapers, books, clothes and years worth of
      accumulated detritus are strewn everywhere. Enzo is clearly a
      hoarder. He looks at Xavier full of shame, apprehension, and
      fear. Xavier breathes, then looks at Enzo.

                          XAVIER
                You were right. This place could
                use some work.

      Xavier closes the door behind him and steps further inside,
      invested and ready to attack the problem. Off Enzo, relieved
      at finally bringing his secret to light.

66    INT. PAREDES KITCHEN/DINING ROOM ‚Äì NIGHT (N7)                66

      Lydia and Cora are clearing the cake plates when Hugo, Luna,
      and Max approach Natalia with a large box.

                          MAX
                Time to open presents!

      Natalia hops on a stool as Adele, Joaquin, and the abuelas
      gather around.

                          HUGO
                Enzo and I went to Cora‚Äôs place and
                picked these out. I wanted you to
                know you have a legacy of your own.

      Intrigued, Natalia opens the box and pulls out a photo album.
      Natalia flips to the first photo.

                           NATALIA
                Oh my God!
                    (off photo, to Cora)
                Wait, who is she?

      Cora leans over her shoulder and sees a photo a young flapper
      girl next to a photo of a young man in a suit.

                          CORA
                That‚Äôs my mother, Amelia. She was
                very stylish. And that‚Äôs my father,
                Gael, God bless his soul.

      Natalia flips a page and Luna points to a photo of a 50‚Äôs-era
      woman playing a violin.

                          LUNA
                She kind of looks like me.

                          CORA
                That‚Äôs my cousin, Sabina. She was
                musical like you.

      Natalia flips a page and sees a photo of herself as a little
      girl, holding a kitten as Enzo and Adele look on.

                          NATALIA
                Oh my God, Muffin!
                    (to Adele)
                Remember when Mom brought him home
                from work for us one day?

                          ADELE

                I used to feed it with a baby

                             LUNA
                Awww.

      As Natalia flips through the album we see photos of: Natalia,
      Enzo, and Adele sitting on the hood of a car; Natalia and
      Hugo‚Äôs wedding; Cora smiling as she holds newborn Luna next
      to an exhausted Natalia at the hospital; a Paredes Christmas
      portrait; soccer photos of Luna and Max, the photo of Enzo
      asleep in Luna‚Äôs bed. Natalia laughs at this. She feels
      Cora‚Äôs hand on her shoulder and looks up.

                          CORA
                I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt have anything to
                give you.

                you‚Äôre here and healthy. That‚Äôs the

      She turns to Hugo and smiles, full of gratitude. He smiles
      back. As the family continues to laugh and reminisce,
      embracing their happier memories and building a new one...
      Adele‚Äôs phone buzzes. She steps away to answer and we hear:

                No, not yet.

      Click. He hung up. Adele looks at the phone in her hand then
      over at Natalia and the family, conflicted. Natalia looks at
      Adele and waves her over, wanting to show her something in
      the photo album. Adele forces a smile and reenters the family
      bubble. And we slowly PULL BACK on the family, finding joy in
      this moment, unsure of what‚Äôs to come.
