                         MEET ME IN NEW DELHI

EXT. NAVY PIER - DAY

The SOUNDS of Navy Pier are overwhelming. Tourists TRAMPLE
down the pier. The waves of Lake Michigan CRASH below.

And it's here that we meet MEENA (28 and Indian). On her
bicycle, she peddles past the vendors and tour groups -
moving quickly but still taking it all in.

Further down the pier, we meet FREDDY (28 and white). Wearing
a suit and awkwardly carrying a presentation poster and a box
full of pamphlets, he walks out of The Grand Ballroom under a
banner reading NAVY PIER TECH EXPO.

Meena flies down the pier - looking around.

Freddy, meanwhile, stands alone. He looks out around the pier
at all the laughing, happy people. Conference attendees.
Families. Couples.

Lots of couples.

Zoned out, Freddy absentmindedly steps backwards when--

                       MEENA
          HEY!

Meena SKIDS to the left, narrowly avoiding Freddy.

Freddy, surprised, clumsily stumbles and FALLS to the right.

And his pamphlets GO EVERYWHERE.

Meena jumps off her bike, leaning down toward Freddy--

                    MEENA
               (slight accent)
          Are you OK?

Standing up, and wiping off a certainly bruised ass:

                    FREDDY
          My pamphlets--

Meena and Freddy instantly turn and start running after the
pamphlets, as the wind takes them in every direction.

Meena grabs a handful, but Freddy almost instantly gives up.

                    FREDDY
          Actually, screw it. No one wants
          them anyway.
                                                                2.


Now a bit more interested, Meena looks down at the glossy
pamphlet in her hands.

                    FREDDY
          Here I can take that--

                    MEENA
               (reading)
          Lollipop Bop. Pop Lollipops for
          points--

                    FREDDY
               (dryly)
          And unlock secret game levels.
          Available on iOS and Android.

                    MEENA
          You made this app?

                    FREDDY
          I worked on it for my team.

                    MEENA
          You don't seem very excited.

                    FREDDY
          Yeah, I heard the same thing in
          there. But the thing is, I can-- I
          have made apps that'd contribute a
          helluva lot more to the world.

Freddy reaches for his pamphlet, but she pulls it back again.

                       MEENA
          Like what?

                    FREDDY
          You don't wanna hear about my app.

                    MEENA
          I'd love to hear about the app of
          the person I almost accidentally
          murdered.

Freddy tries to read Meena - who simply smiles back.

He nods his head, and straightens up.

                    FREDDY
          OK... So imagine you're a tourist--

                    MEENA
          I am a tourist.
               (beat)
                    (MORE)
                                                               3.

                    MEENA (CONT’D)
          I mean, I'm new here. I'm in
          university.

                    FREDDY
          And what do you think of that
          building?

Freddy points up toward The Grand Ballroom, an early 20th
Century marvel of Chicago's past.

                       MEENA
          It's nice.

Freddy hands over his phone to Meena.

                    FREDDY
          Now, this is just a beta version I
          made, but take a picture of this
          building with my phone.

Meena takes the phone and points it toward the ballroom.

The moment the camera CLICKS -- the screen reads: THE GRAND
BALLROOM - NAVY PIER. Information and stats fill the screen.

                    MEENA
               (reading)
          The Grand Ballroom. Part of the
          original 1916 construction...
          18,000 square feet... Wow.

                    FREDDY
          And it works for any major landmark
          in the city. What do you think? Be
          honest.

                    MEENA
          The technology's impressive. But...

                    FREDDY
          But why do you care about some
          super tourist-y, old building?

                    MEENA
          Right... Why do I care?

Freddy's heard this before. He nods his head. Thinking...

                    FREDDY
          Hundreds of people were married
          here. The ends of wars were
          celebrated here. It’s... special.

Freddy, building up steam, points toward the Ballroom.
                                                                4.


                    FREDDY
          People walk past this building
          everyday. Hell, you were about to.
          And maybe I'm a dork for this
          stuff, but I want people to
          interact with their city and feel
          like they're a part of its history.

He smiles. She smiles.

                    FREDDY
          That's slightly more interesting
          than Lollipop Bop, right?

                    MEENA
          Listen, this is really cool. And I
          can tell you from what I know,
          especially with financing, it’s all
          about passion. This is where your
          passion is. Not this.

Meena hands back the Lollipop Bop pamphlet.

                    MEENA
          So speak from the heart, and you'll
          do fine.

They look at one another. It's that moment where someone
either makes a move, or...

The moment passes.

                    MEENA
          OK. Well, I gotta get going... Bye.

                    FREDDY
          Yeah, see ya.

Meena climbs up on her bike.

She looks back at Freddy, and then peddles down the pier.

Freddy watches her go. He turns to head the other direction--

But then he turns back again to get her attention, except--

Meena is gone.

                    FREDDY
          ... Dammit.

As if in a daze, Freddy walks down the pier.

NEAR THE CRYSTAL GARDENS...
                                                                5.


Freddy walks farther down the pier, looking around for Meena.

                       FREDDY
             Dammit.

ON THE PIER'S EDGE...

Meena is nowhere in sight.

Resigned, Freddy leans against the pier's railing.

                       FREDDY
                  (softly)
             Dammit.

Freddy, once again alone, looks out over the lake.

And as he thinks to himself...

The sound of CRASHING WAVES starts to fade...

And faintly, we hear the sound of STRINGS.

Then HORNS.

Then Freddy looks up. At us.

And SINGS.

Freddy is nearly as surprised as we are as the words flow out
of his mouth. She was beautiful, he sings. She helped him
find his voice. But she got away.

Where's That Girl?

The SONG, which feels straight out of a 1950's Gene Kelly
picture, is about that undefinable gut feeling when you meet
someone you need to know. Someone special.

His voice is at first hesitant, but it soon grows stronger...

With supreme confidence, Freddy turns and faces the crowded
Navy Pier - intent on finding Meena.

Light on his feet, and with a beat in his step, he dances to
a song only Freddy can hear!

Freddy spins around a TOUR GROUP. He ducks under a selfie
stick yielding TOURIST DAD. Looking for Meena high and low.

Seeking higher ground, Freddy hops from a bench onto a
lamppost. Swinging from the post, he looks over the pier.

His eyes light up. He spots Meena!
                                                                6.


But-- She's quickly peddling away from the pier and down
toward Lakefront Trail. Every moment she's farther and
farther away.

And Freddy is heartbroken.

He falls back onto a nearby bench. And as his motions slow,
so does the MUSIC. Freddy will never catch up with her now.

Then Freddy's eyes drift to a nearby vendor. And he instantly
perks up...

ROLLER SKATE RENTAL

Freddy looks from the vendor, to Lakefront Trail, to us...

                                                 CUT TO:


EXT. LAKEFRONT TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER

With purpose, and with the orchestra's STRINGS behind him,
Freddy zooms down Lakefront Trail - perhaps even lighter and
more nimble on skates than he was in his shoes.

He moves fast, with the agility of a dancer - skating left,
right, and backwards - avoiding RUNNERS, MOTHERS with
strollers, and texting TEENS.

Then Freddy spots her!

Meena is just off the trail in a small park area, in front of
Buckingham Fountain.

So Freddy spins around, jumps over a small barrier, and
skates into the park. He finally SKIDS up next to Meena.

Meena turns and faces Freddy.

Eyebrow raised, she looks him up and down (pausing on his
inexplicable skates.) She can't help but smile.

                    FREDDY
          Hi. I'm the guy from before who's
          way too into old buildings. But I
          figure since you're new to town, I
          could show you around. Test out my
          app.
               (beat)
          Maybe go to a movie too?

Freddy pulls his phone out of his suit pocket.
                                                                7.


                    FREDDY
          So I'd love to have your number. If
          not, it's fine. I'll just skate
          away forever, I promise.

Meena looks at the phone. And then to Freddy.

Considering...

But she nods, and takes the phone, plugging in her number.

And as she hands it back to a very relieved Freddy:

                       MEENA
          I'm Meena.

                    FREDDY
          I'm Freddy.

                    MEENA
          Nice to meet you.

She hops back on her bike. Then pauses.

                    MEENA
          Are you going to follow me again?

                    FREDDY
          No. I'm good. Very good.

She takes one final look at Freddy - confused and intrigued -
and peddles down the trail.

Freddy watches her go.

Then at the very moment Meena turns a curve, disappearing out
of sight--

THE MUSIC BLASTS! And Freddy can't contain himself.

He skates around the fountain - feeling lighter than air.

Freddy celebrates the moment, and begins to tap dance (in
skates, no less!)

The MUSIC builds!

The FOUNTAINS turn on!

And Freddy spins around for the big celebratory finish!
                                                                8.


INT. MEENA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Unlike the bright fantasy of before, we now re-enter the real
world, as Meena pushes open her apartment door, with a bag of
groceries in her arms.

Her apartment is standard university student drab. Off-white,
mostly blank walls.

Her phone rings, and she answers:

                    MEENA
          Hi Mummy, Papa. Kaise ho?... Kya
          kar rahe ho?...

As she speaks with her parents, she goes in and out of Hindi.

                    MEENA
          Today?... Went to Navy Pier. Just
          looked around...
               (beat)
          Just by myself. But it was special.

Meena lingers on that last thought, looking off.

And in that moment, she hears the faintest of STRINGS...

She snaps herself out of it.

                     MEENA
          And then I rode my bike home. And
          that's it.

Meena shakes her head as the conversation moves on. She
listens as her mother continues speaking on the other line.

She looks to her refrigerator. Hung by a magnet is a single
photo. Of Meena and her parents. She looks at it...

                    MEENA (V.O.) (PRE-LAP)
          Are you close to your parents?


INT. 'L' TRAIN - EVENING

A sparsely filled train car rides through the city at dusk.

Sitting side by side, Freddy and Meena continue their
conversation:

                    FREDDY
          They live like 10 minutes up the
          road. So yeah.
               (beat)
                    (MORE)
                                                  9.

                    FREDDY (CONT’D)
          But, seriously, we're super close.
          Talk to them about everything
          happening in my life.

                    MEENA
          Did you tell them about tonight?

                    FREDDY
          I would consider this something
          happening in my life. Right?

Meena nods uncomfortably.

                    FREDDY
          And are you close with your folks?

                    MEENA
          I talk to them everyday. But it's
          hard. They're back in New Delhi.

                    FREDDY
          What's it like there?

Meena lights up.

                    MEENA
          Delhi's my favorite place in the
          world. It's vibrant. And crazy. And
          full of life and good food. And
          history. Like India Gate, which is
          super tourist-y... but you'd like
          it.

                    FREDDY
          Yeah. Well, I've never even left
          the country.

                     MEENA
          Why not?

Freddy PAUSES - as if he'd never considered it.

                    FREDDY
          I don't know. I guess I just...
          never took that leap.

He smiles at Meena. And she smiles back.

                    MEENA
          Well... I'm gonna move back after I
          graduate. I wanna modernize my
          dad's export business. Actually, I
          wanna run it. Now, normally it
          would go to the son.
                    (MORE)
                                                               10.

                    MEENA (CONT’D)
          But my brother doesn't want it. And
          I-- really, really do.

                    FREDDY
          Your brother, he's back in India?

                    MEENA
          Yeah. In fact, he just got engaged.

                    FREDDY
          Oh congrats. You like her?

                    MEENA
          I haven't met her yet. Actually, he
          only just met her a few weeks ago.

Freddy readjusts in his seat, weighing his next question.

                    FREDDY
          So... was it... you know... one of
          those...?

                    MEENA
          Arranged marriage?

Meena takes a deep breath, patiently answering a common (and
annoying) question.

                    MEENA
          No. At least not what you're
          thinking. It's definitely less
          weird than it sounds. I mean, it's
          not like they only get to meet once
          before their wedding.

                    FREDDY
          Yeah, cause that'd be crazy--

                    MEENA
          That's how my parents were married.

                    FREDDY
          Cool.
               (beat)
          So how does it work then?

                    MEENA
          He'd go on dates with the girls my
          parents found. Usually recommended
          through friends. Plus, my parents
          passed around his biodata.

                    FREDDY
          His... what?
                                                                11.


                    MEENA
          Biodata. It's like a resume for
          parents to set up their kids. Like,
          my brother's says he's a writer in
          Mumbai. Or mine says I'm studying
          for my MBA.

Freddy PAUSES for a moment, before turning to Meena.

                    FREDDY
          You have a biodata?

                    MEENA
          I didn't make it. My parents did.

                    FREDDY
          So they're out there trying to set
          you up, while you're dating?

But Freddy puts it together almost immediately.

                    FREDDY
          Except, they don't know you date.

Meena, growing serious, gathers her thoughts.

                    MEENA
          They're not ultra-traditional. They
          just don't understand the concept
          of dating. They don't get it.

As she speaks, Meena becomes more animated. More frustrated.

                    MEENA
          And they'll bring up the different
          cultures and values and how people
          will talk. Like this family friend,
          Nidhi Patni, she went against her
          family's wishes, married a white
          guy, got divorced, and I've never
          heard the end of it!

Meena catches herself. She takes a deep breath and continues.

                    MEENA
          What I'm saying is, if I really
          liked someone, and if we got
          serious, it still would never, ever
          work for my parents.

She nods to herself as if to justify her own logic.
                                                               12.


                    MEENA
          This is awkward. And mortifying.
          I'm so sorry. I'm just going to get
          off at the next stop.

As the train slowly BRAKES, approaching the next station,
Meena stands up and walks toward the door.

                    FREDDY
          What if they don't need to know.

The train door in front of Meena OPENS... but she doesn't
leave.

Freddy stands, and walks toward her.

                    FREDDY
          We don't even know what this is
          yet. I know I like you. I know I'd
          like a second date.

Meena turns to face him... as the door behind her CLOSES.

                    FREDDY
          It may not be easy. But what you
          said about speaking from the
          heart... well I want to see where
          this goes. Cause I've got a good
          feeling about it.

And then, as if on cue... MUSIC builds behind Freddy.

And Freddy, with the utmost confidence, SINGS to Meena.

He tells her that when he saw her riding away, all he wanted
was to make her stay...

And going after her, he had one thought.

Let's Give It A Shot

The train lights dim, except for a light directly above
Freddy and Meena - spotlighting the pair as if they're the
only two people in the world.

Meena briefly notices the world changing around her, but
finds it hard to keep her eyes off Freddy.

And then... Meena SINGS.

She sings softly at first, but as she literally finds her
voice, Meena grows louder.
                                                                13.


Her lyrics unveil her own take on the events at the pier. She
says she doesn't even know him. He's just some cute guy who
skated into her life. Should they give it a shot?

And as they begin to sing back and forth, their duet extends
to their feet. They slowly move in step with one another.

Before they know it, Freddy and Meena are dancing, matching
each other beat for beat.

Their pace quickens. He swings around the train's metal pole.
She does the same.

Then they hop up on the train's seats. Their fellow RIDERS
don't bother to look up from their books and phones - as
Freddy and Meena jump, tap, and dance through the train car.

Meena spins and ends up in Freddy's embrace-- just as the
doors to the train once again open at a new station.

She looks up at him, and--


EXT. LOGAN SQUARE - NIGHT

Under the bright bulbs of Logan Theater, Meena and Freddy
waltz down the empty sidewalks.

Fast paced and energetic, Freddy's hand is on Meena's lower
back. Her hand is on his shoulder. He moves her around the
square as if she is weightless.

They slow to a stop. Wrapped up in each other's arms.

Looking directly into each other's eyes.

Then they kiss.

They'll give it a shot.


INT. MEENA'S APARTMENT - DAY

The SOUND of a printer hard at work.

Scissors SNIP at a print-out.

On the refrigerator - next to the photo of her parents -
Meena hangs up a new glossy photo. It's a selfie of Meena and
Freddy from their first date in Logan Square.

Still high from it, she smiles while looking at the photo.

Her phone BUZZES. Meena's eyes light up.
                                                                14.


                      MEENA
                 (answering)
          Hey!

And as she heads off frame, we--


BEGIN MONTAGE:


EXT. NAVY PIER - DAY

Back where it all began, Meena and Freddy ride the Centennial
Ferris Wheel at Navy Pier. We can practically hear him
describing how the Ferris Wheel was invented in Chicago by
George Washington Ferris - and she's not even that annoyed!


INT. MEENA'S APARTMENT - DAY

On Meena's refrigerator now hangs a photo of them on the
Ferris Wheel.

The refrigerator SWINGS open, as Meena and Freddy cook a meal
together. They bump into each other, finding their rhythm.


INT. KINGSTON MINES - NIGHT

They sit at a table in the back, sharing a plate of cheese
fries as they watch a blues concert on the stage ahead.


INT. RAINBOW BEACH - EVENING

Sitting on a beach towel, they look out over the lake to the
dusk-lit city. He holds her in his arms, as they kiss.


INT. FREDDY'S PARENTS' HOME - EVENING

A Christmas tree in the corner. A fireplace warms the room.
Snow falls outside the windows.

Freddy and Meena sit on the floor near the tree, facing
FREDDY'S FATHER and MOTHER. His GRANDPARENTS rest on a nearby
couch.

A sincere, joyful smile crosses Meena's face as she watches
Freddy LAUGH heartily at a joke his father made -- only
interrupted by the surprise of his mother placing a wrapped
Christmas present on her lap.
                                                                15.


EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

The sun has returned. It's late Spring. Graduation Day.

Surrounded by her cap and gown-clad classmates, Freddy poses
for a selfie with Meena as she kisses him on the cheek.

But Meena, distracted, reaches into her gown and pulls out
her BUZZING phone. She motions to Freddy to hang on a second.

Call from "Mummy and Papa".

Freddy knows the drill. He nods and takes a step back. Hands
in his pockets, Freddy looks on as Meena answers the phone
with a big, excited smile on her face.

END MONTAGE


INT. MEENA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The refrigerator is now completely covered with photos.

Standing in the kitchen, Meena surveys the snapshots of her
new life over the past year.

The photo of Meena and Freddy at graduation. Photos of them
playing skeeball at a barcade. With Freddy's family. In the
park as Spring has turned once again to Summer.

Meena takes a moment to adjust the original photo - of her
parents - now moved slightly off to the side.

                    PRIYA (O.S.)
          Hello!

Meena SNAPS out of her stare and looks down at the phone in
her hands. She's in the midst of a video-chat, and her friend
PRIYA is looking back up at her.

                    MEENA
          Sorry, I was just thinking of
          something--

                    PRIYA
               (British accent)
          I said when are you coming back to
          Delhi? I miss you!

                    MEENA
          July. For my brother's wedding.
                                                           16.


                    PRIYA
          And you're still moving back here?
          To work with your dad. Right?

                    MEENA
          Yeah, definitely. I mean, I am
          applying for some jobs here to
          extend my visa. Cause I wanna help
          Freddy get financing--

                    PRIYA
          You're staying for Freddy?

                    MEENA
          No. No, I'm not-- it's more
          complicated than that...

Meena looks off, carefully selecting her next words.

Priya - noticeably - never has that problem.

                    PRIYA
          Listen. We've all had our secret
          boyfriends. I had a lot. Like a
          lot. But now I'm with Basu and I
          love him. It's nice to settle.

                    MEENA
          You mean: settle down?

                    PRIYA
          What'd I say?

                    MEENA
          But... it's different with Freddy.

A smile nearly crosses her face - but she holds it back.

                    PRIYA
          Meena... your parents. They'll
          flip. Just like--

                    MEENA
          Nidhi Patni's parents--

                    PRIYA
          Frankly, I don't understand how
          you've even kept it a secret. You
          two practically live together.

                    MEENA
          I know. My masi visited and I had
          to scrub my apartment of all
          evidence of him. Photos. Clothes.
                    (MORE)
                                                           17.

                     MEENA (CONT’D)
          And yet she still found Freddy's
          electric razor.
               (beat)
          So I said it was mine. For my...
          body hair.

Meena winces in embarrassment and disgust.

                    PRIYA
          So what are you guys gonna do?

                    MEENA
          ... I'm figuring it out.

From behind Meena, her apartment door opens...

And Freddy enters.

Freddy looks up, and upon seeing Meena on a video call--

                      FREDDY
          Oh shit!

Freddy instantly FALLS to the ground.

Meena spins around.

                    MEENA
          It's just Priya.

Freddy, a little embarrassed, stands up and walks toward
Meena.

Looking over Meena's shoulder, he waves to Priya.

                    FREDDY
          Good morning, Priya.

                    PRIYA
          Good evening, Freddy.

                    FREDDY
               (to Meena)
          Hey, I gotta take a call inside.

                    MEENA
          Yeah, go ahead.

Meena and Freddy share a smile.

Freddy waves to Priya and disappears into Meena's room.

Meena keeps her eyes on the door.
                                                                18.


                    PRIYA
          I do like him.

Meena turns back to Priya.

                    MEENA
          Yeah. I like him too.


EXT. CHICAGO RIVER - DAY

The Chicago Line Cocktails and Architecture Cruise slowly
sails down the lakeside coast of the city, as a docent speaks
over the speakers.

On the deck, Freddy steps out - drinks in hand.

He sees Meena, standing at the boat's edge and looking out
over the water toward the city. The setting sun cloaking her
in silhouette.

Freddy pauses a moment, letting the image soak in.

Finally, he approaches, handing Meena her cocktail.

                    FREDDY
          What do you think?

                    MEENA
          It's beautiful. I love it.

                    FREDDY
          We should do this again. Maybe
          bring my parents.
               (beat)
          Maybe bring yours.

Meena turns to Freddy, with a half chuckle:

                    MEENA
          My parents?

                    FREDDY
          I was thinking, I wanna meet them.
          Maybe you can invite them to visit.
          Maybe in the Fall--

                    MEENA
          The Fall? I mean... my visa expires
          in a month.
                                                              19.


                    FREDDY
          Your student visa. But you
          interviewed at all those places.
          And when you get a job--

                    MEENA
          If--

                    FREDDY
          When you get a job, we can finally
          think about... the Fall. And then,
          invite your parents to come visit.

Meena is keeping her cool. Trying to be patient on an issue
that they've clearly discussed many times before.

                    MEENA
          It's not that easy. Once we involve
          them, please believe me, things
          would get hard. Complicated.

                    FREDDY
          See, I disagree. Cause if
          something's meant to be, then it
          will just... be.

Freddy smiles. So incredibly sure of himself.

Meena looks Freddy up and down before taking his arm and
snuggling in closer.

                    FREDDY
          Things will just fall into place
          for us. I really believe that.

They look off as the sun sets over the city.


INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Meena types away at her laptop.

                    FREDDY (V.O.)
          You'll be here in the Fall. So
          they'll be here in the Fall. It'll
          be as easy as that.

Her phone BUZZES. She picks it up.

An e-mail. ON SCREEN we catch the words: "Meena..."
"Interview..." "We regret..."
                                                               20.


                    MEENA (V.O.)
          You're right. We don't need to
          think about it right now.

Meena puts down her phone.

She nods to herself before getting back to her work.


INT. CAR - DAY

Meena rides in the back of a Lyft. She's on her phone again.

ON SCREEN: "We're sorry to inform you that--"

Meena looks away from her phone and out the window.


INT. MEENA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

On her couch, Meena's eyes scan her phone screen.

We don't need to see what it says. We know. More bad news.

                       FREDDY (O.S.)
          What's up?

Meena looks up toward Freddy, sitting beside her.

She almost says something, but decides against it.

                       MEENA
          Nothing.

She smiles and looks toward the TV.

                    MEENA
               (playfully arguing)
          You don't have the pause the TV
          everytime I look at my phone!

                    FREDDY
          What if you miss something?

                    MEENA
          Then we'll rewind.

                    FREDDY
          Then I might as well just pause it.

                    MEENA
          Never pause it. Just play!

Freddy presses play on the movie.
                                                                21.


                    MEENA
          Wait. What's going on again?

Freddy pauses the movie again.

                    MEENA
          I'm kidding! Just play it!

He smiles, and turns his attention completely to the movie.

Meena looks at Freddy...


EXT. MEENA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Moving slowly up a sidewalk, Meena is in a daze.

She's two steps behind Freddy, who is bounding up the stairs
to her apartment complex.

                    FREDDY
          Have you packed yet? Cause you
          don't wanna wait too long.

She follows him inside--


INT. MEENA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Meena briefly pauses at the front door.

                    MEENA
          I need to tell you something...

But Freddy's out of earshot, so she quickens her pace and
catches up with him in the hallway as he keeps walking ahead.

                     FREDDY
          So the flight's in four days. And
          your brother's wedding is in three
          weeks. And then you're back here by
          the 26th--

                     MEENA
          Freddy--

                    FREDDY
          Which, I know, makes you nervous.
          But you'll have ten days to find a
          job before the visa expires--

                    MEENA
          I need to tell you something--
                                                               22.


                    FREDDY
          Then we're all set.

Freddy finishes speaking as he arrives at her doorstep.

At her door, Meena turns the key in the lock, and partially
opens the door.

She then pauses, keeping the door ajar.

                    MEENA
          I really, really need to tell you
          something...

                    FREDDY
          What is it? What's going on?

Now worried, Freddy moves past Meena and opening the door to
her apartment.

He enters...


INT. MEENA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

And Freddy finds her apartment completely empty.

The walls are bare. The couch is gone. All that remains are
some boxes in the corner.

Freddy turns to face Meena, still standing in the doorway.

                    MEENA
          I wanted to say something earlier.
          I'm sorry I didn't.

                    FREDDY
          What's going on?

                    MEENA
          When I go to India next week, I'm
          not coming back.

This hits Freddy like a gut punch. He looks for somewhere to
sit, but there's nothing.

Meena takes a step in from the doorway.

                    MEENA
          My visa will expire. So I'm going
          home to help run my dad's company.
          That's what I've been working
          toward. Planning for. And this...
                    (MORE)
                                                             23.

                    MEENA (CONT’D)
               (beat)
          This can't work.

Freddy nods his head.

                    FREDDY
          You're giving up.

                    MEENA
          I'm being realistic.

                    FREDDY
          Real? What we have is real. But for
          the past year you've kept a
          distance. You've never gone all in!
          Cause you're absolutely terrified
          of commitment.

Meena moves toward Freddy. Her sadness seeping into anger.

                    MEENA
          I'm only terrified because I'm not
          living in a fantasy. You haven't
          been listening and have no idea how
          scary my situation actually is!

                    FREDDY
          What-- that you'll disappoint your
          parents? That your dad won't let
          you take over the family business?

                    MEENA
          So I'm supposed to give up on my
          dreams?

                    FREDDY
          All I know is that I love you and
          it shouldn't matter the obstacle--

                    MEENA
          They're not obstacles; they're my
          family! And if anyone was an
          obstacle to my plans it was you--

Their argument has brought them face to face.

And their anger quickly retreats back to embarrassment.

                       MEENA
          I'm sorry.
                                                                24.


                    FREDDY
          I'm sorry, too. I know you have
          plans. Amazing plans. I just wanted
          to be a part of them.

Freddy, embarrassed, looks down at the floor.

                     MEENA
                (taking a deep breath)
          Let's be logical. If we stay
          together, my parents will find out.
          Best case scenario, they'll expect
          us to get married. Are we ready for
          that?
                (beat)
          Because if you met my parents, I
          don't know how they'd react. If you
          met my grandparents-- my God, you
          couldn't even speak to them because
          you don't speak Hindi--

                    FREDDY
               (head still down)
          Meena, I...

Meena takes Freddy's head in her hand, forcing him to look at
her and confront the issue before them.

                    MEENA
          I know you think it should be easy.
          But even you have to admit that
          this is too hard.

Freddy shuts his eyes, hoping this moment can just end.

She's heartbroken. His world is destroyed.

Meena takes Freddy's hands in hers. She searches for the
words so Freddy will understand.

So she sings.

She wishes things would change. But they won't. She wants to
be with him. But she doesn't know how. She doesn't want to
hurt like this. But she does.

And she's afraid they'll hurt each other more if they don't
deal with this now.

Therefore, she must stick to her plans. Therefore, she sings:

I Have To Go
                                                                25.


Finally, Freddy looks up. He falls into her arms, and they
hold each other.


INT. MEENA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Alone in her kitchen, Meena continues SINGING.

She watches as Freddy packs boxes in her living room.

Meena starts slowly taking her photos down from her fridge...


EXT. STREETS OF CHICAGO - NIGHT

Walking arm in arm, her SONG continues as Freddy and Meena
take one last final stroll through their city...

And the song fades out...

                                                    CUT TO:


INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

The SOUNDS of gate change announcements, dragged suitcases,
and crying babies. O'Hare International Airport.

This is where they'll say goodbye.

From a distance, we watch as Meena faces Freddy at the
security line.

We cannot hear the words they exchange, but we know it's only
pleasantries hiding tremendous hurt.

They embrace. And then Meena turns to leave, wiping a tear
from her face.

Freddy remains a moment, before turning and leaving alone,
with his head hung low.


INT. AIRPORT - MOVING SIDEWALK PASSAGEWAY - LATER

In an under lit and empty passageway connecting terminals,
Meena stands on a moving walkway. She cries softly, as it
carries her toward her awaiting plane.

She shuts her eyes tight, fighting back tears.

Then, Meena opens her eyes. She turns around. Facing toward
where she came from. Unable to contain the emotions bubbling
up within her...
                                                                26.


She SINGS.

She sings that she must be logical. She has to go.

He should have understood. She has to go.

Meena walks toward us. And against the walkway. Going
nowhere.

She sings about how she'll miss him more than she's ever
missed someone before. And yet, she has to go.

So Meena stops singing. Wipes her face. Turns back around.
And let's the walkway take her to her gate.

Standing still, but every moment getting farther and farther
away from Freddy...

                                                FADE OUT.


INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Home from the airport, Freddy enters his apartment.

He shuffles to the living room, and collapses onto the couch.

Hanging above him, black and white movie posters adorn the
wall. Movies with happier endings than his own experience.

Freddy looks to his side table, stacked high with books and
tapes:

TEACH YOURSELF HINDI


EXT. NAVY PIER - DAY

Back on Navy Pier, Freddy sits alone on a bench.

Behind him, the Grand Ballroom is roped off for construction.


INT. FREDDY'S PARENTS' HOME - DAY

Freddy sits with his mother and father in the living room,
barely able to stay focused.

                       FREDDY'S MOTHER
             We loved her, but she never even
             told her parents about you. How
             serious could she have been?

Freddy, distracted, barely acknowledges her statement.
                                                                27.


                    FREDDY'S FATHER
          You need to be realistic, son. It
          was just too difficult.

Freddy looks up, and nods his head.


EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - DAY

Freddy walks the streets of Chicago, lost in thought--

He looks up: LOGAN THEATER. The site of their first date.

He gazes around Logan Square.

And mixed with the SOUNDS of cars, trains, and crowds...

The SOUND of STRINGS.

Freddy takes a deep breath, and--


EXT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Freddy - wearing a small backpack - bursts out of his
apartment complex and starts strutting down the sidewalk.

The MUSIC builds behind him. And while the busy world around
him may not see or hear it, he SINGS and DANCES with more
life and focus than we've ever seen.

He sings that he can't give up so easily. Nothing - nothing!
- beats a grand gesture. So...

I Have To Go!


EXT. 'L' TRAIN - DAY

On the train platform, as a train blows past, he hops up on a
bench and belts out that he knows it's not over till the
credits. And he can have his happy ending!

He has to go!


INT. AIRPORT - DAY

Finally, in the airport, Freddy spins up to the counter and--

                    FREDDY
          One ticket to India.

He's beaming.
                                                                28.


The TICKET AGENT: not so much.

                    TICKET AGENT
          Do you have a ticket?

                    FREDDY
          No. I, uh, need one. I guess.

                    TICKET AGENT
          And you want to buy it here? At the
          counter? And not, like, online?
               (beat)
          I mean you can technically do it.
          But it'll cost a lot. Like a ton.
               (beat)
          Why do you need a ticket so bad?

                    FREDDY
               (with a shrug)
          I... I have to go.

And the MUSIC swells as--

                    TICKET AGENT
          This gonna be cash or credit?

Freddy pauses before opening his mouth to respond and...


INT. AIRPORT - MOVING SIDEWALK PASSAGEWAY - DAY

OK, so now the MUSIC swells!

Freddy marches down the same depressing moving sidewalk that
took Meena away from him. Only this time, lights of every
color illuminate the passageway.

Freddy sings: he can't not be with her. It's that simple.

He'll do anything - anything! - to be by her side.

So... he has to go!

He dances, spinning around and jumping back and forth on the
moving sidewalk. The MUSIC builds and builds, as the colors
grow brighter and brighter...


INT. AIRPORT - GATE - DAY

Finally, he reaches his gate.

His foot nervously taps. He takes a deep breath. And he sings
below his breath that he has to go.
                                                               29.


And he does - stepping beyond the doors of the gate and
jogging down the walkway toward his plane.


EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

And as the orchestra plays, hitting its crescendo...

Freddy takes off into the air...

                                               FADE OUT:

OVER BLACK... Drums... A steady beat...

                                            SMASH CUT TO:


EXT. MARKET - DAY

Freddy - wearing his backpack and looking the part of the
American tourist - smiles.

He looks left, and takes a step forward into a street--

WHISH!

A car ZIPS by Freddy, nearly running him over. He hops
backward onto the sidewalk.

Rattled, Freddy's eyes dart around - perhaps now only fully
taking in his surrounding.

MARKET VENDORS display their saris. Cows absentmindedly
wander through the streets. A MAN sells pani puri to hungry
customers from his cart.

Taxis and auto-ricksaws fill Freddy's view, and their non-
stop car-horns fill his ears.

We PULL OUT and reveal a packed city street in the heart of
New Delhi. THOUSANDS fill the marekt, and Freddy is only a
very, very small part of what is happening around him.

And as the DRUMS continue to build...

MUSIC EXPLODES - backed by a full orchestra - and the entire
crowd bursts into song!

Freddy has landed in a Bollywood musical!

[NOTE: The Indian dialogue and lyrics are a natural mix of
Hindi and English - much like you'd actually hear in New
Delhi's Connaught Place or Select City Mall.]
                                                               30.


Seemingly every resident of Delhi starts SINGING. And
DANCING. All while going about their lives. Whether a TAXI
DRIVER or a ROADSIDE BARBER or a group of SCHOOL CHILDREN.

Hundreds of conversations are SUNG as we whip around the
market. The lyrics are a small snippet of life in New Delhi.

"Cut me a deal, that's nearly half a lakh." "I need a salwar
kameez for the Mehndi." "Want some chicken tikka pizza from
Nirula's?" "Virat Kohli's the greatest batsman of all time."

Even with subtitles, Freddy would be completely lost.

And as they hit the chorus, they announce WELCOME TO DELHI!

It's the biggest apple. A city that truly never sleeps.

A magic city and an eternal city.

A city of love. A city of lights. A city of music and car
horns blasting through the night.

Freddy tries his best to sing along - but he's lost, not
knowing the words. And he's out of step with the dance,
discovering that you can't tap dance across a street when
seven lanes of traffic whiz by on a three lane road.

With now hundreds dancing in unison, completely blocking
Freddy out, the ensemble comes together for the big finish.

Welcome to Delhi!

And as quickly as it began--

The song ends.

The ensemble dissipates to go back about their lives.

Freddy stands alone. He looks around, now more confused than
he was before.

A look of horror then creeps across his face.

Patting his back pocket, he discovers: his wallet is gone.

                    FREDDY
          Oh no no no no no.

He looks all around, as CROWDS casually breeze past him in
every direction. He's lost. Confused. And screwed.

                    FREDDY
          What am I doing here?
                                                                31.


EXT. MEENA'S HOUSE - DAY

A gate opens... revealing Meena.

The past few weeks have worn on her. She looks tired. As if
exhausted from weeks of crying.

She takes a deep breath, and allows a smile to fight its way
to the surface.

We follow as Meena enters a driveway, passing by a DRIVER who
is washing the family car.

                      MEENA
          Namaste.

He smiles and puts his hands together in return.

Past him, Meena reaches a small barking Indian Spitz dog,
running around in circles and jumping to catch her attention.

                    MEENA
          Hi Sultan baby!

She pets her dog, and turns toward her home.

It's a large house, surrounded by greenery on all sides. But
just as we get a good look at it, we follow Meena inside...


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

The house is mostly marble, with Indian art on the walls.

Meena heads toward the stairs, but takes an impulsive turn
toward the kitchen...


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

We follow as Meena enters the large kitchen. Off to the side,
a COOK chops onions. He doesn't notice as Meena walks to the
stove.

                      MEENA
          Kaise ho?

She takes a spoon and tries the dish being prepared. From her
face we know it's delicious.

                    COOK
          Not ready. Not ready.
                                                              32.


                    MEENA
          It's so good. Thank you, thank you!

With a smile, she turns and heads out of the kitchen...


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

Back in the entryway, Meena walks up the stairs.

Past a sweeping MAID, with whom she exchanges a smile.

Finally, she arrives upstairs to find her parents...


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

SANDEEP sits at his desk, squinting as he types on his very
small phone screen. While he may wear business suits in
meetings, at home he relaxes in kurta pajamas.

SHREE sits in a chair nearby, playing around on an iPad.
Shree is never not in a traditional salwar kameez or sari.

Neither notices as Meena enters.

                    MEENA
          Papa, did you fire the wedding
          planner?

Sandeep and Shree both look up toward their daughter.

                    SANDEEP
          He was behind schedule.

                    MEENA
          Well, now we're doubly behind
          schedule.
               (to Shree)
          Mummy, tell Papa we need a planner
          for your son's wedding.

Shree has returned her focus completely to her iPad.

                    SHREE
          Whatever your Papa says.

Meena rolls her eyes, turning back to Sandeep.

                    MEENA
          And then, without asking me, you
          hired this Narim Patel fellow?
                                                  33.


                    SANDEEP
          Narim Patel? Yes beta. I did hire
          him. But I may have fired him also.

                    MEENA
          You fired two wedding planners?

                    SANDEEP
          They were overcharging! I can cut
          better deals than both of them.
          These wedding planners are all
          about sending business to their
          friends. This way, I can instead
          send business to my friends.

Shree, not paying attention, lifts up her iPad.

                    SHREE
          Do you like this photo?

Shree reveals a photo of Meena on her iPad.

                    MEENA
          Hideous.
               (to Sandeep)
          Wait. This way? What way?

                    SANDEEP
          We don't need a wedding planner.
          Let's plan your brother's wedding
          together. Just you and I!

                    MEENA
               (to Shree)
          Mummy!

                    SHREE
               (revealing a new photo)
          Do you like this photo?

                    MEENA
          Better. What's the picture for?

                    SHREE
          I'm editing your biodata. Making it
          snazzier.

                    MEENA
          You said you'd stop sending it out.

                    SHREE
          No. I said I'd be less intense. I'm
          very casual. Relaxed. Look how
          relaxed I am.
                                                               34.


Shree stretches out to reveal just how relaxed she is.

                       MEENA
                  (to Sandeep)
          Papa!

Sandeep is now once again fully immersed in his phone.

                    SANDEEP
          Whatever your mummy says.

                    MEENA
               (to Shree)
          I'm not ready to be set up.

                    SHREE
          This is not some old fashioned set
          up, where a stranger takes you back
          to his village. It's very modern.

                       MEENA
          How?

                    SHREE
          We use e-mail. Regardless, kids
          these days get set up by computers
          all the time. Just think of me as
          your personal Tinder.

                       MEENA
          Oh God.

Shree pulls up some new biodatas on her iPad.

                    SHREE
          I've been sent some very
          interesting biodatas. One's an
          engineer. One's a lawyer. One's...
               (beat)
          Oh, nevermind.

                    SANDEEP
          What does he do?

                    SHREE
          He... makes apps.

Sandeep and Shree try to hold it in... but eventually GIGGLE
together at such a silly, unstable job choice.

Meena, trying to restrain her annoyance, turns to leave.
                                                              35.


                    SHREE
          Come on, beta. Is there a reason
          you don't want us sending out your
          biodata? A reason to hold off?

Meena turns, and glances from Shree to Sandeep.

Meena considers. But--

                    MEENA
          It's fine. Send it out.


EXT. TRAIN TERMINAL - DAY

CROWDS OF DOZENS stand in line at the train terminal to
purchase tickets. And by "stand in line", I mean that they
are crowding in and constantly pushing forward.

And at the very front of this massive "line" is Freddy.

Freaked out and totally out of his element, Freddy speaks
with a very uninterested TELLER.

                    FREDDY
          I need to get to a part of town
          called...

Freddy pulls a crumbled up piece of paper from his pocket.

                    FREDDY
          New Friends Colony? Yeah. Would it
          be better to take a train or taxi?

The Teller neither responds nor reacts in any way.

                    FREDDY
          Also, I have no money. My wallet
          was stolen. But I can Paypal you--
               (beat)
          I also have nine American dollars.

The Teller remains stoic and unmoving.

And just as Freddy nearly starts again, he hears:

                    DEV (O.S.)
          I'll be in New Friends Colony by
          tonight.

Freddy's attention darts toward a well dressed young Indian
man walking away from him. This is DEV.
                                                                36.


                     FREDDY
               (to the Teller)
          Excuse me.

Freddy turns and starts sprinting after Dev.

                    DEV
          Yes, I'm getting on now as we
          speak. I promise I'll be there.

Following about ten steps behind Dev, Freddy weaves through
the crowd, bumping into way too many people, and yelling:

                    FREDDY
          Sorry! Namaste! Sorry!

Freddy looking for Dev in the crowd, bumps straight into-- AN
INDIAN ARMY OFFICIAL

                    FREDDY
          Namaste. And thank you for your
          service.

A train whistle BLOWS.

Freddy looks up and spots Dev getting on a train.

He grabs the straps on his backpack and starts running toward
the train.

And as it starts moving...

And he's running beside it...

He jumps on!


INT. TRAIN - DAY

Dev has settled in his seat in the first class cabin.

Freddy, exhausted, collapses into the seat across the aisle
from him.

Freddy looks to Dev with a big smile.

Dev nods back awkwardly, and immediately pulls out his phone.

                    FREDDY
          How long's this train ride?

                     DEV
               (barely looking up)
          Six hours.
                                                               37.


                    FREDDY
          Wow. This is a huge city.

                     DEV
          It is...

                    FREDDY
          I mean, six hours to get to New
          Friends Colony. Didn't realize it
          was that far out.

Dev straightens up, and faces Freddy.

                    DEV
          This train isn't going to New
          Friends Colony.

The smile drops from Freddy's face in horror.

                    FREDDY
          But you said it was!

                    DEV
          We've never spoken before.
               (beat)
          Were you eavesdropping?

                    FREDDY
          Yes. I was totally eavesdropping.
          Why would you have said that?

                    DEV
          I was lying.

                    FREDDY
          ...OK. So then where are we going?

                    DEV
          A city called Jaipur.

Freddy spins and looks out the window as the city passes by.

                     FREDDY
          Oh shit!

Freddy looks around, panicked.

He spots a SECURITY GUARD and quickly jumps to his feet.

Freddy jogs up the aisle to the Security Guard, facing him:

                    FREDDY
          Excuse me, I need to get off.
                                                                38.


                    SECURITY TRAIN
          No stop until Jaipur.

An idea occurs to Freddy:

                    FREDDY
          Wait! But I snuck on the train. I
          don't have a ticket. So you can
          just throw me off.

                    SECURITY TRAIN
          You illegally snuck on the train?

                      FREDDY
                 (proudly)
          Yes!

                    SECURITY TRAIN
          Then you'll be arrested.

                    FREDDY
          Arrested in Delhi?

                    SECURITY TRAIN
          Arrested in Jaipur.

                    FREDDY
          Oh. Well. Goddammit.

Freddy once again finds himself in a awful, shitty situation.

He's then surprised when DEV slaps his hand on Freddy's
shoulder. Dev smiles to the Security Guard.

                    DEV
          I'm sorry. He's confused. I needed
          to buy his ticket.

Dev pulls out a wad of rupees, handing it to the Guard.

                    DEV
          Is this alright?

The Guard nods, turns, and leaves.

Before he can even react, Freddy's eyes look out the window
as the city of New Delhi passes him by.


INT. RESTAURANT - DUSK

Bowls are served with steaming spinach subzee and daal.

Plates are served with crisp dosai and fresh roti.
                                                             39.


If your mouth isn't watering, you must not understand what
you're missing.

At a high-class, modern Indian restaurant, Meena sits at a
table near a window overlooking a vast green lawn.

Across from her sits Priya and her husband, BASU.

Meena and Priya dig in to the feast before them. Basu,
meanwhile, seems far more interested in his phone.

                    PRIYA
          So after this, let's head over to
          Abinav's for drinks and to see the
          whole high school gang.

                    MEENA
          I'm good. I'll just go home.

Priya puts down her roti.

                    PRIYA
          No. No more of your moping around.

                    MEENA
          I'm not moping around.

                    PRIYA
          Let's go to Dubai this weekend!
          Basu's chacha owns Masala Air and
          he can get us unlimited miles.

Upon hearing his name, Basu looks up from his phone.

                     BASU
          Babe, it's not unlimited. I get an
          allowance.

                    PRIYA
               (ignoring him)
          Come on, Meena. Dubai!

Basu shrugs and turns back to his phone.

                    MEENA
          Seriously, I'm fine. But I--

Meena thinks for a moment...

                    MEENA
          I just left Chicago. I don't need
          to run away anywhere else.
                                                            40.


                    PRIYA
          Do you think you ran away... here?

                    MEENA
          No-- I mean, I would have stayed in
          the states with him if I could
          have. Honestly, I just wanted to be
          wherever he was--
               (beat)
          But I'm here. Work with my father's
          been great. And honestly I missed
          Delhi. And I missed the food.

She uses her roti to scoop up a generous portion of aloo.

                    PRIYA
          And you missed me?

                    MEENA
               (smirking)
          Not particularly.

                    PRIYA
          Oh go to hell.

Meena smiles. But as she gets lost in thought...

                    MEENA
          It's just-- Chicago felt like home.
               (beat)
          But this is home.

Meena nods and they return back to their incredible meal.


INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

Freddy, his head resting against the train window, slowly
opens his eyes.

The first thing he notices is that the train has stopped.

The second is that the train car is now empty.

An extremely jet-lagged Freddy BOLTS UP, looking out the
window at the Jaipur train station.

And he once again spots Dev quickly walking away.

                     FREDDY
          Hey!...
               (no idea what his name is)
          My friend!
                                                           41.


EXT. JAIPUR TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

Dev walks through the train station, when Freddy appears
beside him once again.

An over-eager Freddy extends his hand.

                    FREDDY
          Thank you! I'm Freddy by the way.

                    DEV
               (shaking his hand)
          I'm Dev. And it's no problem. It
          was actually kind of amusing.

Freddy and Dev arrive near the ticket counter.

Dev points up to a TRAIN SCHEDULE.

                    DEV
          Well, you should probably catch the
          next train back to Delhi...
               (reading)
          Tomorrow morning.

Another gut punch for Freddy. He's nearly immune now.

                    DEV
          You don't have a place to stay or
          any money, do you?

Freddy shakes his head.

                    DEV
          Let's get you a ticket.
               (beat)
          And a drink.


INT. BAR - NIGHT

Two glasses are filled with Johnny Walker Black Label.

Turned away from Dev, Freddy stares at his phone.

MEENA

Freddy's finger hovers over the call button.

                    FREDDY
          Ah, screw it.
                                                              42.


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

With the TV on, Sandeep is fast asleep in a recliner.

Sitting on a nearby couch next to Shree, Meena picks up her
BUZZING phone.

"FREDDY"

Meena turns away from her mother, answering softly:

                     MEENA
           Hello?


INT. BAR - NIGHT

Freddy hears her voice, and instantly lights up.

                     FREDDY
           Meena. Meena!
                (beat)
           Meena?

He looks at his phone, as its battery dies in front of him.

                     FREDDY
           No no no. Don't die. Don't die!


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Meena looks at her phone before putting it back to her ear.

                     MEENA
           Hello? Hello?

Confused. Sad. Slightly worried. She puts her phone away.

                     SHREE (O.S.)
           Who was that?

                     MEENA
           Oh... no one.

And at that moment, ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS.

But it's not in her head. Meena looks up to the TV screen.

A scene from the film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.

A woman stands in a field of yellow flowers. She looks to a
man standing in the field, facing away from her. He turns,
and their eyes meet. She runs to him and they embrace.
                                                                43.


Meena relaxes on the couch next to Shree, putting her head on
her mother's shoulder.

Shree looks down at Meena with a smile.


INT. BAR - NIGHT

Freddy, totally deflated, sits down at a table.

Across from him, Dev hands him a glass of whiskey.

                    DEV
          Well, cheers!

Freddy nods and the two men drink.

                    DEV
          So, this girl. She's Indian?

                    FREDDY
          Yeah. And I guess her family...
          hates white people?

                    DEV
          Impossible. All Indians love white
          people. It's Stockholm Syndrome
          from the British era. Seriously,
          people are gonna love you here.

                    FREDDY
          Really?

Freddy glances over at a nearby WAITER, who gives him a super
friendly thumbs up.

                    FREDDY
          So her family will accept me?

                    DEV
          Oh. Almost definitely not. When it
          comes to marriage, Indians can get
          very traditional. Take my parents.
          They kept pushing and pushing for
          me to get engaged.

                    FREDDY
          So what did you do?

                    DEV
          I got engaged. Yeah, my parents
          found a sweet girl. From a family
          of orthodontists. And they want me
          to be an orthodontist.
                    (MORE)
                                                              44.

                    DEV (CONT’D)
               (beat)
          Please never bring up
          orthodontistry around me.

Dev trails off, motioning to the Waiter for more whiskey.

                    DEV
          But I was in love with someone
          else. Someone my parents wouldn't
          accept. And I nearly threw it all
          away to be with them. But I didn't.

                    FREDDY
          Sometimes it's just too hard.
               (looking around)
          Sometimes it hurts too much.

Dev looks his sad new friend up and down.

                     DEV
          Take it from me, a man who's
          literally running away from his
          problems back home. It hurts much
          more to be without the person you
          love.
                (beat)
          Tell me. How do you feel when
          you're with her?

                    FREDDY
          I feel like... I feel like the kind
          of guy who can hop on a plane and
          fly across the world in the name of
          love. Like some kind of... of...

                    DEV
          Hero.

                    FREDDY
          But maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm just a
          guy who's lost.

                    DEV
          You're never truly lost if you know
          where you're going.

Dev and Freddy pick up their new shots of whiskey as...

The MUSIC pumps in. Gone are the traditional Indian drums -
replaced by electronic beats.

Freddy smiles, drawn into Dev's world...

And Dev starts SINGING.
                                                                45.


In the form of a toast, he SINGS to Freddy about love, and
why it's worth fighting for. No matter what happens, you have
to take a shot.

Then, on cue, the two men take a shot.

Dev sings about how no obstacle, big or small, can stand in
his way. He needs to take a shot.

And so, they take another shot.

Almost instantly drunker than a moment ago, Dev stands and
grabs Freddy's shirt, pulling him up off his chair. He SINGS
that Freddy knows what he must do. He knows what he must be.


EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

Dev and Freddy burst out of a stairwell and onto a rooftop in
the heart of Jaipur.

With some killer dance moves, Dev spins around. He points to
Freddy, and SINGS:

Be A Hero!

Dev continues to dance around, and up to, every edge of the
rooftop.

Freddy joins in - or at least attempts to. Dancing side by
side, Dev gives Freddy quick pointers on this very different
dancing style. Quick kicks. And a lot more hands.


EXT. JAIPUR STREETS - INTERCUT

As the song continues, Dev and Freddy dance through the
streets of Jaipur.

IN ONE MOMENT, Freddy follows Dev who dances into one side of
a taxi ricksaw, and then they both dance out the other side -
eventually making their way across the street.

IN ANOTHER MOMENT, the two fast friends have found their way
onto a motorcycle. Dev drives the motorcycle, and Freddy sits
in the sidecar.

AND IN YET ANOTHER MOMENT, Dev and Freddy pass a bottle of
whiskey back and forth. And soon their perfect dance steps
have transformed into a more artful stumble.

But Dev has continued SINGING. And one final time, he
implores his new friend: Be A Hero!
                                                               46.


They cheers. Dev takes a final swig, finishing the bottle.


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Meena, holding a plastic binder, enters the living room.
Looking up from her binder, she finds Shree reading a book.

                    MEENA
          Mummy, I have a quick question--

                    SHREE
          You made a binder?

                    MEENA
          This is the first of many binders.
          I'm throwing myself into this
          completely. Not thinking about...
          anything else because-- we have 11
          days to plan nearly the entirety of
          your son's wedding!
               (beat)
          So, why aren't you more stressed?

                    SHREE
          Because I knew you'd make a binder.
          And I know your father.

                    MEENA
          Why? What is Papa up to?

At that moment, Sandeep storms into living room - wearing a
headset and speaking very LOUDLY on the phone.

                    SANDEEP
          Listen you fool! If you want to
          remain our caterer, I'll need more
          alcohol. I want to brag to my
          friends not about how many bottles
          we drank, but how many cases of
          bottles we drank. Understood? OK!

Sandeep hangs up, and turns to Meena.

                    SANDEEP
          We're going to need more alcohol.
          Call the guests from America. Tell
          them to pick up two bottles of
          Black Label each at duty free on
          their way in.

Sandeep turns and heads right back out the door and into the
hallway. Meena starts following him when--
                                                                47.


                    MEENA
          Papa!

She nearly bumps into a man standing in the hallway. He's
tall and very, very handsome. This is KABIR.

Meena is caught off guard, unsure who this stranger is.

                    MEENA
          Hello?

                    KABIR
          Hello.

                    SANDEEP (O.S.)
          We have one week!

Meena and Kabir turn to Sandeep yelling from the other room,
before an uncomfortable Kabir smiles and turns back to Meena.

                    KABIR
          I'm sorry. Your driver let me in.
          My name's--

                    SANDEEP (O.S.)
          Wait! Wait!

Sandeep runs back into the hallway, skidding in between Meena
and Kabir.

Out of breath, he shakes Kabir's hand.

                     SANDEEP
          Kabir, my boy! Do you have the
          paperwork?

Kabir hands over a small envelope, which Sandeep barely
acknowledges before turning to Meena.

Feigning surprise at her presense, he turns back to Kabir.

                    SANDEEP
          Oh, I forgot to introduce you. This
          is my daughter Meena. She recently
          got her MBA. In America!
               (to Meena)
          And this is Kabir.

Meena blankly looks at her father, before throwing on a fake
smile and giving a nod.

                    SANDEEP
          His father owns the largest plastic
          bottling plant in India.
                    (MORE)
                                                                48.

                    SANDEEP (CONT’D)
          We're closing some deals, so I
          wanted Kabir to come over and
          officially introduce himself to me.
          And us.

Sandeep's enthusiasm for this introduction is far beyond both
Meena, who stares straight at her father, and Kabir, who
mostly looks down at his feet.

                    SANDEEP
          I know there could be some
          potential, uh, arrangements. Not
          arrangements, but we want to set
          up-- I mean, we're setting up, or
          rather putting together a potential
          partnership. Yes! Partnership.

Sandeep beams proudly.

Meena is mortified.

Shree laughs to herself from her seat in the living room.

                    KABIR
          ... Yes sir. Thank you for having
          me, sir.

                     SANDEEP
          Join us for lunch sometime. We'll
          be around.
               (to Meena)
          Meena, will you be around?

                      MEENA
          For what?

                      SANDEEP
          Lunch?

                      MEENA
          When?

                      SANDEEP
          Anytime.

                    MEENA
          Are you asking if I'll be around
          anytime for lunch at my own house?
               (beat)
          Presumably.

                    SANDEEP
          Great! Well now that we've--
                                                             49.


                    MEENA
          I have to make some calls.
               (to Kabir)
          It was nice to meet you.

Meena turns to leave, shaking her head on her way down the
stairs.


INT. JAIPUR TRAIN STATION - DAY

An exhausted Dev, ticket in hand, walks up to an extremely
energetic Freddy.

                    DEV
          Are you ready?

                    FREDDY
          You kidding? Yeah! Even though we
          were up all night, I am pumped!
               (beat)
          Do you think I'm jet-lagged?

Dev hands over the ticket, and a stack of rupees.

                    DEV
          Here's your ticket. And when you
          arrive, this should cover the cost
          of your taxi. Unless...
               (beat)
          Unless you're American. So...
               (hands him more cash)
          Just give him all of this.

                    FREDDY
          Thanks.

                    DEV
          So what are you going to do?

                    FREDDY
          Be a hero! Win her back! And let
          nothing stop me!
               (beat)
          And what are you gonna do?

                    DEV
          Hang out with my friends in Jaipur
          and continue avoiding my problems!

                    FREDDY
          Come on, Dev. We just did a whole--
               (imitating their dance)
                    (MORE)
                                                           50.

                    FREDDY (CONT’D)
          -- thing about this. You need to be
          with her.

                    DEV
          It's not that simple. Because...
          they won't let me be with... him.

The final word hangs in the air.

                    DEV
          They won't let me be with Raj.

Freddy pauses, finally understanding Dev's situation.

                    FREDDY
          Oh. Raj. Right.
               (beat)
          Then I need to change my advice.

                       DEV
          I figured.

                    FREDDY
          You don't need to be with her. You
          need to be with him. The rest of
          the advice is exactly the same.

The train horn BLOWS.

Dev nods, and extends his hand to bid Freddy farewell.

Freddy instead pulls him in for a hug.


EXT. MEENA'S HOUSE - DAY

Meena sits on a small bench in her front lawn.

Her dog Sultan silently sits beside her as she pets him.

Behind her, Kabir exits the house.

                    KABIR
          Correct me if I'm wrong, but I
          think your father may have called
          me over for more than business.

Meena turns around and looks at Kabir curiously.

Kabir walks up and stands near her.

                    KABIR
          I had no idea. You must believe me.
                                                               51.


She nods, giving a slight laugh at how silly it all is.

                    KABIR
          All the same, it was nice to meet
          you. So, if I'm tricked into seeing
          you a second time, that would be
          fine with me.

Kabir smiles at his own (objectively) great line.

He then leans down to pet Sultan, who--

GROWLS and BARKS at Kabir, shooting him backwards.

Kabir awkwardly LAUGHS, nods to Meena, and stumbles away.

She watches him go, hiding her own laughter while petting a
now extremely calm Sultan.

Meena looks up as Shree sits down next to her.

Mother and daughter watch as Kabir exits out the front gate.

                    MEENA
          Were you in on this?

                    SHREE
          This was all Papa. Besides, if I'd
          have been in on it, it'd have been
          so subtle, you'd never have known.

                    MEENA
          I give Papa permission to set me
          up, and he waits 20 hours. And then
          uses it as an opportunity to seal
          some big business deal!

                    SHREE
          That's not why he did it.
               (beat)
          That's not the only reason why he
          did it.

                    MEENA
          I'm just not ready.

                    SHREE
          You'll never be ready.

Meena shakes her head.
                                                                52.


                    SHREE
          So, what did you think of him? Nice
          boy. Family oriented. What's wrong
          with him?

Meena searches for the words.

                    MEENA
          He's not... special.

Shree puts her arm around Meena. They look off, leaving the
conversation for now.


INT. GARDEN - DAY

Later, Meena wanders through her parent's garden - alone.

Out of sight of anyone else, she pulls out her phone from her
pocket. With a few clicks:

A PICTURE OF FREDDY AND MEENA

She stares at it. Smiling. And then--

Like being hit by a flood of emotions, Meena breaks down.

The phone drops to the ground, and her hands cover her face,
as she bursts into tears.

She slowly lowers herself to the ground, perhaps finally
allowing herself to feel the pain of being without him.

She wipes the tears from her face. Catches her breath.

Meena looks directly into the camera.

And with a soft, sweet voice - she SINGS.

The song is sung in Hindi - the subtitles revealing poetic
language as if from another time.

She sings about the deep pain in her heart. An incompleteness
to her every moment, and a fear that this missing piece will
haunt her for a lifetime.

She feels torn - as if her heart lives in two separate lands.

She never thought she could feel the emotions she is feeling.
She never thought she would sing the words she is singing.

And yet there's no one to speak to about this pain. No one
will understand. So she sings for herself. She sings for him.
                                                                53.


INT. CAR - DAY

Meena sits in the backseat of her car, driven through the
city of New Delhi. Reflections of life hit the window, but
Meena's still lost deep in thought.


EXT. STREET - DAY

The SONG continues over images of Meena sleepwalking her way
through the day.

Meena walks alone, past STALLS and MARKETS. She makes eye
contact with no one. She pays no attention to anyone or
anything.


EXT. GARDEN - DAY

Returning to the garden, she paces back and forth.

Finally, Meena reaches down and picks up her phone.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

Meena and Sandeep, dressed in business attire, both shake the
hand of a BUSINESSMAN - as they finish a meeting together.

As he turns to leave, Sandeep looks toward Meena proudly.

Meena forces a smile.


EXT. GARDEN - DUSK

Day has turned to night.

Meena sits on a bench in the garden.

She types on her phone.

We only catch glimpses: FREDDY... MISS YOU... LOVE YOU...

Meena turns one final time toward us.

She SINGS: This pain I feel. I've created for myself. I could
end it at any moment. But I made my decision. To prevent the
pain for others.

She ASKS: Am I wrong? Why does this feel so wrong? Why does
this hurt so bad?

And with that, her finger touches the delete button.
                                                               54.


And her message to Freddy is GONE.

                    MEENA
               (to herself, softly)
          Freddy...


INT. TAXI - NIGHT

Freddy JOLTS awake.

Wiping the drool from his mouth, he notices he's in the back
of a taxi.

The TAXI DRIVER faces him.

Freddy looks out the window, momentarily panicking.

                    FREDDY
          We're in New Delhi, right?

                      TAXI DRIVER
                 (confused)
          Yes.

                    FREDDY
          Oh thank God!

Relaxing, he looks back out the window at Meena's home.


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Meena paces inside her home, going over some documents from
one of her many binders.

She hears a NOISE from outside.

Meena turns, looking out a window. The Guard has opened the
gate. A man is entering.

That man is FREDDY.

Shock. Excitement. Giddiness.


EXT. MEENA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Freddy, still in a daze, looks around as he walks up the
driveway.

His eyes turn toward the open front door. He spots MEENA.

She slowly walks toward him.
                                                               55.


Soon, she can't control herself, and starts to jog.

And when they meet, they pause. Three feet apart. A smile on
each of their faces.

                       FREDDY
          Meena. I--

                    SANDEEP (O.S.)
          Meena! Who is it?

Freddy and Meena turn to find Sandeep standing on his porch.

                    MEENA
               (softly)
          Freddy...

Meena's smile has disappeared. Reality has set in.

Sandeep, with Sultan right on his heels, walks up to Freddy.

Sultan instantly begins sniffing and licking at Freddy.

                    SANDEEP
          Fantastic guard dog.
               (to Freddy)
          So, who are you?

                    MEENA
          Papa. This is my friend Freddy.

                    SANDEEP
               (to Freddy)
          Ah. And how do you know each other?

                    MEENA
          From... school! He's a schoolmate.

Freddy shoots Meena a puzzled glance.

                    SANDEEP
          I see. And, Freddy, what were you
          studying?

                    FREDDY
          Well, sir, I actually make--

                     MEENA
          Buildings!
               (nervously)
          He's a building... engineer. He was
          studying... building engineering.

Freddy, extremely confused, looks to Meena.
                                                                56.


She shrugs and mouths back "I don't know..."

                    SANDEEP
          An engineer. Very impressive.

                    MEENA
          Like I said, Freddy's a friend. And
          he's passing through India. On
          vacation. I guess.

                    FREDDY
          Yeah. I actually wanted to--

                    SANDEEP
          Of course! The answer is of course
          you can stay here with us!

                    MEENA
          Papa, we don't have to--

                    SANDEEP
          Nonsense! He must stay. I insist!

Meena (speechless and terrified) looks to Freddy.

Freddy (speechless and... excited) looks back to Meena.


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

The middle of the night. The house is quiet.

A bedroom door opens. Freddy eagerly pops his head out.

The opposite door opens. Meena stands in the doorway.

                    FREDDY
          Hi.

Meena puts her hands on her hips in disbelief.

                    MEENA
          Hi? Hi?! What are you doing here?!

Meena catches herself raising her voice, and in a panic she
ducks back into her bedroom.

A freaked out Freddy soon follows suit, closing his door.

Down the hallway, a door OPENS and Sandeep pops his head out.
Groggy and half-asleep, he looks around before closing his
door again.

The hallway is empty and quiet, until...
                                                                57.


Meena's door opens. As does Freddy's.

She shakes her head, and can't help but smile. He continues
speaking in half-whispers.

                    FREDDY
          I missed you.

                    MEENA
          I missed you too. So much... But
          when the hell did you get to Delhi?

                    FREDDY
          Well, I just came in on a train
          from Jaipur. It's a long story.

                    MEENA
          Jaipur? Were you OK? Were you lost?
          Oh God - did you drink any
          unfiltered water?

                    FREDDY
          Don't worry. I only drank alcohol.

                    MEENA
          And then you came here. To my home.
          And met my father--

                    FREDDY
          Who thinks I'm just a schoolmate.
          Also, if you were gonna make up an
          impressive job, couldn't I just be
          an architect. The hell's a building
          engineer?

                    MEENA
          You put me on the spot. I panicked!

Both Meena and Freddy realize that he was too loud, and
instinctively step back into their rooms, closing their doors
simultaneously.

Down the hallway, Sandeep's door opens once again.

He rubs his eyes, looks around, and then pops back in.

Freddy's door then opens. As does Meena's.

                    FREDDY
          I'm here to win you back. So
          tomorrow, let's tell the truth. And
          be together. And then you can show
          me around Delhi.
                    (MORE)
                                                                58.

                    FREDDY (CONT’D)
          Maybe we can see India Gate. I know
          it's tourist-y, but I should see it
          while I'm here.

                    MEENA
          Freddy. We discussed this. I'm
          terrified of how my parents would
          react. So, if we told them, we'd
          have to be 100% sure about each
          other. And right now, we're not
          even dating.

Freddy's enthusiasm deflates as she speaks.

                    MEENA
          Our situation hasn't changed. My
          plans haven't changed. All you've
          done is complicate things for me.
               (beat)
          Good night.

Before Freddy can respond, Meena closes the door to her room.

Alone in the hallway, Freddy slowly disappears behind his own
closing door.

And once again, the hallway is empty and quiet.

Freddy re-opens his door, waiting for Meena to do the same.

She does not.

However, down the hallway, Sandeep's door OPENS.

They make eye contact.

                    SANDEEP
          Jetlag?

                    FREDDY
          ... Definitely. Good night.

And with that, Freddy closes his bedroom door for the night.


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - MORNING

Meena and Freddy, standing a non-suspicious distance apart,
walk down the stairs together.

                    MEENA
          Please don't say anything at lunch.
                                                                59.


                    FREDDY
          What would I bring up?

As they reach the bottom of the stairs, Shree exits the
dining room and heads toward them.

                    MEENA
               (to Freddy)
          Oh nothing, buddy!

Meena punches Freddy on the arm as casually as she can.

Shree, confused, smiles and heads past them up the stairs.

                       FREDDY
          That hurt.

                    MEENA
          I'm not kidding around Freddy.

                    FREDDY
          Neither am I. I think I'm bruised.

                    MEENA
          You can't act romantic. At all.

Meena heads into the dining room.

Freddy, following behind her:

                    FREDDY
          Oh yeah. Cause I was gonna make a
          move on you over lunch with your
          parents. Who do you think I am?

And as Freddy and Meena disappear into the dining room:

The front door swings open and Kabir enters. Kabir is trailed
by Sandeep's driver, holding the door open for him.

                    KABIR
          Sandeep Uncle?

Sandeep eagerly sprints down the stairs toward Kabir.

                    KABIR
          I have more paperwork, sir.

                    SANDEEP
          Of course! Of course!

                    KABIR
          You know, next time I could just
          have the driver bring it.
                                                                60.


                    SANDEEP
          Nonsense! You can never trust a
          driver--
               (spotting his own driver)
          Except mine who I trust with my
          life. Please, come in. We're having
          lunch.

                       KABIR
          Oh OK.

                    SANDEEP
          Meena has a buddy in from America.

                       KABIR
          A buddy?


INT. MEENA'S HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY

Meena stares straight ahead, as Freddy and Kabir - sitting on
either side of her - look each other over.

                       KABIR
          Hey buddy.

                    FREDDY
          Hey... buddy.

                    SANDEEP
          This is Kabir. His father runs
          India's largest bottling plant.

                    FREDDY
          Wow. Handsome and rich.
               (to Kabir)
          And single?

                       KABIR
          Yes.

                     FREDDY
               (fuck)
          Of course.

                    MEENA
          So Freddy has to leave after lunch.

                       SANDEEP
          Nonsense!

                    MEENA
          Not everything is nonsense! It's
          not nonsense if he has other plans.
                                                                61.


                    FREDDY
          Oh, I have no other plans.

                    SANDEEP
          Then it's settled. You'll spend the
          day with us. And then be our guest
          for the big party I'm throwing to
          welcome my son back to Delhi.

                    FREDDY
          Sounds great!

Freddy smiles at Sandeep, and then turns to Meena, who shoots
him a glance that immediately wipes the grin off his face.

                    KABIR
          Sandeep uncle. You know we started
          construction on our new factory--

                    SANDEEP
          Ah, you should discuss this with
          Freddy. He's a building engineer.

The table turns to look at Freddy - who is mid-bite.

                    FREDDY
          Yes. I became one very recently.

                    SHREE
          Well done, Freddy. Congratulations.

                    MEENA
               (deadpan)
          Yes, congratulations.

                       FREDDY
          Thank you.

                    KABIR
          Then Freddy you'll love this. So
          we're building our factory, and
          there was an old temple or some
          ridiculous thing next door. And we
          were given two options. Either
          build around it. Or spend years in
          court fighting to demolish it.

                    FREDDY
          What did you do?

                    KABIR
          Option three. We tore it down
          without asking permission and paid
          the fine.
                                                                62.


Freddy nods, biting his tongue.

Meena turns to Kabir.

                    MEENA
          Surely there was a solution to both
          maintain the temple and--

                    KABIR
               (condescendingly)
          It was all very complicated.
               (to Freddy)
          And anyway, success is in always
          looking to the future. Not being
          stuck in the past.

Freddy takes a deep breath, gathers his thoughts, and:

                    FREDDY
          With all due respect, you're wrong.
          The future's good and all, but you
          can't destroy the past. How can we
          know where we're going if we don't
          understand where we came from?

And with that, Freddy takes a bite from a parantha.

A smile ever-so-briefly flashes across Meena's face.

And at the head of the table, Sandeep leans in. Quite
impressed by Meena's "buddy".


EXT. CHANDNI CHOWK MARKET - DAY

Rows and rows of thin alleyways, packed with VENDORS selling
clothes, knick-knacks, and food, as well as THOUSANDS of men,
women, and children pushing through to look at the individual
stalls.

This isn't where the tourists go. This is Chandni Chowk.


EXT. CHANDNI CHOWK MARKET - JEWELRY STALL - DAY

Meena and Shree browse a collection of bangles.

Meena, distracted, turns back down the alley to see Sandeep,
Kabir, and Freddy walking together. She looks worried.

                    MEENA
          What's he doing here again?
                                                                63.


                    SHREE
          Your father wanted to talk
          business.

                    MEENA
          Not Kabir. He's-- oh God! No,
          Freddy. He should be on his way.
          Not stuck talking with Papa about
          God knows what!


EXT. CHANDNI CHOWK MARKET - SOUVENIR STALL - DAY

Down the alley, near a stall selling every cheesy Indian
souvenir imaginable, Freddy nods along as Sandeep continues a
very long and passionate monologue.

                    SANDEEP
          You see, India - and this is a
          proven fact! - had the greatest
          culture in the world. Before the
          British destroyed it.

Freddy keeps nodding along, getting just a bit nervous.

                    SANDEEP
          They took advantage of our Indian
          hospitality. And they lied! Then
          they destroyed our culture. Took
          what was most precious to us.

Sandeep, caught up in the emotions of his speech, takes a
step a bit too close to Freddy.

                    SANDEEP
          For this deception, we should have
          fought these Westerners. We should
          have killed them!

Freddy keeps nodding, trying not to shit his pants.


EXT. CHANDNI CHOWK MARKET - JEWELRY STALL - DAY

Meena tries on bangles, while Shree eyes her.

                    SHREE
          It's funny you brought up Kabir--

                    MEENA
          I didn't. You did.
                                                        64.


                    SHREE
          I'm kidding. But he is nice.
               (beat)
          And cute.
               (beat)
          And a little bit of a kiss-ass.

Meena pauses, before picking up more bangles.

                    SHREE
          You're like your brother. He was so
          against being set up. And look now.
          He'll have such a nice future with
          Anamika. And he's so very happy. He
          told me so himself.

                    MEENA
          He said that?

                    SHREE
          Yes. But I'm just glad this is
          something we can discuss. Because I
          know you better than anyone. So I
          know I'll find you someone special.

Meena nods.


EXT. CHANDNI CHOWK MARKET - SOUVENIR STALL - DAY

Alone, Freddy looks over the souvenirs.

Kabir walks up and browses next to him. Keeping cool.

                    KABIR
          So, what are you doing in India?

                    FREDDY
          I wanted to see the sights. Taj
          Mahal. India Gate.

                    KABIR
          Meena?

Freddy stops, and turns toward Kabir.

Each man trying to read the other.

                    FREDDY
          It was so random running into her--

                    KABIR
          At her house.
                                                                65.


                       FREDDY
          ... Right.

Kabir sizes Freddy up, taking a sip from his water bottle.

Kabir looks down at the bottle, and then offers it to Freddy.

                       KABIR
          Water?

                    FREDDY
          Is it filtered?

                       KABIR
          ... Sure.

Freddy looks from Kabir... to the bottle... and back to
Kabir.

                       FREDDY
          Excuse me.

Freddy darts off.


EXT. CHANDNI CHOWK MARKET - CLOTHING STALL - DAY

Meena shops alone, looking through a pile of plastic wrapped
knock-offs of American clothing brands.

                       MEENA
          How much?

                       CLOTHING VENDOR
          50 rupees.

Meena nods, and puts the shirt aside.

Freddy slides up, and turns to Meena.

                    FREDDY
          I don't like this Kabir guy.

Meena tries her best to keep shopping and ignore him
completely.

                    MEENA
          You're not allowed to get jealous.
          We're not together.

                    FREDDY
          He tried to poison me!
                                                                66.


                       MEENA
          With what?

                       FREDDY
          Water.

Meena looks at Freddy, rolls her eyes, and returns to her
shopping.

Freddy spots the shirt Meena was considering. He picks it up.

                       FREDDY
          How much?

The CLOTHING VENDOR takes a long look at Freddy.

                    CLOTHING VENDOR
          For you... 500 rupees.

                    FREDDY
               (to Meena)
          What a deal!

Meena takes a deep breath before picking up a new item and
showing it to the vendor.

                    MEENA
          And how much is this?

                       CLOTHING VENDOR
          100.
               (beat)
          I mean 700. It's 700 rupees ma'am.

Meena, pissed, throws the item back on the pile and steps in
close to speak with Freddy in hushed tones.

                    MEENA
          Please go away. I don't want to
          talk. And you're going to cost me a
          small fortune.

Meena storms off, leaving Freddy alone with the smiling
clothing vendor.


INT. MEENA'S HOME - ENTRYWAY - DAY

Back from the market, Sandeep and Shree rush ahead into the
house.

Freddy and Meena, bags in each hand, hold back to speak in
private.
                                                             67.


                      MEENA
            Hey, my brother just got to town.
            So please remember: do not mention
            anything. About you or us or
            Chicago or love or anything.

Meena walks on.

Freddy follows behind her.

                      FREDDY
            Why would any of that come up?


INT. MEENA'S HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY

As Freddy enters, he sees Sandeep greeting his son.

Sandeep notices Freddy:

                      SANDEEP
            Ah, Freddy. You must meet my son.

A young man turns around.

It's DEV.

Dev - completely freaked out - freezes before yelling out:

                      DEV
            We've never met!

                      FREDDY
            I know. Exactly. We've never met.

Both men - equally shocked - stare each other down.

Sandeep, in the middle, is confused. But goes with it.

                      SANDEEP
            So I'll introduce you. This is Dev.
            He got back just in time for his
            big party. And Freddy: you should
            come and meet his fiance.

Freddy nods, trying to act cool.

He looks at Dev, incredulously.

                      FREDDY
            His... fiance.
                                                                68.


EXT. EVENT CENTER - DAY

Brightly covered canopies dot the perimeter of a truly lavish
outdoor party.

WAITERS walk around with trays, serving samosas and other
appetizers to GUESTS, each wearing a more elaborate and
colorful traditional Indian outfit than the last.

And in the midst of the party we find ANAMIKA - Dev's fiance.

She's sitting alone in an elaborate sari, shyly smiling as
guests pass.

Anamika'S MOTHER and Sandeep speak behind her.

                    SANDEEP
          We’re so lucky to have Anamika join
          our family. A girl with such strong
          values. And an orthodontist!

                    ANAMIKA'S MOTHER
          And if Dev ever wants to give up
          this whole writing thing and go to
          dental school, he can always join
          our practice.

Anamika looks up and waves:

ACROSS THE PARTY: Dev stands with Freddy - who is wearing a
shirt and tie and is the only person in Western clothes.

Dev waves back to Anamika before turning back to Freddy.

                    FREDDY
               (half-whispering)
          I can’t believe you’re going
          through with this sham.

                    DEV
          You're one to talk, Mr. Building
          Engineer.

                    FREDDY
          And does that poor girl know?

                    DEV
          No. Well... she may possibly
          suspect. But probably no.

NEAR THE TABLES: Anamika leans forward - watching Freddy and
Dev as they speak privately with one another.
                                                              69.


                    ANAMIKA
          Who's that with Dev?

                    SANDEEP
          That's Freddy. He's come to visit.

Anamika watches as Freddy puts his hand on Dev's shoulder.

She raises her eyebrow.

                    ANAMIKA
          Oh.

ACROSS THE PARTY: Dev and Freddy continue speaking.

                    FREDDY
          And you haven't told Meena
          anything?

                    DEV
          She didn't tell me about you.

                    FREDDY
          Let's just tell everyone everything
          and be done with it.

                    DEV
          You heard my father. Strong values.
          Families coming together. He'd kill
          me. And he'd kill you. And the
          disappointment and embarrassment
          would kill him.

                    FREDDY
          That's a lot of dead bodies.

Freddy shakes his head and starts walking. Dev follows him.

                    FREDDY
               (looking back)
          Listen. I'm not sure I can take any
          more secrets.

Freddy flips back around, nearly running into:

Shree - who turns from her conversation to Freddy.

                    SHREE
          Oh Freddy. You really should meet
          Meena's childhood friend. This is
          Priya and her husband, Basu.

Freddy makes eye contact with Priya.
                                                               70.


Priya instantly straightens up and loudly proclaims:

                    PRIYA
          You're Meena's university friend in
          town whom I've never met before!

                    FREDDY
          Uh... right. Gosh, I'm meeting so
          many new people.

Looking up from his phone, Basu eyes Freddy.

                    BASU
          Wait. I know you.

                    PRIYA
               (shut up)
          No you don't.

                       BASU
          Sure I do.

Shree looks around. Very confused.

                    PRIYA
          No, Basu! You must stop that!
               (to Freddy and Shree)
          I'm so sorry. He thinks all white
          people look the same.

All eyes turn to Basu... who instantly nods his head.

                    BASU
          Oh. My bad bro.

And Basu returns back to browsing on his phone.

NEAR THE TABLES: With Sandeep and her mother gone, Anamika
sits all alone - eyeing Dev and Freddy across the party.

And behind her, at the table next to hers, sits Kabir.

They both stare off in the same direction. Toward Freddy and
Dev - now speaking to one another off to the side.

Kabir notices Anamika, and turns half-way to face her:

                    KABIR
          Oh hi. I'm Kabir. Congratulations--

                    ANAMIKA
          Do you know this Freddy fellow?
                                                          71.


                    KABIR
          Not really...
               (considering)
          But do you think there's something
          he's hiding?

                    ANAMIKA
          I'm afraid there may be.

                    KABIR
          You're right. Look. He's clearly
          here for... romantic reasons.

Still faced away from one another, Kabir doesn't notice
Anamika breathing deeply and shaking her head.

                       ANAMIKA
          I knew it.

                    KABIR
          And they're obviously keeping it a
          secret--

                    ANAMIKA
          Because people are so traditional--

                    KABIR
          I mean, I've kept relationships
          secret for the exact same reasons.

                    ANAMIKA
          Exact same? Oh my.

                    KABIR
          But see Freddy and I are after the
          same thing--

Anamika turns to face Kabir. She's shocked.

                       ANAMIKA
          Really?

                    KABIR
          But I won't let Freddy stand in my
          way if I'm actually starting to
          fall for this person.
               (beat)
          And it's not just because my dad is
          pressuring me into it.

Anamika's eyes go wide in bewilderment.
                                                                72.


                       KABIR
             Thank you. This was truly
             enlightening.

And Kabir walks off, leaving Anamika more confused than ever.

ACROSS THE PARTY: Freddy and Dev speak in hushed tones.

Until Freddy spots Kabir approaches and instantly peps up:

                       FREDDY
             So a building engineer is an expert
             in the design, construction, and
             maintenance of built environments.

                       DEV
             Wow, that definition sounds very
             accurate.

Kabir joins the two of them - facing Freddy directly.

                          FREDDY
             Hey Kabir.

                       KABIR
             Freddy. Listen, we need to talk--

But Kabir PAUSES as Sandeep walks up next to Freddy.

                       SANDEEP
             Hello boys!
                  (to Dev)
             Dev. Time for the speech.

                       DEV
             Papa, I'm not giving a speech.

                       SANDEEP
             This party is in your honor.
             Everyone’s here to celebrate you
             and... where’s Anamika anyway?

The four men turn toward the tables.

They spot Anamika sitting alone.

Dev waves.

She waves back - her face blank and her eyes wide.

                       SANDEEP
             Dev, someone needs to thank me for
             my party. I can't thank myself for
             my party.
                                                              73.


                    DEV
          Dad, I just don't feel comfortable.

Kabir throws an overly friendly hand on Sandeep's shoulder.

                    KABIR
          Let me say a few words. Introduce
          you and the happy couple. I truly
          don't mind.

                    SANDEEP
          That's very thoughtful, my boy.

Not to be outdone, Freddy also throws his hand on Sandeep's
shoulder.

                    FREDDY
          And I'll speak too. See, this boy's
          pretty thoughtful as well.

                    SANDEEP
          Right.

                    KABIR
          Sure. And then after I speak, I'll
          get the music started. Maybe show
          off my Punjabi dance moves, yeah?

                    FREDDY
          Sure. Or I could do that too.

Kabir faces Freddy directly.

                    KABIR
               (gritting his teeth)
          You're so helpful.

                    FREDDY
          No. You're so helpful.

Kabir and Freddy stare each other down.

Meanwhile, Sandeep stands in the middle. Very confused.

                    SANDEEP
          Yes. You're both so helpful.

ACROSS THE PARTY: Meena walks up to Priya and Basu.

                    PRIYA
          Hey Meena. I spoke with Freddy and
          I've had a change of heart. I think
          all of this is now really romantic.
                                                              74.


                       MEENA
          Seriously?

                    PRIYA
               (to Basu)
          You'd never fly to India for me.

                    BASU
          Why would I? You're already here.

Meena shakes her head, and begins looking around the party.

                    MEENA
          Wait. Where is Freddy?

She spins around and sees:

Freddy and Kabir standing on the dance floor.

                       MEENA
          Oh shit.

ON THE DANCE FLOOR: Kabir turns a microphone on and steps
forward, facing the crowd.

                    KABIR
          Hello New Delhi!
               (cheers from the crowd)
          Uncles and Aunties, you all look
          wonderful today! Now let's give it
          up for Dev and Anamika!

The crowd CHEERS as they all turn to find Dev and Anamika
standing an extremely awkward distance apart.

                    FREDDY
          Yes. And also, of course, we have
          to thank our host. Mr. Sandeep.
          He's so welcoming. Especially to
          me. So welcome and accepting and
          inviting.

                    KABIR
          Everyone, this is Freddy. He's a
          tourist from America and--

Kabir then seamlessly transitions into Hindi.

Freddy looks at Kabir as he monologues. In Hindi.

                    KABIR
               (looking at Freddy)
          Oh. That means... Well, it'd be
          hard to translate.
                    (MORE)
                                                                75.

                    KABIR (CONT’D)
               (to the crowd)
          But Freddy mentioned he wants to
          get the music started for us. And
          that he'd show us his dance moves.
               (to Freddy)
          Take it away.

And with that, Kabir smiles and walks off the dance floor.

Watching all this unfold, Meena is pissed.

                     MEENA
          Asshole.

Standing alone on the dance floor, Freddy looks out to the
crowd - as every eye stares back at him.

Except for Meena. She looks away. Unable to watch.

Freddy nods his head. Then he half-turns to the band, saying:

                    FREDDY
          Gaana bajaao.

Meena's eyes fly up toward Freddy - just as wind softly
starts to blow in her hair...

And the horns behind Freddy begin to play...

And a drummer starts beating a giant drum...

Freddy starts to snap his fingers in rhythm as the beat picks
up. And Freddy starts SINGING-- in Hindi!

He sings about how sometimes you have to take risks.
Sometimes you have to shake things up. Jump to the front of a
crowd. And sometimes, you have to be the Life Of The Party.

Meena is in shock and cannot believe what's happening.

And, frankly, neither can Freddy. He wears a giddy, wide
smile as he suddenly starts dancing.

Background dancers jump onto the dance floor, but Freddy goes
beat for beat alongside them. He's jumping, sliding, and
pumping his shoulders like any great Indian dancer.

Soon, Freddy races forward - dancing into the crowd. As he
moves, the crowd jumps on their feet around him.

Freddy keeps the energy up, dancing on top of tables - and
jumping from one table to the next.

Meena is in a state of blissful disbelief.
                                                                76.


Freddy, meanwhile, has danced his way up onto the bar. The
BARTENDER lobs a bottle of whiskey up to him. Freddy catches
it and immediately starts pouring drinks for nearby guests.

Sandeep, holding his own bottle of whiskey, is lifted up onto
the bar. As Freddy keeps singing, the two men clink their
bottles together and take a swig!

Jumping off the bar, Freddy discovers THE ENTIRE PARTY IS NOW
DANCING!

Guests. Drummers. Waiters. Young kids and uncles and aunties.

Freddy dances through the crowd, passing by Meena...

She's dancing too, headed in the other direction...

Meena spins back toward Freddy, and they criss-cross again...

Finally, Freddy and Meena circle one another, and the moment
seems to slow in time. Their eyes locked on one another.

And as Freddy dances off toward the dance floor for the BIG
FINALE FINISH, Meena watches him go with a smile on her face.

Meena is in love.


EXT. EVENT CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

The song has finished. The party is lively.

NEAR THE DANCE FLOOR, Freddy speaks with a GUEST - but his
gaze is elsewhere.

He spots Meena, standing across the party.

Freddy nods to the guest, and moves off - toward Meena.

When he's stopped--

Shree and two AUNTIES circle around Freddy.

                    SHREE
          Freddy! What wonderful dancing!

                    FREDDY
          Oh, thanks. Yeah I was just--

                    AUNTIE
          Are you single?

                    FREDDY
          I'm sorry. Am I--? ... Yes.
                                                              77.


                     AUNTIE
           My husband's business partner is
           American and he has a daughter...

                     FREDDY
           Oh. How nice.

Shree, noticing the air of awkwardness, cuts in.

                     SHREE
           Well, it was wonderful. Freddy, you
           had such joy inside. Really, you're
           such a good kid.

Shree lightly pats Freddy's cheek.

Freddy smiles. He turns to face--

Anamika.

She shyly looks up at Freddy.

                      ANAMIKA
                 (softly)
           I know your secret. And why you're
           here.

Freddy leans in nervously.

                     FREDDY
           You do?

                     ANAMIKA
           Yes. But I will not stand in the
           way of true love. Good luck to you.

Instantly overcome with emotion, Anamika throws her hands
over her face and rushes away.

Freddy stands alone - considering the previous exchange:

                      FREDDY
           Cool girl.
                (beat)
           Bit dramatic.


EXT. EVENT CENTER - LATER

Finally through the gauntlet of well-wishing guests, Freddy
and Meena meet at the center of the party.

They almost embrace, but with guests continually swirling
around them, they catch themselves.
                                                                78.


Instead, with a smile, Freddy walks up and stands next to
Meena. They stand side by side, looking out toward the crowd.

                    MEENA
          Why didn't you tell me you learned
          Hindi?

                    FREDDY
          I wanted it to be a surprise.
               (beat)
          Surprise.
               (beat)
          I can be the kind of man you want.
          I could even be the kind of man
          your parents want.

                    MEENA
          You honestly don't have to be
          anything you're not.

She turns to face him, and Freddy and Meena's eyes meet.

Their hands fall side by side, and her finger ever so
slightly touches his, before separating again.

She smiles.

                    MEENA
          Come with me.


EXT. EVENT CENTER - LATER

Off to the side, Meena holds the hand of a woman in her 70s.

This is her grandmother. Her NANI.

                    MEENA
          Nani, Freddy mera dost hai.

Meena turns and introduces her Nani to Freddy.

Freddy steps up toward her, putting his hands together to
greet her.

                     FREDDY
          Nani. Namaste. Apse milker bahut
          acha laga.

Meena takes a half step back as Freddy and Nani begin their
simple, yet very sweet, conversation.

Watching this seemingly impossible event unfold, Meena is
overwhelmed.
                                                                79.


EXT. WEDDING LOCATION - EVENING

Barefoot CONSTRUCTION WORKERS climb incredibly strong bamboo
shafts, fastening together the outer framework of a tent.

Nearby, Sandeep sits alone on a bench - silently watching as
they construct his son's wedding venue.

From behind, Freddy walks up to the bench. Before Sandeep can
acknowledge him, he sits.

Neither man immediately speaks. Instead, they just watch the
workmen build the tent from the ground up.

                    SANDEEP
          What can I help you with my boy?

                    FREDDY
          I wanted to thank you again for
          your hospitality.

                    SANDEEP
          No thank you necessary.
               (beat)
          But may I ask you something.

                    FREDDY
          Of course. Anything.

                    SANDEEP
          Does this tent look safe to you?
               (beat)
          In your professional opinion?

Freddy sheepishly looks off toward the tent.

                    FREDDY
          As a building engineer, I'd say...
          yes. But I would get a second
          opinion from a tent engineer.

Sandeep, confused, nods slowly and looks off toward the tent.

Slowly, Sandeep puts his head in his hands. He looks tired.

                    FREDDY
          You OK? Anything I can help with?

                    SANDEEP
          No. It's just Dev. I planned that
          event for him, and he didn't care.
          I planned this wedding for him, and
          he's dragging his feet.
                                                            80.


                    FREDDY
          Maybe he doesn't want things
          planned out for him. Like, say, an
          arranged marriage. Maybe he wants
          more.

                    SANDEEP
          More than what? Love? Because if
          you're with the right person, you
          will grow to love one another. And
          not just romantic love, which
          fades. But married love. Family
          love. Which is forever.

Sandeep turns and faces Freddy, fully engaging with him.

                    SANDEEP
          You know, it was much stricter in
          my day. You barely met the bride.
          With my son, I let him go on dates
          with the girls. Hell, I was just
          the matchmaker. But I guess he
          resented even that.
               (beat)
          He's so modern. Both of my kids.

                    FREDDY
          Is that bad?

                    SANDEEP
          No. It's amazing. It was my goal.
          To give them the life I never had.
          But I don't know how to find the
          balance between passing along my
          traditions and giving them their
          own future. I don't know.

Freddy nods, thinking hard before responding.

He pulls out his phone, pulls up his app, and hands it to
Sandeep.

                    FREDDY
          I've developed my own app. It's
          about architecture and history
          and... it's my passion.
               (beat)
          But I couldn't have done if...
          certain people didn't support me to
          make something on my own.

Sandeep scrolls through the app's features.

Freddy sheepishly looks down.
                                                                81.


                       SANDEEP
          Follow me.

Sandeep stands.

A moment later, Freddy follows.


EXT. QUTB MINAR - DAY

A massively tall minaret tower stands in the center of Delhi.

And Freddy stands below it - in complete awe.

He stumbles as he walks around it. Sandeep walks behind him.

                     SANDEEP
          Built in 1199, Qutb Minar is 240
          feet tall.

                    FREDDY
          It's incredible.

                    SANDEEP
          You know Delhi has the maximum
          number of historical buildings in
          the world. Number one! Humayan's
          Tomb. India Gate.

Freddy comes to a stop, looking up at the tower.

                    FREDDY
          Yeah. And I should probably see
          them all before that Kabir guy
          knocks them down.

Freddy looks over to Sandeep for his response, but Sandeep
remains stoic.

Until he eventually breaks, and CHUCKLES.

Freddy and Sandeep look back up at the tower. LAUGHING.


INT. ANAMIKA'S CAR - AFTERNOON

Anamika and her mother ride in the backseat of their family
car.

Lost in thought, Anamika looks out the window.

                    ANAMIKA
          Mummy, there's something you need
          to know.
                                                               82.


Anamika turns toward her mother...


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - MEENA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Meena enters her room, casually closing the door behind her.

But as soon as it shuts, she falls against the door, putting
her head in her hands and stomping her feet.

She works out every emotion. Shock. Passion. Excitement.
Giddiness. Literally everything plays out before our eyes.

But this is Meena. Calm. Collected. Logical.

So she slows her breath, and speaks softly to herself:

                    MEENA
          Yes, he flew to India. And yes, he
          learned Hindi. And yes, everyone
          likes him. And yes, that includes
          Nani. And she doesn't like anyone.

Meena paces around the room.

                    MEENA
          And yes he's sweet and charming and
          can dance. And yes, he takes my
          breath away. And yes, I missed him.
          And yes, I love him.

Meena stops in her tracks, but keeps speaking to herself.

                    MEENA
          And yes, I want to   be with him more
          than anything. And   yes, I want to
          spend my life with   him.
               (beat)
          But... I can't get   ahead of myself.

Meena takes a deep breath...


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

Meena BURSTS out from her room. HORNS blare. Her hair
dramatically BLOWS in the wind.

Now she's the one under the spell, dancing down her hallway
and around the upstairs of her house.

Her SONG is classic old-school Bollywood. Her previous
rationality has given way to lyrics full of poetic hyperbole
expressing her deep undying love for Freddy.
                                                                83.


Around the house, past the upstairs balcony, and through the
hallways, Meena dances and spins. And spins. And spins...

                                                 CUT TO:


EXT. FIELD - DAY

Meena looks around, no longer in her home.

Her daydream has taken her to a field of yellow flowers,
straight out of her favorite movie: Dilwale Dulhania Le
Jayenge.

She looks off in the distance. A man stands, turned away from
her. But it's not Shah Rukh Khan. It's FREDDY.

She runs toward him, and they embrace among the flowers...


INT. PALACE - NIGHT

But when they separate, they're no longer in the field. In
fact, they're no longer in color.

Meena has daydreamed herself into a 1940's Bollywood epic. In
full traditional outfits from centuries prior, Freddy and
Meena dance through the ornately decorated palace halls.

Freddy takes her by the hand, and spins her around...


EXT. FOREST POND - NIGHT

And now Meena finds herself near a moonlit pond. The
reflected lights sparkle in her eyes, like a heroine from a
Sanjay Leela Bhansali film.

Meena and Freddy stand at the edge of the pond. She looks
ahead, eyeing rocks in the water. Meena gracefully jumps from
one to the next. Following behind her, Freddy does the same.

Meena takes a leap from the final rock to shore...


EXT. TRAIN - DAY

Meena lands on a hard surface, barely able to balance
herself.

The wind BLOWS hard in her face. She looks around to find
herself on TOP OF A MOVING TRAIN!
                                                                84.


Turning around, she finds Freddy. And without missing a beat,
the two start dancing on top of the train as it moves through
the Indian countryside

They dance CLOSER and CLOSER to one another...

They arrive face to face...

And as the SMOKE from the train's engine envelopes around
them...


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - MEENA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Meena is back in her room as the music FADES AWAY.

On her bed, she looks at herself in the mirror.

A KNOCK at the door.

Meena stands as Sandeep opens the door.

                    SANDEEP
          We're going out for pani puri.

                    MEENA
          Great. Ek second.

Sandeep awkwardly pauses in the doorway.

                    SANDEEP
          I just want to say... I'm proud of
          you. And the work you've been
          doing. And I know you want to run
          the business... so let's start now.

Meena can't believe what she's hearing.

                    SANDEEP
          Modernize. Digitize. Globalize!
          Hell, we're an export company. We
          should have branches around the
          world. And you should start one.
               (beat)
          What about Chicago?

Caught off guard, Meena nods her head.

                    SANDEEP
          Anyway. Think about it.

He smiles and exits the room.

Meena stares off, considering the offer he's just made...
                                                                85.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

As cars and taxis WHIZZ by, Freddy stands with Meena's family
near a pani puri cart.

The PANI PURI VENDOR takes a crisp, hollow fried ball and
uses his thumb to poke a hole in it.

                    FREDDY
          Is this sanitary?

                    SHREE
          You'll be fine.

The vendor fills up the ball with spicy flavored water and
chaat masala and hands it over to Freddy.

                    DEV
          Just plop it right in your mouth.

Freddy does - rather in-eloquently - and the juice runs all
down his shirt.

Just then, a car pulls in behind the family. Its headlights
draw their attention.

The car door opens. Anamika's Mother exits. Anamika follows.

                    SANDEEP
          Ah hello! You didn't have to come
          here. We could've spoken at home.

                    ANAMIKA'S MOTHER
          This couldn't wait. I'm sorry...

Anamika's Mother searches for her words.

Anamika, meanwhile, stands quietly behind her.

                    ANAMIKA'S MOTHER
          You see. Marriage is like a
          retainer. If it doesn't fit
          properly after molding--

                    SANDEEP
          What's this about?

                    ANAMIKA'S MOTHER
          The wedding is off.

The group goes SILENT. Sandeep and Shree share a worried
glance. Dev looks to Anamika, who looks down at her feet.
                                                               86.


                    SANDEEP
          Off? Wait. Why?

                     ANAMIKA'S MOTHER
          We have a difference in family
          values. And... and... and because
          of Freddy.

All eyes land on Freddy - who is quite shocked and confused.

                    ANAMIKA'S MOTHER
          He's been lying to you about why
          he's here. Making a fool of you.

                    FREDDY
          You... you know why I'm here?

                    ANAMIKA'S MOTHER
          Yes. Because you're in love.
               (beat)
          With Dev.

The group processes this information.

Freddy lets out a brief, relieved CHUCKLE.

                    FREDDY
          What? I'm-- no. No no no. I like
          Dev. He's great. But no.

                    SANDEEP
               (smiling)
          With Dev? Are you mad?

Shree, however, does not find any of this amusing.

                    SHREE
          Freddy. What were you going to say?
          Why are you here?

Everyone once again turns to face Freddy.

He gathers his thoughts. Does he lie? Tell the truth?

But it's Meena who closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.

                    MEENA
          Enough.
               (beat)
          He came here for me. Freddy and I
          dated back in America. We were in
          love. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

The sounds of TAXIS and BUSES fill the deep SILENCE.
                                                             87.


Off to the side, Anamika stares off into space, putting it
all together.

                    ANAMIKA
          Oh... yeah... that make sense.

Sandeep looks from Freddy to Meena in shock.

Sandeep methodically returns to Freddy. Remaining calm...

                    SANDEEP
          Freddy. I'll kindly ask you to not
          return back home with us.

                    MEENA
          Papa, let me explain--

                    SANDEEP
          No!
               (beat)
          No. Freddy. Leave now. Just go.

                    MEENA
          Why are you doing this?

                    SANDEEP
               (re: Anamika's Mother)
          Let's not discuss this here.

                    MEENA
          No. Let's discuss this. Is it
          because he's American?

                    SANDEEP
          It's not. No. No, it's because--

                    MEENA
          Because he's different? And doesn't
          have the approval of your friends
          and cousins and business partners.
               (beat)
          And because you didn't pick him!

                    SANDEEP
          It's my house, so if I don't want
          him there, he's not welcome!

                    MEENA
          Then I'll go with him.

Shree takes a step forward.

                    SHREE
          Don't you dare leave.
                                                              88.


Meena stares her mother down--

                       FREDDY
          Stop.

Meena looks to Freddy.

Tears welling in his eyes, Freddy looks at the angry and
confused faces around him.

Sandeep. Shree. Meena.

                    FREDDY
          This isn't what I wanted.
               (to Meena)
          I'm not going to do this to you.
          I'm so sorry.

Eyes locked on each other, Freddy and Meena share a final
moment--

Before he turns and walks away.

Freddy hails a taxi--

He turns back around, as the entire family stares back. He
then ducks into the back of the taxi.


INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

Freddy stares straight ahead.

                    FREDDY
          Mujhe hostel jaana hai.

As the taxi takes off, he looks out the window.

Devastated, he wipes his eyes.


EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Back on the street corner, Meena stares off toward Freddy's
departing taxi.

                    SANDEEP
          Why did you do this to us?

Meena turns. Pissed.

                    MEENA
          I'm doing this to you?
                                                              89.


                    SANDEEP
          Yes. We're hurt. Deeply hurt that
          our daughter lived across the world
          from us living a secret life.

                    MEENA
          Have you even bothered to ask how
          I'm feeling? Because I love him! I
          do. And I want to marry him.
               (beat)
          How can either of you want anything
          less than my happiness?

Sandeep nearly responds... But can't.

His stare is locked on Meena.

                    SHREE
          Don't turn this around on us.

Meena and Sandeep turn to face Shree, as she steps forward.

                    SHREE
          You lied to us for a year. Then you
          came home, and lied to our faces.
          And when this boy showed up, your
          first instinct was to make him lie.

Meena looks off - embarrassed.

                    SHREE
          And you do all this - you cause all
          these distractions for us and for
          poor Anamika's family - only days
          before your brother's wedding.

                    ANAMIKA
          Wait.
               (beat)
          The wedding is back on then?

                    SANDEEP
          Yes.

                    DEV
          No.

The group SILENTLY turns to Dev, stepping forward from his
position off to the side.

                    DEV
          I'm sorry, but no.
               (to Sandeep)
          I haven't been honest with you.
                    (MORE)
                                                             90.

                    DEV (CONT’D)
               (to Anamika)
          I don't want to get married.

                       SANDEEP
          Why not?

                    DEV
          I want to be with someone else.
          Someone you don't know.

Dev collects his thoughts.

Takes a deep breath.

And looks up toward his father.

                    DEV
          His name is Raj.

COMPLETE SILENCE.

Meena tilts her head, smiling at her brother.

                       MEENA
          Oh Dev.

But this sweet moment is broken as--

Shree turns and leaves.

She walks toward their car, steps into the back, and SLAMS
the door shut.

Anamika looks up toward her mother...

Who takes her hand and walks her away from the group...

Anamika looks back toward Dev. She mouths "I'm sorry"...

But Sandeep remains.

Frozen in place, he stares off toward the street.

                    SANDEEP
          We're all upset and we're saying
          things we don't mean--

                       DEV
          Papa.

                    SANDEEP
          We're saying things that we don't
          mean! Things that we can't mean.
                                                                91.


Shaking his head, Sandeep stumbles past Meena and toward the
car - stepping into the backseat with Shree.

Meena and Dev are left alone. They share a glance as the
SOUNDS of the New Delhi street overwhelm them.


INT. HOSTEL - MORNING

A MAN exits a small shared bathroom, and walks past...

A common area where a GROUP OF MEN sit around a TV, SCREAMING
LOUDLY at a cricket match. The man then moves past...

A front desk where the HOSTEL OWNER sits, reading the paper,
while a nearby radio PLAYS Hindi music from decades ago...

And finally we reach Freddy, sitting at a table across from
an OLDER INDIAN MAN pouring a glass of water.

The man offers it to Freddy, who looks at it and SIGHS.

                    FREDDY
          At this point, why the hell not.
               (beat)
          Haan. Shukriya.

Freddy accepts the glass and eyes it suspiciously.

He nearly takes a drink when--

His phone BUZZES. He answers:

                       FREDDY
          Hello?


INT. DELHI BAR - DAY

Sitting at a table in the middle of an empty bar, Freddy
stares down an untouched Kingfisher beer.

                    FREDDY
          Thanks for calling. The hostel I
          was in last night was... not great.
          And you're literally the only other
          people I know here.

Sitting across from Freddy are Priya and Basu.

                    BASU
               (nudging Priya)
          I told you I knew him.
                                                               92.


Priya shakes her head, ignoring her husband.

                    PRIYA
          It's fine. We're happy to talk.

                    FREDDY
          I-- I don't know what to do. I feel
          like I have nothing. No Meena. No
          sense of direction. No wallet. No
          battery in my freaking phone!

Freddy frantically pulls a charging cable from his pocket.

                    FREDDY
          My charger won't fit in any plugs!

Completely exhausted, Freddy puts his head in his hands.

                    FREDDY
          You know Meena. You know what she's
          going through. What should I do?
          Should I stay here? Maybe like a
          big, giant, grand gesture thing?

                    PRIYA
          Do you want to stay here?

                    FREDDY
          I want to be wherever she is.

Priya PAUSES - his words mirroring Meena's.

                    PRIYA
          ... then maybe ...

As Priya thinks of what to say, Basu looks up from his phone
and right at Freddy.

                    BASU
          Why did you learn Hindi and fly to
          India? Why do you want her family’s
          approval? Because the hard thing to
          do was the right thing to do.

Freddy nods his head.

Priya is in shock at the sheer eloquence of her husband.

                    BASU
          But now. Meena knows how you feel.
          And leaving and giving her space...
          that might be the hardest thing to
          do. But it would also be the right
          thing to do.
                                                               93.


Priya, sneaking a proud side-glance at Basu, takes over.

                    PRIYA
          Yeah... what he said.
               (beat)
          And if you need help with the
          flight, Basu has unlimited miles--

                    BASU
          Babe, it's an allowance!
               (to Freddy)
          But yeah, bro. You can have some.

Freddy smiles. He looks to the Kingfisher beer in front of
him. He reaches out and takes a sip - considering the offer.


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - DEV'S ROOM - DAY

Dev sits alone on the edge of his bed.

Sultan jumps up on the bed, and the dog snuggles in beside
him. Dev pets Sultan, but even this offers no respite to the
pain he feels.

In the doorway, Meena watches.

Heartbroken, she walks in and sits beside him.

Staring off toward a far wall, he barely acknowledges her.

                    MEENA
          Dev. You're amazing. I mean that.

He looks up at her.

                    MEENA
          And... I think I always suspected.
          Or thought. But anyway. I'm really
          happy I know.

She takes his hand in hers.

                    MEENA
          Now. Show me a picture of him.

He hesitates briefly, before pulling out his phone.

He opens a picture, and hands the phone to Meena.

                    MEENA
          Oh. He's cute
               (beat)
          You love him?
                                                                94.


Dev nods.

                      MEENA
            Then be with him. And tell everyone
            to go to hell. And--

                       DEV
            And be a hero? Love conquers all?
            Like in the songs?
                 (singing)
            Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya
                 (translating)
            If I'm in love, then why should I
            be afraid?
                 (beat)
            I'm afraid because I saw how they
            looked at me. They'll never, ever
            accept it.

Meena looks away, hoping - for several reasons - that what
he's saying is not true.

                      DEV
            I wish I thought otherwise. But I
            don't anymore.

She nods her head, closing his phone and handing it back.


EXT. WEDDING LOCATION - DAY

Workers, standing atop the canvas roof towering 30 feet above
the ground, slowly deconstruct the wedding tent.

Sandeep watches from the same bench as before. He looks
exhausted. Worried.

He notices someone approaching, and momentarily looks off,
before returning his gaze back to the tent.

Freddy stands next to him.

Freddy takes a moment to gather his courage, and sits.

And for a few seconds, the two men sit in SILENCE.

                      FREDDY
            I'm sorry I lied. I truly am.
                 (beat)
            So here's the truth. I'm not a
            building engineer. Or your
            daughter's schoolmate.
                 (beat)
            I'm the man who's in love with her.
                                                           95.


Freddy looks for a reaction from Sandeep.

Sandeep keeps staring ahead.

So Freddy continues:

                     FREDDY
           There's a few more things. I may
           not come from a rich, well
           connected family, but you'd like
           them a lot.
                (beat)
           My mom and dad wanted to call you.
           Sort everything out. I said it's a
           bit more complicated than that.

SILENCE.

                     FREDDY
           And... I'm not Indian. Obviously.
                (beat)
           So you're disappointed that things
           haven't gone the way you imagined.
           That the life you gave your kids
           seems so unrecognizable.

Sandeep takes a pained breath, but-- still says nothing.

                     FREDDY
           But, for what it's worth, you
           raised good kids. Good Indian kids.
           Loving. Caring. Family-oriented.
           Who want to be with loving, caring,
           family-oriented people.

Freddy takes a deep breath. His confidence now regained.

                     FREDDY
           And I want to marry her...

Freddy stands, preparing to leave.

Sandeep barely acknowledges him.

                     FREDDY
           Can you do me a favor? Cause I know
           I've done enough intruding. And I
           wanna leave any decisions to her.

Finally, Sandeep turns and faces Freddy.

                     FREDDY
           Can you tell her I'm leaving Delhi?

                    FREDDY (CONT’D)
          And tell her I hope I'll see again.
               (beat)
          Anyway. Bye Sandeep.

And with that, Freddy walks away.

Sandeep turns his attention back to the tent. His stare as
indecipherable as before...


EXT. MEENA'S HOUSE - EVENING

On her driveway, Meena stares up at the gigantic metal gate.

She walks toward it, motioning to the guard.

                    MEENA
          Open the gate.

The guard nods and opens the gate.

Meena walks a few steps ahead before--

                    SHREE (O.S.)
          Close the gate.

Meena flips around and faces her mother. Shocked and pissed,
she motions to the guard.

                    MEENA
               (to the guard)
          Don't.
               (to Shree)
          What is your problem?

                    SHREE
          You're making a scene.

                    MEENA
          No. What exactly is your problem?
          Your issue with Freddy. Please--
          please explain it to me!

Shree, taken a back by her daughter's tone, steps toward her.

                    SHREE
          I don't know him. I don't know his
          culture.

                    MEENA
          Who cares about culture?
                                                                97.


                    SHREE
          Culture is tradition! And tradition
          is what I followed to have the life
          I love. To have you. Now, would I
          prefer if he were Indian? Of
          course! Because then I would know
          his values.

                    MEENA
          Oh, because Americans don't have
          values.

                    SHREE
          Don't turn me into the bad guy!

                    MEENA
               (motioning to the gate)
          You're literally trying to trap me
          behind a gate!

In control of the conversation, Meena steps toward Shree.

                    MEENA
          Growing up, I loved watching movies
          with you. And cheering on the
          heroes to fall in love.
               (beat)
          And it didn't matter if he was from
          a village or a different state. Or
          if the parents disapproved.

Shree looks away, suddenly overcome with thoughts. Memories.

                                                 CUT TO:


INT. MEENA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK

Shree cuddles on a couch next to an 8-year-old MEENA, as they
lean in watching Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.

On-screen: a young WOMAN watches as the young MAN she loves
stands on a departing train. She runs toward him, but her
hand is grasp by her stern-looking FATHER.

                    MEENA (V.O.)
          How many times did we watch DDLJ?
          And at the end, as he's taking off
          on the train and Amrish Puri grabs
          Kajol's hand... Holding her back...

Glued to their circa-1998 TV, Shree and Meena yell at the
screen for the father to let her run and catch the train.
                                                                98.


                    MEENA (V.O.)
          We would yell and scream for him to
          let her go. To let her be with him.
          And then...

On-screen: the father looks from his daughter, to her lover
pulling away on the train. A close-up on his face as he...
releases her arm.

Meena's young face lights up.

On-screen: the father looks down at his daughter and says:

                    THE FATHER
               (from the film)
          Ja, beta. Ja.
               (subtitles)
          Go, my child. Go.

Meena claps wildly as she watches the woman on-screen run off
toward the love of her life.

Shree looks down at her daughter...

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAYS EARLIER

A flashback to days earlier, as Shree and Meena watched the
same film together.

Shree looks down at her daughter, and smiles...

                                                  CUT TO:


EXT. MEENA'S HOUSE - EVENING

Only moments have passed, but Shree stands dead in her
tracks, staring straight ahead at Meena. Breathing deeply and
trying her best to conceal the confusion she's feeling.

Meena faces Shree, shaking her head.

                    MEENA
          Ja, beta. Ja.
               (beat)
          You're too afraid to let me go.

In SILENCE, they stare at one another.

Shree nearly responds, when...
                                                                99.


A car pulls up the driveway.

As it parks, Sandeep exits - on the phone.

                    SANDEEP
          Yeah yeah. See you soon.

He hangs up the phone, and turns to Meena and Shree. He's
either oblivious to the fight, or unwilling to engage.

                    SANDEEP
          We have dinner plans.

                       MEENA
          With whom?

Sandeep looks back at Meena. His silence says it all.

                    MEENA
               (pissed)
          Papa. Seriously?

                    SANDEEP
          It's just for business. He wants to
          sign the deal tonight. And they'll
          expect the whole family to be
          there.

From the doorway of the house, Dev exits timidly.

                       DEV
          Even me?

Sandeep turns, and barely acknowledges his son.

                    SANDEEP
          Yeah. I don't want anything to
          seem... off.

Meena shakes her head, and turns to Shree--

Shree stares back - their fight still lingering in the air.


EXT. DELHI BAR - DUSK

Priya and Basu walk toward their car - their DRIVER holding a
door open for them.

Freddy slows down a few steps behind them.

                    PRIYA
          If you want, we can drop you off at
          the airport.
                    (MORE)
                                                                100.

                    PRIYA (CONT’D)
               (beat)
          Unless there's somewhere else you'd
          like to go.

Freddy looks off toward wherever the hell Meena is.


INT. FINE DINING RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Meena sits at a table in an extremely fancy restaurant,
staring down at her untouched five-star meal.

Beside her, Sandeep, Shree, and Dev all appear in various
stages of shock and exhaustion from the previous 24 hours.

Across from them, KABIR'S FATHER holds court - proudly
discussing his own achievements.

On one side of him, Kabir nods his head as his father speaks.
On the other side, KABIR'S MOTHER smiles dutifully.

                    KABIR'S FATHER
          They said it couldn't be done. Said
          it was impossible. But I did it. By
          God I did it. I created the largest
          plastic bottling plant for sodas
          and mineral water in the state!

Kabir proudly turns to Meena - who is completely checked out.

Shree and Dev, meanwhile, politely pick at their food.

Kabir's mother maintains the exact same smile as before.

So with no real reaction, Kabir's father keeps monologue-ing.

                    KABIR'S FATHER
          And when we expanded--
               (to Sandeep)
          Sandeep, you'll love this!

Sandeep forces an interested smile onto his face.

                    KABIR'S FATHER
          When we expanded, there was some
          little temple next door--

                    KABIR
          Oh, I already told them, Papa.

                       KABIR'S FATHER
          Boom!
                  (laughing)
                       (MORE)
                                                                101.

                    KABIR'S FATHER (CONT’D)
          I mean, it wasn't really a
          temple... Well, it was. But you
          know these religious types.
          Beggars, all of them. So... BOOM!

Kabir and his father turn and LAUGH with one another.

But when Kabir turns back to Meena: still no reaction.

                    KABIR
          So, Meena. Did your buddy leave for
          America yet?

Meena looks up at Kabir - speechless.

                    KABIR'S FATHER
          Who's this?

                    KABIR
          Some American tourist friend.

                    SANDEEP
          He's leaving tonight.

Meena, surprised, turns to Sandeep.

                    SANDEEP
               (softly, to Meena)
          He spoke with me.
               (beat)
          But he's probably already gone.

Meena nods. Accepting the inevitable.

Oblivious, Kabir's Father continues his endless one-man-show.

                    KABIR'S FATHER
          Americans. I've worked with them
          all. Extreme lack of culture.
          Barely speak to their families. No
          values whatsoever.

Shree looks up, hearing her own words tossed back at her.

                    KABIR'S FATHER
          But we Indians have our traditions.
          Our culture's intact.
               (to Sandeep)
          You and I, Sandeep, we can pass
          along these values because our
          children listen and do what we say.

Sandeep nods, continuing to bear this unbearable man.
                                                               102.


                    KABIR'S FATHER
          My son understands that his father
          knows best, and whatever he does,
          he must hold up my name.

Off to the side, Dev sinks lower into his seat.

Kabir's Father SLAPS his son on the back.

                    KABIR'S FATHER
          I've given Kabir everything. His
          whole life's taken care of. It'll
          be... easy.

Meena looks up.

                                                    CUT TO:


INT. 'L' TRAIN - FLASHBACK

She remembers their first date, as Freddy stands before her:

                    FREDDY
          It may not be easy. But what you
          said about speaking from the
          heart... well I want to see where
          this goes. Cause I've got a good
          feeling about it.

                                                    CUT TO:


INT. FINE DINING RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

Lost in the memory, a smile crosses Meena's face.

                    KABIR'S FATHER (O.S.)
          Meena? Meena?

And then she SMASHES back to reality - as the entire table
stares at her.

                    KABIR'S FATHER
          I said, what do you think of that?

Meena looks around the table.

Kabir. Kabir's Father. Kabir's Mother.

Meena looks to Sandeep. To Dev. To Shree.

She nods her head, as if to answer, and--
                                                             103.


Meena stands up.

                    MEENA
          I'm sorry. I have to go.

Shree and Sandeep trade a quick worried glance.

                    MEENA
          There's someone I need to see.

Meena turns to leave when--

Shree GRABS her wrist.

Meena looks down at Shree's hand wrapped around her arm.

And as quickly as she grabbed her wrist--

Shree releases it.

                    SHREE
          Ja, beta. Ja.

Every emotion hits Meena simultaneously. Joy. Shock. Love.

Unable to take her eyes off her mother, Meena stumbles
backwards away from the table.

She smiles toward Shree, and finally turns and RUNS.

From his seat, Sandeep watches Meena leave the restaurant.

He then takes his napkin, wipes his mouth, lays it on the
table, and stands.

                    SANDEEP
          I better go with her. Too late to
          take a taxi alone.
               (beat)
          Also, the deal's off. I believe we
          may have a difference of values.
               (beat)
          And your bottles are cheap.

And with that, Sandeep heads toward the exit.

Kabir and his father turn from Sandeep... to Shree.

She shrugs and stands.

                    SHREE
          Well, I suppose I better join them.

Shree turns to Dev. She looks at him for a beat.
                                                                104.


                       SHREE
             Are you coming or not?

Dev pauses, unsure how to react... Before Shree rolls her
eyes, smiles, and motions to the door.

Dev smiles.


INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

Meena, Sandeep, Shree, and Dev are all jammed in the back of
a very small auto-ricksaw taxi.

The taxi WHIZZES through the crowded streets of Delhi.

Sandeep leans forward, yelling at the driver.

                       SANDEEP
             Take a right, you bloody fool.

The driver jerks the wheel and takes a hard right.

Meena, nervously looking out the window, shakes her head.

                       SANDEEP
             If he went straight to the airport,
             we've already missed him.

Meena perks up, and turns to Sandeep.

                       MEENA
             He wouldn't go straight to the
             airport.
                  (to the driver)
             Take a left! Now-- now please!!

The driver nods and jerks the wheel, taking a hard left.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

As the taxi SCREECHES to a halt, Meena jumps out.

She's surrounded by people. Walking around. Taking pictures.

Meena wades through the crowd, looking for Freddy everywhere.

She pushes through a crowd of people, when she sees it:

INDIA GATE

A sandstone arch monument in the heart of New Delhi. Yes,
it's a little tourist-y. It's also incredibly beautiful.
                                                            105.


But Meena looks everywhere. And cannot find Freddy.

Dwarfed below the massive arch, Meena hangs her head. She
closes her eyes, feeling the loss all over again.

When--

                    FREDDY (O.S.)
          Meena?

For a moment, she doesn't believe it.

But she turns, and there he is.

Freddy motions up to the massive monument.

                    FREDDY
          I had to see it before I left.
               (beat)
          You were right. It's special.

With a big smile, Freddy steps toward Meena--

But she holds up a hand.

                    MEENA
          No songs. No dances. No big
          speeches. Just... talk to me.

                    FREDDY
          OK. Let's talk.

Meena pauses a BEAT, collecting her thoughts.

                    MEENA
          I shouldn't have left America
          without fighting for us.

                    FREDDY
          I shouldn't have come to India
          unannounced.

                    MEENA
          I should have said so many things
          to you--

                    FREDDY
          I should listened better--

                    MEENA
          I know things have been difficult--

                    FREDDY
          It's only made me more certain--
                                                              106.


                    MEENA
          That I want to spend the rest of my
          life with you.

Freddy takes a step forward.

                    FREDDY
          Well, I want to marry you.

Meena takes a step forward. Face to face with Freddy.

                    MEENA
          I want to marry you too.

Inches apart, Freddy looks into her eyes. He leans in...

Meena tilts her head to kiss him before--

Her eyes slowly open, and she looks off to the side.

                      MEENA
          Freddy.

She motions to her right.

As her ENTIRE FAMILY watches from the nearby taxi.

Freddy waves to them.

                    FREDDY
          You brought your family?

                    MEENA
          Get used to it.

Both Meena and Freddy straighten up as Sandeep, Shree, and
Dev walk up to the pair.

Freddy in particular braces himself for Sandeep.

                    FREDDY
          Sandeep. There's something I want
          to tell you--

                    MEENA
          Papa, we want to get married. And I
          know that not everyone will accept
          this, but--

                      SANDEEP
          Nonsense!

Sandeep grabs Freddy for a hug, rocking him back and forth.
                                                                107.


                    SANDEEP
          Freddy. You're part of the family
          now. Which means you're Indian now.
          Which means we're not going to let
          anyone give you any shit for not
          being Indian. You understand?

                    FREDDY
          I think so?

                    SHREE
          When shall we have the wedding?

                    MEENA
          Mummy, we just got engaged--

Meena looks incredulous, trying to process her parents'
sudden change of heart.

                    MEENA
          Oh my God, this is so weird. So
          we're all good?

                    FREDDY
               (to Shree)
          Uh... we don't know. I mean, I'd
          marry her tomorrow if I could.

                     SANDEEP
          Why not?

                    MEENA
          Oh God, Papa. How?

                    SANDEEP
          You know, there may be a tent
          available...

Sandeep turns and nods toward Dev:

                    SANDEEP
          ... since my son's not getting
          married this week.

                    DEV
               (smiling)
          Yeah... And you did essentially
          plan the whole wedding.

Meena, still freaking out (but also potentially weighing this
new, insane option in her mind), turns to Freddy.
                                                                108.


                    FREDDY
          Well, that's great. But I can't get
          married without my family.

Sandeep and Shree share the briefest of smiles, as--

                    PRIYA (O.S.)
          Wait!

Priya and Basu (head down in his phone) walk up to the group.

                    PRIYA
          We can get them all here. Your mum.
          Your dad. Your cousins.

                    FREDDY
          I have a lot of cousins.

                    PRIYA
          Well, Basu has unlimited miles--

Basu perks up.

                    BASU
          I don't have--!

He looks around the group... and toward Priya.

                    PRIYA
          Please, love.

Basu PAUSES then returns to his phone. Dialing a number.

                    BASU
          Chacha, aap kaise ho?
               (beat)
          So you know my miles allowance?
               (a painful beat)
          I'm going to need... all of them.

Priya looks to Freddy.

Freddy looks to Meena.

She takes a deep breath, and smiles back.

Drums. Horns. And MUSIC.

The song: WE ARE FAMILY by Sister Sledge - the greatest
American wedding song of all time. BUT, it's been given a
Bollywood remix, with Hindi lyrics and tabla drums pounding.
And just as the song kicks into high gear...
                                                                109.


INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Hotel lobby doors open, and Freddy leads his mother, father,
and entire extended family inside...

Where they are instantly met and embraced by Sandeep, Shree,
and their entire extended family.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Meena sits facing a mirror as her make-up is applied. Meena
holds out an empty champagne glass...

As it's filled up by Shree, sitting beside her and having her
own make-up applied.


EXT. WEDDING SITE - AFTERNOON

MUSICIANS pound drums, WAITERS serve drinks from trays, and
several HANDLERS walk down a road leading a GIANT ELEPHANT.

Freddy - dressed in full Indian wedding attire - looks up at
the elephant, wondering how he's supposed to ride it.

Freddy turns to Dev, who offers his hand and helps Freddy up
onto the elephant.


EXT. WEDDING SITE - EVENING

The BAND of DRUMMERS and MUSICIANS leads the baraat parade...

Followed by Freddy's entire family dancing to the music...

And concluding with Freddy waving his arms on top of the
elephant like he's freaking Aladdin!

They pass by a hotel, and looking out from her balcony...

Meena - wearing a stunning red lehenga - looks down at
Freddy. On top of an elephant. In India. She's overjoyed.

Freddy looks up. They lock eyes.

Time slows...


INT. WEDDING TENT - NIGHT

Spotlights swing toward the tent's entrance, as the sides are
pulled open, revealing Meena and Freddy, arm in arm. Married.
                                                                  110.


And as the MUSIC keeps playing, a MONTAGE takes us through
their evening:

Freddy and Meena dance slowly on the dance floor - until
Freddy spins her out just as the CHORUS hits...

And Freddy and Meena dance to the beat. Freddy especially
shows off those dance moves that initially won her over...

Sandeep and Shree sit and laugh with Freddy's parents...

Meena and Shree dance side by side, spinning around as their
outfits flow in unison...

Freddy sits with Meena's Nani, just talking...

Freddy and his father take over the dance floor with a dance-
off, proving who can move their feet faster than the other...

Sandeep approaches Dev, who's speaking with a handsome young
man: RAJ. After a pause, Sandeep extends his hand and
introduces himself to Raj. Dev is shocked and thrilled...

By now, everyone is dancing. And I mean everyone. Over 300
people, all moving in unison to the music...

In front, Freddy and Meena lead the dance - which is itself a
mix of old-school jazz moves and Punjabi shoulder thrusts.
Everything's a little mixed up, but also kind of perfect...

And as the   MUSIC hits its crescendo, Meena pulls out her
phone. She   turns it around for a selfie with Freddy. But
before she   can take it, Sandeep and Shree and Dev all push
themselves   into the frame. And just as Freddy glances down at
Meena with   a smile...

SNAP!

                                                   CUT TO:

The family photo now hangs on Meena and Freddy's
refrigerator, surrounded by dozens of photos of their life
together...

                      THE END
