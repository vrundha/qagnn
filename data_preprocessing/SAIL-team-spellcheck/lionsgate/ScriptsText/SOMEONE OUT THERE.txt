                             ACT ONE

  EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES STREET - NIGHT

  As sentimental rom-com music swells, DEREK LOWE (30s,
  charming, hidden sweetness) dashes down a busy street. He
  ruins his expensive suit as he pushes past confused
  pedestrians, plows through a puddle, leaps over a dog. He’s a
  man on a mission. Who is he running towards? Is it...

  INT. DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

  CHLOE CROSS, (30s, cool, no-nonsense) who wears an
  exquisitely-crafted wedding dress. She paces back and forth,
  looking worried. She checks the time, bites her lip. Sits
  down. Gets up. Starts pacing some more. Has she been left at
  the altar? Maybe by...

  EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES STREET - SAME TIME

  Derek, who’s still running. He skids to a halt in front of an
  office building, noticing some purple lilies in a flower bed.
  Getting an idea, he jumps into the flower bed, grabs the
  lilies by the root, and pulls. They don’t budge. Frowning, he
  pulls again. Nothing. He adjusts his grip.

                      DEREK
                (all his might)
            NNNNNRRRGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
                (giving up)
            Jesus Christ in Heaven!

  Derek notices the building’s LANDSCAPE GUY, watching him.

                      DEREK (CONT’D)
            Did you plant these? You did an
            excellent job, sir! Hats off to
            you.

  The guy shrugs. Derek composes himself, adjusts his tie. He
  looks at a modern-looking building across the street. Derek
  approaches a door and knocks three times...

  INT. STORE - SAME TIME

  Bang bang bang! Relief washes over Chloe’s face. She runs up
  to the door, opens it, and finds...SYDNEY KOH, 22, a purple-
  haired millennial holding two giant burritos.

                      CHLOE
            Finally! I’m starving!
2nd Network Revised                                         2.


                      SYDNEY
            Gah! What the hell are you doing in
            the wedding dress, you psycho?

                      CHLOE
            Sssssh! Gimme burrito!

  Sydney hands over the burrito and follows Chloe inside.
  REVEAL they are in “CHLOE”, a fancy downtown bridal boutique.
  Chloe isn’t a bride. She’s a dressmaker. Sydney watches as
  Chloe starts shoving the burrito into her mouth.

                      CHLOE (CONT’D)
                (mouth full)
            I shkip lunch tah finsh the
            embroideruh...
                (swallows, then)
            And I put it on because a wedding
            dress isn’t something that you view
            in a museum. It will have a bride
            inside, in this case a rich lady
            named Priscilla --

                      SYDNEY
            “Priscilla.” What kind of name is
            that? Cis white women are truly the
            sickest people out there.

                      CHLOE
            -- and Priscilla is going to be
            moving and dancing and laughing and
            probably puking at the end of the
            night. So I need to see it flow.

  Chloe heads to a mirror and starts dancing in front of it.

                      CHLOE (CONT’D)
            See? Check out my flow.

  Chloe does a bunch of bad dance moves very confidently.
  Sydney watches her and laughs.

                      SYDNEY
            You are a terrible dancer.

                      CHLOE
            Am not. Twerk. Nae nae. Finish with
            the Beyonce booty roll I studied
            online hip extension boom!

  It’s no Beyonce. Sydney is unimpressed.
2nd Network Revised                                        3.


  EXT. JEWELRY STORE - SAME TIME

  Derek bangs on the door of a high-end jewelry store. MARIA,
  an employee, approaches from inside the store.

                      MARIA
            We’re closed.

                      DEREK
            I just need one second.

                      MARIA
            Sorry, you’ll have to come back
            tomorrow.

  In response, Derek mimes begging. He makes prayer hands. He
  runs a finger down his cheeks as if he’s crying. He gets on
  his knees, making his best puppy-dog face. Maria rolls her
  eyes but smiles, charmed, and opens the door.

  INT. JEWELRY STORE - MOMENTS LATER

  Derek picks out some nice earrings, holds them out to Maria.

                      DEREK
            Do you mind?

  Maria shrugs, and puts the earrings on. Derek smiles.

                      DEREK (CONT’D)
            You look great. We should steal
            those earrings and go.

                      MARIA
            “Go”... where?

                      DEREK
            To Otium. Our reservation is at 8.
            We should just be able to make it.

                      MARIA
                (confused)
            Sorry, what? You’re here for me?

                      DEREK
            Yeah. I get coffee across the
            street every day and yesterday we
            smiled at each other.
                (pointing at his smile)
            Remember?

                      MARIA
                (warming, playful)
            Maybe...
2nd Network Revised                                        4.


                      DEREK
            Tonight I was at a party twenty
            blocks away for a terrible movie I
            wrote the music for, listening to
            someone drone on about the long-
            term benefits of index funds, when
            I thought “This isn’t fun. What
            would be?” So here we are.

                      MARIA
            Okay. But you made dinner
            reservations before I said yes?
            Isn’t that a little cocky?

                      DEREK
            I don’t like the term “cocky”.
            That makes me feel like a 80s
            fighter pilot who’s about to be
            chewed out by someone named Colonel
            Strong. I’m more...an optimist.
            I’m hoping that I can take a
            beautiful woman out to a nice
            dinner where I’m happy to discuss
            anything in the universe except
            index funds. Like, I don’t know,
            sailboats. Do you have one?

                        MARIA
                  (laughing)
            No.

                      DEREK
            Me neither. See, this is already
            going great!

  Maria smiles and grabs her coat, swept up in Derek’s energy.
  They head out together.

  INT. CHLOE - SAME TIME

  Chloe, still in the dress, hands Sydney her phone.

                      CHLOE
            Hey, take a picture of me. We
            should put this on the store’s
            Instagram page.

                      SYDNEY
                (mocking her)
            “Instagram page.”
                (taking phone, tapping)
            What filters do 40-year-olds use?
2nd Network Revised                                          5.


                        CHLOE
            I’m 32.

                       SYDNEY
                (noticing something)
            Wait a minute. Why do you have a
            fertility tracker on your phone?
            Ohhhhh I see. You’ve started
            menopause.

                        CHLOE
            I’m 32!!!

  Chloe takes her phone back, a little embarrassed.

                      CHLOE (CONT’D)
            I have that because...well...I’ve
            actually decided to have a baby.

  Sydney stares at her, shocked.

                        CHLOE (CONT’D)
            What?

                      SYDNEY
            Just processing. Did not see that
            coming.

                      CHLOE
            I didn’t either. But the other day
            I heard that song “Be My Baby” and,
            I don’t know, by the end of it I
            had the whole plan. Have a kid,
            dress it up like a pickle for
            Halloween, all that stuff. It just
            feels like the next step for me.

                      SYDNEY
            Okay. I get it. I support a single
            woman making this happen without a
            man. I love when anything happens
            without a man.

                      CHLOE
            Well, I thought first I would try
            this the old-fashioned way.

  Sydney bursts out laughing. Chloe reacts, a little hurt.

                      CHLOE (CONT’D)
            What’s so funny?

                      SYDNEY
            You can’t do this with a guy!
2nd Network Revised                                           6.


                         CHLOE
            Yes I can.

                      SYDNEY
            Who? You nuclear-bomb every
            relationship you’re in after six
            months. Even if the guy is great.

                      CHLOE
            You’re talking about Mark.
            Mark...had some problems.

                      SYDNEY
            Mark was a hot pediatrician who loved
            you! You broke up with him because he
            said “literally” too much.

                         CHLOE
            I did not.

                      SYDNEY
            You literally did.

                       CHLOE
                (snapping)
            It has a specific meaning it can’t
            be used as a catch-all intensifier!
                (then)
            Look, this is what I want. Love, a
            baby, all that crap. So I need you
            to be a supportive friend now.

  Sydney shrugs, then puts on a mocking rich white lady accent.

                      SYDNEY
                (messing with her)
            OMG, Chloe-kins, you’re going to be
            a mommy! Hashtag baby hashtag love
            hashtag having it all!

  Sydney grabs Chloe’s hands and jumps up and down, shrieking.

  INT. MARIA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME

  ...which transitions to the sounds of Derek and Maria
  collapsing after sex. Afterwards, they lay in bed, happy.

                      MARIA
            I can’t believe we never even made
            it to dinner. I never do this.

                      DEREK
            Oh, I could tell. You seemed really
            confused and bad at it --
2nd Network Revised                                        7.


  She hits him with a pillow. They both laugh, having fun. And
  then it gets a little quiet. Maria looks at him thoughtfully.

                      DEREK (CONT’D)
            Uh-oh, serious face. You okay?

                      MARIA
            I’m just trying to figure out
            exactly what kind of guy you are...

  Derek hesitates a moment, then jumps up, all smiles.

                      DEREK
            I am... the kind of guy who knows
            if you missed dinner, I should make
            you a snack! Kitchen this way?

  She chuckles to herself as Derek exits the bedroom.

  INT. MARIA’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

  Derek opens the fridge to grab some food. When he closes it
  we reveal MADISON (11, impish) has appeared behind the door.
  Derek, startled, drops his food.

                      DEREK
            Waah! God, you scared me. Um...who
            are you?

                      MADISON
            Madison. It’s a real pleasure to
            meet you.

  She holds out a little hand. Derek reluctantly shakes.

                      DEREK
            I’m Derek. Your mom’s...friend.

                      MADISON
                (tightening grip, intense)
            Do you want to be my daddy?

  Derek’s eyes go wide. He pulls his hand away, then flashes
  his trademarked smile... as he slowly backs out of the room.

                      DEREK
            That is... a cool question. Will
            you excuse me?

  INT. MARIA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

  Derek enters and starts gathering up his clothes. He’s
  rushing but trying to look casual.
2nd Network Revised                                        8.


                      MARIA
            You’re leaving already? I was going
            to kick you out after round two.

                      DEREK
            Oh, this was fun. But you’ve
            probably got stuff to do. And me
            too, you know? I mean, maybe if we
            both weren’t so busy...
                (re: his phone, “worried”)
            Oh boy. The emails. I should go.

                      MARIA
                (chuckling)
            Well, thanks for a nice time.
            You’re pretty good at this.

                      DEREK
                (hopeful)
            The sexy stuff, or --

                      MARIA
            No, the leaving.

  Maria laughs. Derek takes this on the chin.

                      DEREK
            Okay. Solid burn. Talk soon?

  Maria smirks, “Yeah, right.” Derek smiles and leaves.

  INT. DEREK’S HOUSE - LATER

  Derek enters his Benedict Canyon home to find his brother
  BOYD (30s, sad sack) asleep on the stairs. Derek shakes him
  gently. Boyd slowly comes to, dazed.

                      DEREK
            Boyd, what are you doing? You
            should be sleeping in a bed.

                       BOYD
            I can’t. Beds remind me too much of
            Christine.

                      DEREK
                (genuine)
            Oh, buddy. I hate seeing you like
            this. I’m carrying you to a bed --
                (fails immediately)
            Nope. I’m very weak, I’m bringing
            you a pillow.
2nd Network Revised                                         9.


                       BOYD
            Just let me go back to sleep. I was
            dreaming I was still married.
                (dreamily wistful)
            All cozy under a blanket, holding
            Christine’s hand, watching our
            favorite show about medical
            disasters.

  Derek sighs, adjusts Boyd’s blanket, heads upstairs.

  INT. DEREK’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

  Derek enters and flips on the lights. REVEAL Madison is
  sitting in the corner.

                      MADISON
            We need to talk.

                      DEREK
            Gagghh!

  Startled, Derek bumps into a lamp, which crashes to the
  floor. Madison smiles at him. Boyd rushes in.

                      BOYD
            Are you alright?

                      DEREK
            No! There’s a...tween...there.

  Boyd looks in the corner, confused. From his perspective, we
  see the chair is empty. Only Derek can see Madison.

                      DEREK (CONT’D)
            You can’t see her? She’s giving you

                      BOYD
            Why don’t you get some sleep, bud.

  Boyd shuffles off. Derek stares at Madison.

                      DEREK
            Who...who are you?

                      MADISON
            I’m your daughter. Well, the
            daughter you want to have some day.

                      DEREK
            Okay, no. This isn’t happening.

  Madison just stares at him. Derek paces, worried.

                      DEREK (CONT’D)
            I must have a concussion.

                       MADISON
            From what? Putting on too much
            moisturizer?
                (then)
            Buddy, this is happening. I’m not a
            dream, I’m not that pill you took
            at Gerard’s divorce party, and I’m
            not a brain tumor. You don’t get
            that until you’re sixty-one.

                      DEREK
            What?!

                      MADISON
            I’m kidding. I can’t see the
            future. All I know is that you want
            me. So I’m here to help you get
            your dumb little life together and
            go find my mom.

  Derek takes this in, still spinning.

                      DEREK
            I...I don’t want a daughter.

                      MADISON
            You think you don’t. But you do.
            Deep down, under that stupid shirt
            you are ten years too old for, you
            long to have more: Love. A family.
            You’re not happy.

                      DEREK
            Happy?! No adult is happy! You
            sound crazy right now!

                      MADISON
            But your life sucks: Your career’s
            a C-Plus because you only care
            about it as a pickup line. You have
            meaningless sex because you need to
            be wanted, but are scared of being
            needed. There is a good man inside
            you. But you have built a wall
            around your heart, and if we don’t
            tear it down, you are gonna die
            alone -- or worse, at the premiere
            of “Aquaman 2: The Devil’s Crab.”

  Derek is stunned silent. Madison switches gears, softening.

                      MADISON (CONT’D)
            Too harsh? I get it: Your future
            ghost child shows up and says
            you’re a loser -- it’s a lot to
            take in at once. Let’s talk about
            something else. Whatever you want!

                      DEREK
            ...Um, okay. That’d be nice.

                      MADISON
                (light and casual)
            Do you think being forced to
            testify in your parents bitter
            divorce formed a deep and lasting
            scar that --

                      DEREK
                (high-pitched)
            O-kay! I’m gonna go to bed now!

  Derek crawls under the covers, shuts off the light, and slams
  his eyes shut, denying what’s happening. A long beat.

                      MADISON
                (whispering)
            I’m still here, by the way.
                (long beat)
            Still here.

  Derek whimpers, freaked out. He puts a pillow over his head.

  INT. CARL’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

  Chloe enters. CARL (60s, overwhelmed) is doing his best to
  take care of his grandkids AUDREY, 6, GAVIN, 4, and ARTHUR,
  18 months, who he is always carrying in a Baby Bjorn. The
  house looks like a tornado hit it.

                      CHLOE
            Hey, Dad. How’s it going?

                      CARL
            Terrible! Start slicing!

  Carl tosses Chloe a cantaloupe as he tries to pour cereal
  into three bowls while avoiding Arthur, who keeps poking his
  face with a slobber-covered toy. Chloe gets to work.

                      CARL (CONT’D)
            Audrey’s late for soccer, Gavin
            hasn’t slept in...

                (checks watch)
            ...96 hours?! He should be dead!
            And Arthur ate a candle. Will he
            pass that? Chloe, can babies poop
            wax?!

  Chloe shrugs, unsure. Carl tries to jam a straw in a juice
  box. It is impossible.

                      CARL (CONT’D)
            I can’t believe your brother gets
            to go to a nice, clean office all
            day and I have to do this. I’m
            supposed to be retired. I’m
            supposed to be in an easy chair
            right now being radicalized by
            cable news!

                      CHLOE
            Well, I know he and Katie
            appreciate you being the nanny.
            You’re the best grandpa ever.

                      CARL
            Hrmph. Never have kids.

  Chloe pauses her work.

                      CHLOE
            Actually, there’s something I’ve
            been meaning to tell you. I’ve
            decided I want children.

  Carl puts down his juice box.

                        CARL
            Why? Look at me! Yesterday pee got
            shot up my nose. It’s in my brain
            now!

            I mean...how are you doing this?
            What’s the plan?

                      CHLOE
                (little tentative)
            Well, believe it or not, Sydney
            laughed when I said this, but I
            want to do it with a...you
            know...man I love with.

  Carl laughs, then looks embarrassed. Chloe is hurt.

                      CHLOE (CONT’D)

            Chlo, come on. You have so many
            good qualities. But let’s get real:
            you broke up with Mark for no
            reason. Literally no reason.

  Chloe stiffens, feeling attacked. She pivots to confidence:

                      CHLOE
            You know what? You and Sydney can
            have your doubts. But I’ll kill
            this just like I’ve killed
            everything else I’ve tried to do --
            and then stand over my doubters,
            put my heel on their face, and say
            “Suck on my family, dickweeds.”
            Sound like a plan?

  A beat.

               CARL                       CHLOE (CONT'D)
  Are you really asking, or--     -- I agree, great plan!!!

  Chloe continues chopping angrily.

  INT. BODYGASM - SAME TIME

  Derek swims laps at his fancy gym. He pulls himself out of
  the water. When he takes off his goggles, he sees Madison
  standing on the diving board. He reacts, startled.

                      MADISON
            Hello again. When your hair’s wet,
            I can tell you’re going bald.

                      DEREK
            Nope! Not talking to you! Not
            interested!

  Derek heads to the locker room. Madison watches him.

                      MADISON
            You are interested. You love me.
            Because I’m chipping at the wall
            around your heart, idiot.
                (miming tiny pickaxe)
            Chip chip chip chip chip --

  Derek ignores her. Madison falls into the pool. Derek hears
  the splash and freezes. Madison flails around in the water.

                      MADISON (CONT’D)
            I fell! Help! Help, I can’t swim!

  Derek watches her, eyes wide. She looks so helpless.
  Suddenly, instinct kicks in. He heroically dives in, swims
  over, and drags Madison out of the pool! She lies in his
  arms, lifeless. Panicking, Derek starts CPR. He has no idea
  what he’s doing.

                      DEREK
                (yelling to no one)
            Clear!

  He keeps at it, pumping her chest. Suddenly, Madison’s eyes
  open and she starts to cough.

                      DEREK (CONT’D)
            Oh my God. It’s okay, sweetie. It’s
            okay.

  Madison stops coughing and gives him a huge shit-eating grin.

                      MADISON
            “Sweetie?” Look at you! You love
            me!
                (laughing at him)
            You totally freaked out, you
            paternal little bitch.

  Derek collapses in relief. He looks down at Madison in his
  arms. And realizes something.

                      DEREK
            You’re right. Oh my god. I’m a
            little bitch.

  Madison nods, smiling. As Derek processes this epiphany...

  INT. DEREK'S GUEST HOUSE - LATER

  Derek is with Boyd, who is overcome with emotion. Boyd is
  scrolling through Derek’s phone.

                      BOYD
                (emotional)
            My big brother is looking for his
            “forever person” --

                      DEREK
            Can we not say “forever person”?

                       BOYD
                 (wistful)
            Christine hated when I said that,
            too.

                        DEREK
            Look, can you just tell me which of
            these women would make the best
            mom?
                 (then)
            Not like our mom. A nice mom. But
            still hot.

  Boyd starts flipping through profiles on Derek’s dating app.
  There are messages from a lot of young, attractive women
  partying in revealing clothes.

                      BOYD
                (carefully)
            I think these women are all very
            unique and brave in their own ways
            but I’m not getting a...
                (can’t help himself)
            ...”forever person” vibe from them.
            If this is what you’re attracting,
            maybe we should take a look at what
            you’re putting out there.

  Boyd starts flipping through the pictures in Derek’s profile.
  ANGLE ON: Picture of Derek in his EXPENSIVE CAR, Derek with a
  CELEBRITY CHEF, Derek at the GRAMMYS, Derek at the GYM...

            What do you mean? It shows I can
            drive them to a good restaurant,
            that I can get on the list at a
            fancy party, and that I'm strong
            for in bed!

  Boyd sighs, then tries again:

                      BOYD
            It seems like your priorities,
            while valid, are maybe... I don’t
            want to say superficial--

  Madison pokes her head out from behind Derek.

                      MADISON
            He's saying you look like a
            Hollywood asshole! And he’s right!
            You have driving gloves for your
            Tesla!

  Derek shoots her a look, then turns back to Boyd.

                      DEREK
            Okay, so let’s find a picture where
            I’m giving off more of a kind,
            responsible vibe.

            of champagne in a hot tub. What
            charity was for that even for?

                      DEREK

            They all basically work the same,
            It’s just a question of what your
            approach is. Bumble if you’re tired
            of pictures of guys’ junk, Tinder
            if you WANT pictures of guys’ junk,
            OKCupid if you want a threesome
            with a bored married couple,
            eHarmony if you want to meet
            someone from 2004 --

            That’s my approach. I’m going to

            throw all of the bad fish back.

            something is interesting just
            because guys like it -- is deeply

  Derek is posing with a mountain bike. He’s wearing a helmet
  and a T-shirt that has a recycling symbol on it. Boyd holds a
  camera, a little uncomfortable.

            What do you think? Responsible,
            thoughtful, cares about the Earth.

                      BOYD
            Yeah, totally. I just thought we
            would be taking pictures of...you.

            would we stand on?

                      CHLOE
            So who is this lady? She’s like a
            space DJ with hair earphones?

                      SYDNEY
            Seriously? You've never heard of
            Princess Leia? You're like the only
            person in the universe who's never
            seen Star Wars.

                      CHLOE
            Yeah, I want to watch a movie about
            how there’s zero black women in the
            whole universe. Whatever, just hand
            me the sword thing and let's get
            this over with!

  INTERCUT: EXT. VARIOUS LOS ANGELES

  We cut back and forth between Chloe and Derek taking photos
  for their revamped dating profiles:

  - Chloe poses while drinking a beer. After Sydney snaps the
  photo, she spits it out on the ground.

  - Derek holds a dog. After Boyd snaps the picture, he gives
  it to an OLD LADY, its real owner.

  - Chloe stands in front of a grill and holds up some ribs.
  After Sydney takes the picture, she tosses them in the
  garbage, then tosses the grill in the garbage.

  - Derek takes a lasagna out of a takeout container, puts it
  on a plate, and poses with a spatula, as if he’s cooked it.

  - Chloe wears a football jersey and shorts. Sydney gestures.
  Chloe rolls her eyes, then tugs down the neckline a little,
  showing a bit of cleavage.

  - Derek walks up to a KIDS BASKETBALL GAME. He puts on a hat
  that says “Coach”. Boyd snaps a picture. Derek takes off the
  hat and walks away.

  INT. DEREK'S HOUSE/INT. CHLOE'S HOUSE (INTERCUT)

  Chloe is at her house, uploading all the freshly-taken photos
  on her phone as Sydney looks on excitedly over her shoulder.
  At Derek's house, we find him doing the same thing. Chloe and
  Derek both tap “Ok” at the same time, and are immediately
  shown some potential matches... including each other!

  INT. RESTAURANT - LATER

  Derek is in a cozy booth, out on a date... With Chloe?

                      DEREK
            Let me get you a little more wine.

  ANGLE ON: CAMILLE, (cute, not Chloe) across the table. She
  nods, Derek pours some into her glass. It’s going well.

                      CAMILLE
            So, you’re a film composer? That
            sounds pretty fun and glamorous.

                      DEREK
            Oh, it’s very glamorous. Right now
            I’m working on a movie where Vin
            Diesel’s dead wife’s spirit takes
            over a boat. It’s called...Wife
            Boat.

                      CAMILLE
            That sounds...interesting.

                      DEREK
            Oh, it’s terrible. It’s the worst
            movie I’ve ever seen.

  They laugh, enjoying each other’s company.

                      CAMILLE
            Well, your profile makes it seem
            like you have plenty of interests
            outside of work.

  Derek leans in, prepared for this.

                      DEREK
            Like dogs! I know you work at an
            animal shelter, and I love talking
            about dogs. Like their breeds:
            Akita, beagle, basset hound,
            bloodhound, Belgian bloodhound--

                      CAMILLE
            Do you mind if we don’t talk about
            work? That’s not really my passion.
            I’m actually really into activism
            and local politics.

                      DEREK
                (thrown)
            Oh. Okay.

                      CAMILLE

            pictures on your profile of you
            canvassing in your neighborhood!

                (getting nervous)
            Yeah. I did that with my dog. Which
            I’m still prepared to talk about --

                      CAMILLE
            What district are you in?

                      DEREK
            Mmmmm. Seven?

                      CAMILLE
                (confused)
            Isn’t that the airport?

                      DEREK
            Not...to me it’s not.

  Camille reacts, sensing something.

                      CAMILLE
            Who are you supporting in the city
            councilor race?

                      DEREK
            Well, all of them. All of them are
            great. Them, their dogs...

            ...Glarst! Okay, I don’t know any.
            Look, I might have exaggerated a
            little. Haven’t you ever tried to
            beef up your resume?

                      CAMILLE
            What else on there is
            “exaggerated”? Did you adopt eight
            rescue dogs?

  Derek shakes his head “no”, contrite.

                      CAMILLE (CONT’D)
            Are you even thirty-one?

                      DEREK

            I’m even more!

  Camille gets up from the table and grabs her purse.

                      CAMILLE
            Do not ever call me again.

                      DEREK
            Wait, wait. Can I be honest with
            you? There’s a really good reason I
            lied on my profile.

  Camille pauses, listening.

                      DEREK (CONT’D)
            I want a baby --

                         CAMILLE
            Oh my God!

  Camille exits, quickly. She passes Madison as she leaves.

                       MADISON
                (pretending to choke)
            I’m dying... help me....
                (then)
            Oh wait, that was you choking.

  She laughs at him. Derek nods, “I’ll give you that one.”

  EXT. PLAYGROUND - SAME TIME

  Chloe is with SIMON (reasonably charming, not Derek). They
  are having a pleasant conversation as they walk through a
  playground full of KIDS.

                      SIMON
            It’s nice to meet someone who
            shares so many of my interests. I
            mean, a perfect Saturday for me is
            grilling and watching the Avengers.

                      CHLOE
                (trying her best)
            Yeah. I love the red guy.

  As they pass a park bench:

                      CHLOE (CONT’D)
            Hey, do you want to sit down right
            here?

  Simon shrugs and sits down with her.

                      SIMON
            So, you run a bridal shop, right? I
            bet you have some serious scars
            from Bridezillas.
                (charmed by himself)
            I’m also pretty funny--

  WHUMP! Simon is cut off by a soccer ball HITTING HIM IN FACE.
  Chloe winces. It clearly stings, but he does his best to
  laugh it off and be friendly, tossing it back to the kids.

                      SIMON (CONT’D)
            See, this is why I’m very against
            the rising popularity of soccer.
            Sorry, where was I. Right, the
            bridal sh--

  WHUMP! The soccer ball nails him in the face, AGAIN. He’s a
  little less breezy about it this time.

                      SIMON (CONT’D)
                (calling to the kids)
            Maybe take it over that way, huh?

  He throws the ball back a little harder this time, then takes
  a second to collect himself.

                      SIMON (CONT’D)
            Sorry. Where were --

  WHUMP! The ball nails him in the face a third time. He
  instantly explodes.

                      SIMON (CONT’D)
            Chase this into the street, you
            little bastards!

  Simon grabs the ball and gives it a mighty punt. It flies
  over the fence and bounces into the road.

                      SIMON (CONT’D)
                (calling off)
            Don’t forget to not look both ways!

            Did you see how far I kicked that?
            All the way over the... Oh.

  Chloe is staring daggers at him.

            you loved kids? Ya busted!

                (putting it together)
            Wait... is that why you asked me to
            meet you at a playground? So your
            nieces could attack me?

  Simon starts backing away, looking at Chloe like she's crazy.

                      CHLOE
            Whatever! You think I have time to
            date you for five months, just to
            find out you lied about liking

  has been watching this whole exchange.

  INT. DEREK’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT DAY

  Derek is alone, moping over the disaster that was yesterday’s
  date by playing a sad and soulful riff on his guitar. He
  pauses. Then hears Boyd SOBBING through the wall.

                      DEREK
            Sorry, Boyd! I can play something
            happier!

  Derek starts to play an acoustic version of the Six Flags
  Theme Song (The Vengaboys’ ”We Like To Party!”) on his
  guitar. Then, out of nowhere:

                      MADISON (O.C.)
            Cute.

  Derek yelps, startled. Madison takes in the sight of him.

                      MADISON (CONT’D)
            So what, one bad date and you’re
            just gonna mope forever now? I’m
            surprised you can be this sad in
            jeans that tight.

                      DEREK
            Can’t you go be a manifestation of
            someone else’s inner needs for the
            night? Maybe haunt Post Malone, get
            him to brush his teeth?

  Madison shakes her head, then plops down next to him.

                      MADISON
            What happened yesterday, dummy?

                      DEREK
            ...What happened was: she caught
            me. I’m not a guy who volunteers at
            dog shelters, or coaches little
            kids, or... reads poetry to birds.
            I don’t know why I thought I could
            get away with pretending to be a
            good person when I’m... not.

  He goes back to the guitar, down. Madison softens a little.

                      MADISON
            Maybe you’re not great. But I don’t
            think you’re the other a-hole you
            were pretending to be either.

            That guy in your old profile, who
            hides behind fancy watches and cars
            and dates mean DJs named Mackenzie,
            that guy wouldn’t have jumped into
            a pool to save me. So the question
            is: what kind of guy are you,
            really?

            Look, I grew up in basically a
            toilet fire. But despite that,

            when I’ve tried to be the guy

            loving, all of it. I even met a
            person that I thought I was gonna
            spend the rest of my life with. And
            then... it all went away. And I was
            wrecked. You think me playing the
            guitar looks pathetic? This was...
            I grew a goatee. I got a Vespa.

                      MADISON
            That’s... disgusting.

                      DEREK
            I know! I just... came apart at the
            seams. And by the time I put myself
            back together, I guess Mr. Cool-
            Doesn’t-Care-About-Anything Guy was
            who it felt safest to be.

            Stop hiding from who you really
            are, and I promise you some idiot
            out there will probably like it.

            Can you just tell me what to do
            next? Aren’t you like magic or
            something?

                      MADISON
            Again, I want to be clear: I don’t
            have any powers you might call
            “helpful”. I’m just gonna insult
            you until you’re less of a whiny,
            privileged, toxic, vapid, selfish,
            stupid, boring -- Okay, I take it
            back, this is helpful--

  Chloe is standing at her wall of index cards, busily
  adjusting them. The bell above her door JANGLES as Carl

            You’re always “fine.” You once

            I’m sorry if I didn’t say the right
            thing exactly. I think when Mom

            through it. But maybe that hardness
            isn’t helping as much as it used
            to. Because I keep going into every
            situation looking for how it’s
            gonna go south, then feeling all
            smart when it does. And I see you
            doing the same thing. You can’t
            just put your head down and get
            through this.
                (re: wall of data)
            This isn’t gonna work. You need to
            go slow, and be open to the idea of
            letting someone in. Love isn’t math
            -- it’s magic. If you can do all
            that, I know you’ll be great at it.
            Like you’re great at everything.

  Chloe takes all of this in. A beat.

                      CHLOE
            I’ll be honest: I think that was a
            good speech, but I couldn’t hear
            all of it because of how loud at
            least two of my nephews are pooping
            right now. You don’t hear that?

                      CARL
                (far-away stare)
            Baby, it’s all I hear, and all I’m
            ever gonna hear, for the rest of my
            life.

  They both laugh a little.

  INT. CHLOE - A LITTLE LATER

  While Carl tends to his kids, Sydney takes down the last of
  the “data wall” and then throws the cards away. Chloe deletes
  her profile, then starts over on a new profile.

                      CHLOE
                (re: profile)
            Is this too sappy?

                      SYDNEY
                (reading)
            “Hard workin’ gal looking for love
            and laughter... and if you turn out
            to be a dick, I will burn your
            whole life to the ground, PS I hate
            Star Wars.”
                (then, pleased)
            No that seems right.

  Chloe smiles and continues typing...

  INT. DEREK’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

  Derek joins Boyd. Boyd has procured a sack full of props.

                      BOYD
            Okay, I have a new round of
            “picture helpers” for your next
            dating profile: do you think you
            can pull off being a “part-time
            veterinarian-slash-firefighter?”

  He holds up a fireman’s helmet and a stethoscope.

                      DEREK
            Actually, I had a crazy idea: that
            I would just show who I really am?

                      BOYD
                (thrown but pleased)
            Wow! Taking it in a very different
            direction, but I’m weirdly into it!
            What kind of pictures do you want
            to put up to show the real you?

                      DEREK
            Oh. Maybe, like...

  At a loss, Derek awkwardly leans against the wall and does a
  double-thumbs-up -- then immediately wilts, embarrassed.

                       DEREK (CONT’D)
            Okay, I am a mess! Who in their
            right mind is going to wanna deal
            with this?

                      BOYD
            Don’t say that about yourself.

  Boyd puts his hand on Derek’s shoulder, steadying him.

                      BOYD (CONT’D)
            What if we start small, and take a
            picture of the truest thing I know
            about you: that you’re a really
            good brother. You’re letting me
            stay here while I get back on my
            feet, and I’m really glad you’re in
            my life. So... can we just take a
            picture of us together?

  Derek smiles, touched. They take a selfie together. It’s very
  sweet. Boyd looks at the picture... and immediately starts
  crying. Derek frowns, worried, but then –-

                      BOYD (CONT’D)
                (waving him off)
            No, it’s okay, this is the happiest
            I’ve cried in weeks!

  Derek and Boyd upload the picture, satisfied. They look at
  the grid of potential romantic matches, and then...

  INT. CHLOE - SAME TIME

  Chloe’s profile DINGS –- someone matched with her. She looks
  at who it is, but we don’t see...

  INT. BAR - THE NEXT NIGHT

  Derek is at a table. Chloe sits down opposite him. Holy shit.
  Is it finally happening?!

                      DEREK
            So, turns out I might be bad at
            dating. But I thought: instead of
            playing any games, I could just
            kind of lay out who I am -- and be
            honest about the fact that I’m
            still kind of figuring that out.

                      CHLOE
            Well, here’s what you need to know
            about me: I’ve spent a lot of time
            being a freight train, zooming
            toward my goals -- owning a
            business, making money, becoming
            best friends with Beyonce and
            saying, “Leave him, girl!”, you
            don’t need the whole list. And I’m
            never going to stop heading towards
            what I want. But it’s possible it’s
            time to stop being a freight train,
            and try being a -- what do you call
            it? -- a people train. I’m ready to
            try let someone in and have them on
            the journey with me.

  Chloe smiles. Derek smiles. And then...

  We POP WIDE to reveal: Derek and Chloe are at the same bar,
  but are seated at TWO DIFFERENT TABLES, ON DIFFERENT DATES!

  Derek is on a date with MARIA, the woman from the jewelry
  shop in Act One. Derek is smiling at her.

                       MARIA
            I didn’t think I’d see you again.
            But it’s nice that you’re looking
            for your true self. That’s
            beautiful.

                      DEREK
            Really? Thank you.

                      MARIA
            I’m a searcher, too... But then I
            found a group of people who helped
            me find me. Have I talked to you
            about Father Bryan?

                      DEREK
            ...No. Wanna keep not telling me?

                      MARIA
            It’s not a religious cult. It’s
            just called “The Rylygyn” -- like
            religion, but with all Ys?

  A WAITRESS delivers drinks. Smiling politely, Derek downs his
  entire drink in one long series of gulps as Maria continues:

                      MARIA (CONT’D)
            I’d love for you to meet them. How
            comfortable are you being naked in
            front of strangers and/or wolves?

  Derek motions, “Sorry, I’m still drinking.”    This clearly
  isn’t going any further.

  Chloe, meanwhile, is on a date with a man we’ve never seen
  before. This is MARK (perfect-looking, dorkily intense).

                      MARK
            I didn’t think I’d ever see you
            again. You never told me why you
            broke up with me.

                      CHLOE
            Well, Mark, it’s possible I didn’t
            break up with you because of you,
            but because of me.

  They smile. The chemistry is real.

                      MARK
            This is an interesting development.
            Because my friends were like,
            “There’s got to be some reason it
            didn’t work”, but I didn’t care.
            Because you leaving was literally
            the saddest thing in the world. I
            was literally dead for a week.

  Chloe listens, trying not to let it get to her.

                      CHLOE
            ...you’re saying you actually die--
                (waving it off badly)
            Not important. Not... important.

  She takes his hand. Not clear if the spell has been broken.

                      MARK
            You are literally hotter than the
            sun -- ow, you’re squeezing my hand
            really hard!

  EXT. BAR - NIGHT

  Derek exits, alone. Chloe exits behind him, hugs Mark, and
  they head in different directions. Chloe is walking behind
  Derek. Derek stops to answer a text... and then, as Chloe
  approaches... he DROPS HIS PHONE, and she SAILS PAST HIM.

  This is not the moment where they will meet...

  INT. DEREK’S HOUSE - LATER

  Derek sits on his couch with Madison. It feels normal.

                      MADISON
            So, did you screw it up again?

                      DEREK
                (kind of proud)
            Actually, this time, she did.
            Progress?

                       MADISON
            Yeah. Your special somebody is out
            there, d-bag, but it’s okay you
            didn’t meet her tonight. Look at
            you, with your children’s sneakers
            and 1/100th of a beard. You’re not
            ready yet.

                      DEREK
            I mean, no kidding: I’m talking
            about my problems with an imaginary
            baby. Who’s gonna be into that?

  Madison shrugs, “You’d be surprised...”

  INT. CHLOE’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

  Chloe finishes up a call with her Dad on speakerphone:

                       CARL
            Well, you gave it your best shot
            and now you can just see if it goes
            anywhere, right?
                (warm)
            Hey, you know what might make you
            feel great right now? If you came
            over here, we opened some ice
            cream, and you helped me change the
            sheets on a sopping wet bed --

                      CHLOE
            Thank you for the offer. But I’m
            going to just chill here by myself.
            Love you.

                      CARL
            Love you, Chlo.

  Chloe hangs up, taps some buttons on her phone and “Be My
  Baby” starts to play. She flops on the couch...and we PAN OUT
  to REVEAL: Chloe has her own little imaginary kid. The
  adorably round HUMPHREY is sitting next to her!

            Oh, good. I’m still crazy.

            I know you wish I didn’t keep
            appearing out of thin air, but do
            you want a hug anyway?

  Chloe looks at him for a long time.

                      CHLOE
            No.

                      HUMPHREY
            Does that mean you want two hugs?

                      CHLOE
            Oh my god. One hug for ten seconds.

  Humphrey slides over and hugs Chloe, quietly counting. And as
  the two of them sit listening to the song, basking in the
  warmth of a family, even if it’s not all the way real yet...

                                                  FADE OUT.
