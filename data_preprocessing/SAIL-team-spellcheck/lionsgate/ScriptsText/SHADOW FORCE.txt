EXT. NEW YORK CITY HOTEL SUITE - DAY

WIDE On a high-end high-rise hotel suite on the city’s
upper west side. Suddenly A SNIPER RIFLE rises into
FRAME. Its SCOPE assuming our field of vision.

Blurred at first, then gradually focusing and bringing A
SHADOWY FIGURE into sharp refrain.

He’s in the corner room on the 15th floor. The windows
are smoked but his silhouette is very much visible.

The cross-hair reticle alights on his form. Tracking him
tightly. Assuming his movements around the room.

The SNIPER settles their weight into a bi-pod just off
the window sill. Shouldering the stock and steadying
their aim.

A GLOVED FINGER curls around the trigger.

A HAZEL EYE is magnified through the opposing end of the
scope. It appears to be female.

THE SHADOWY FIGURE moves purposely around the suite.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The SHADOWY FIGURE, his back to us, is speaking to
someone on an encrypted cell. WE SEE a wide array of
military-grade WEAPONRY laid out, pre-action.

                       SHADOWY FIGURE
          I think I’ve found him. “Sombra” Bounty
          is still intact. 50 million for his head.


EXT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Back in the sniper’s nest, tracking the Shadowy Figure.

A finger tightens over the trigger.

WE HEAR her draw in a deep, practiced, steady inhalation,
the reticle locking over the Figure’s moving form--

                       KID’S VOICE (V.O.)
          --POW--!

--A FLASH-- the window in the distance spiders. The
SHADOWY FIGURE crumbles, disappearing from the scope.
                                                          2.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Figure lies prone. Shot dead.

                       KID’S VOICE (V.O.)
          POW! POW!

ON SCREEN WE READ:

NAME: KYLE ANSLOW
CODE NAME: “ALOKA”
STATUS: DECEASED
A PHOTO remains locked in “Aloka’s” grip: A handsome,
African-American man, receiving a commendation...Rivulets
of blood stream over his IMAGE as WE CUT TO:


INT. MODEST HOME - MORNING

KY SHIELDS, 5, runs around with his arms stretched out in
front of him and an ACTION FIGURE, gripped in each hand.

                       KID’S VOICE
          POW! POW!

He clashes the man and woman action figures together--

                       KY
          --BAM! BAM! BAM!

He runs into DAVID SHIELDS, late 30’s, his father...and
we realize right away that this is the same man we saw in
the shadowy figure’s photo.

David possesses all the outward pleasantries of a mild-
mannered, fatherly figure but we sense something
deliberately contained beneath it...something dark and
dangerous that he let go and left behind, long ago...

                       DAVID
          Whoa! Watch it Batman.

He scoops up his son with a big smile.

                       KY
          I’m not Batman, Dad! I’m Black Panther.
                 (holds female figure up)
          And this is Momma!

                       DAVID
          Momma’s fighting Black Panther?
                                                         3.


                       KY
          Black Panther tried to find Momma and she
          didn’t like that, so she’s fighting him!

                       DAVID
          What was Black Panther thinking?

                       KY
          I don’t know but Momma’s mad!

                       DAVID
          And Momma’s stronger than Black Panther.

                       KY
          She is!?

                       DAVID
          Mm-hmm. Stronger and better and faster!

Ky stares in wonder at the female action figure in his
hand as David sets him down at the kitchen table.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          So what do you want for dinner?

                       KY
          Marshmallows!

                       DAVID
          Who eats marshmallows for dinner?

                       KY
          Cool dads!

                       DAVID
                 (cackles at that response)
          Well I’m the coolest dad ever and I’ve
          never made Marshmallows for dinner. How
          about steak?

                       KY
          Then Marshmallows?

                       DAVID
          If you eat your steak.

                       KY
          Can we burn them in the fire?

                       DAVID
          Roast them in the fire, bud. Roast. Sure.
                                                         4.


Ky nods and resumes battering the action figures off of
one another while providing that rambling, impossible to
follow play-by-play only a 5 year old mind can conjure.

David then notices a bruise on the back of Ky’s neck.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          Hey, what’s that?

Ky whirls in circles with his action figures, shrieking--

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          --Ky, hey, c’mere--

--David draws Ky over to him, interrupting his play--

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          --What is that? That bruise? On the back
          on your neck?

Ky’s little face, already flushed with effort, darkens
still. His breathing slows, he casts his eyes down.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          Ky?

Ky stares at his feet for a moment.

                       KY
          Lonnie hit me.

David examines the bruise.

                       DAVID
          Did you tell your teacher?

Ky shakes his head “no”.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          Why not?

                       KY
          He said if I did, he would hit me harder.

David, his jaw tightening as he nods to himself and pulls
his son into a brief but reassuring embrace.

                       DAVID
          Ok. Why don’t you go get washed up.
          Dinner will be ready in a minute.

                       KY
                 (with a cocked eyebrow)
          One minute or one thousand minutes?
                                                          5.


David abruptly tickle-seizes his son, sending Ky into
hysterics as he squirms from his father’s grasp--

                       DAVID
                 (laughing along with Ky)
          --When it’s ready! How ‘bout it!

Ky continues to squeal with laughter as David upends him
and hangs him upside down, still tickling him.

                       KY
                 (between fits of laughter)
          Stop Daddy! I can’t breathe!

David sets Ky down, who weaves unsteadily as his father
gently ushers him off toward the bathroom.

David stews, staring off, cracking his knuckles -force of
habit- one by one...


EXT. MODEST HOME - MORNING

The type of bland, homogenized neighborhood you only see
in stock real estate photos.

A generically pleasant suburban housing tract...Every
home a cookie-cutter of the one preceding it.

David and Ky rush toward his car, a beat-up grey Pontiac
parked in the driveway.


INT. DAVID’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

David starts the car, adjusting the mirror.

                       DAVID
          What are you feeling like today, bud?

                       KY
                 (no hesitation)
          Lionel Richie! Or The Commodores!

                       DAVID
          Those are basically the same thing, son.
          How about some Curtis Mayfield or Prince--

                       KY
          --What’s a “Brick House” Dad?

David stammers, can’t think of an quick response.
                                                       6.


                       DAVID
          Uhhh, what’s that buddy?

                       KY
          A “Brick House”. They say “thirty-six,
          twenty-four, thirty six.” What’s that?

David, struggling, mightily...

                       DAVID
          ...Uh...that is...the...address! Of...The
          Brick House!

                       KY
                 (not buying it)
          Really?

David sighs, decides to level...gotta-learn-sometime-son.

                       DAVID
          Actually buddy, no, a uh, a “Brick House”
          is a term for a very beautiful, very
          curvaceous woman.

                       KY
          Oh...What’s “Curvaceous”.

                       DAVID
                 (now he’s struggling)
          Uhh. Um...
                 (aside, to himself)
          ...dammit, why did I use that word.

Then--

                       KY
          --Like boobies?

David reacts. Viola!

                       DAVID
          Exactly, son! Like boobies! There you go!

                       KY
          And booties too?

                       DAVID
          And, mm-hmm, both those things. Yes.
                 (phew, moving on)
          Ok, so can Dad pick the music today, or--

                       KY
          --Lionel Richie! Come on, Dad!
                                                         7.


                       DAVID
                 (just-go-along-with-it)
          Ok, Lionel Richie. We-love-Lionel-Richie.

David dials up his “LIONEL RICHIE” playlist and starts
thumb scrolling songs. He pauses at “TRULY”, considers
it...but something about this song gives him pause...

...and he scrolls past, punches another selection and
“SAIL ON” begins. Ky starts singing along, word-for-word.
The boy’s got some pipes and Dad is duly impressed!

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          Listen to that kid blow!


INT. GYMNASIUM - MORNING

Little boys playing basketball, which looks a lot more
like a full contact sport. It’s the 4th quarter and with
only 2 minutes left to play. It’s a blowout.

Ky checks into the game now for the first time.

David puts his hands together for his son.

                       DAVID
          Alright, Ky! Play tough now, bud!

A gym-muscled MEATHEAD DAD with frat tats, scoffs.

                       MEATHEAD DAD
          If he played tough, he wouldn’t be
          getting garbage time at the end of a
          game.

David kinks, gazing down at the man.

                       DAVID
          I’m sorry, what did you say, sir?

Meathead turns around, glaring up, flexing his forearms.

                       MEATHEAD DAD
          I think you heard every word, bro.
                 (beat, turning back)
          Your kid can’t play.

The gathered parents titter nervously against the rising
tension. Meathead exults his own son as a plus-sized kid
with a bleach-blonde faux-hawk, brings the ball up court.

                       MEATHEAD DAD (CONT’D)
          COME ON LONNIE! BREAK SOME ANKLES!
                                                          8.


David feels his blood go hot.

                       DAVID
          You’re Lonnie’s dad?

Meathead swivels back, fixes David with a Fuck You sneer.

                       MEATHEAD DAD
          Yeah?

                       DAVID
          Apple never falls that far, does it?

                       MEATHEAD DAD
          What didja say?

                       DAVID
          I think you heard every word, bro.

Meathead lunges to his feet, clambering up the bleachers
so aggressively that gasps escape more than one parent in
anticipation of something horrible about to happen.

David doesn’t budge, gazing up into this violent, vein-
bulged visage BOOMING down at him like a bull-horn--

                       MEATHEAD DAD
          --C’MON! TALK SHIT NOW, BITCH!!

David lowers his eyes-- a gesture which creates the same
immediate dread as a shark’s fin breaking the surface.

Meathead is perplexed, put off, trying to look tough but
realizing he’s wandered in too deep. David glowers up.

                       DAVID
          If your son, lays another hand on my boy,
          then you and I wi--

--Now David realizes that the game has ground to a halt
as most of the gathered crowd, as well as the kids on the
floor, are focused on this confrontation in the stands.

Meathead realizes that this lapse works in his favor,
then sees David’s gaze soften and seizes on this shift.

                       MEATHEAD DAD
          I’ll beat your ass right here.

                       DAVID
                 (his eyes on Ky)
          If you want to do this, we’ll make the
          time, trust me...just not now.
                                                          9.


Ky. Wide-eyed. Hands frozen over his mouth in confusion.

The buzzer SOUNDS now as play resumes. David rises and
clambers down the bleachers.

                       MEATHEAD DAD
                 (as David departs)
          That’s what I thought, bitch.


EXT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

Ky can feel his father’s vibrating anger as they walk
toward their car and wants only to alleviate it.

                       KY
          Are you ok, Dad?

                       DAVID
          I’m fine, bud.

Ky, this pressurized pause, his curiosity set on edge.

                       KY
          What did that man say to you?

                       DAVID
          We just had a little disagreement.

                       KY
          That was Lonnie’s dad.

                       DAVID
          Yeah, I know.

They continue walking. Ky then just randomly asks:

                       KY
          Is he an asshole too?

This snaps the tension at once. David busts out laughing--

                       DAVID
          --whoa! What is that!?

Ky grins up at his Dad like the-cat-who-ate-the-canary.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          We don’t say that word, buddy. Ever.

                       KY
          You say it when we’re driving in the car.
                                                      10.


                       DAVID
          Under my breath maybe.

                       KY
          What’s under-my-breath?

                       DAVID
          Where kids can’t hear me.

                       KY
          I can hear you. You say it to the other
          cars, too. A lot.


INT. DAVID’S HOME - BATHROOM - NIGHT

David finishes shaving, shirtless. His upper body is
criss-crossed with keloid scarring and covered with what
appears to be ancient puncture wounds, healed over ugly.

WE SEE two small EARBUD IMPLANTS on the sink basin that
David gingerly slips into each ear.

Ky sit in the bathtub, absently playing with his action
figures, his mind more on his father’s scarring...

                       KY
          Dad, how’d you get the scars? Was it the
          bad guys?

                       DAVID
          Yeah. It was the bad guys.

                       KY
          And they hurt your ears too? With
          ‘splosions?

                       DAVID
          Yup, with ‘splosions.

                       KY
          Did they hurt momma’s ears too?

                       DAVID
          No...They could never hurt your momma.

                       KY
          ‘Cuz she was better than Black Panther?

                       DAVID
          Exactly.

                       KY
          Did momma help you beat the bad guys?
                                                       11.


                         DAVID
          Yes she did.

                       KY
          Is that what she’s doing now? Beating up
          the bad guys?

David suddenly seems like a much older man in this
moment...something buried behind those eyes...a
loss...deep and indelible...

                       DAVID
          ...Yeah buddy. That’s what she’s doing.

Ky lays his little head against the side of the tub.

                         KY
          I miss her.

David sits down on the toilet opposite the tub, rubbing
his son’s head as the only measure of comfort he’s
capable of...clearly the subject of “Momma” comes up with
a frequency that both troubles and frustrates him...

                       KY (CONT’D)
          ...can you tell me the story about
          momma’s tummy?

                       DAVID
          You like that story, huh?

                         KY
          Mm-hmm.

David’s eyes glaze over as he gazes off at some
indeterminate point in his past...as this is a story that
he’s told and retold but one that he seems to still
relish telling, all the same...

                       DAVID
          ...So we know about the bad guys and the
          ‘splosions and why daddy’s ears don’t
          work, right?

                         KY
          Right.

                       DAVID
          So when momma was pregnant with you, she
          used to lay daddy down in her lap, right
          on her tummy, so I could feel you move
          but sometimes, you wouldn’t move.

Ky is perfectly still, hinged on his father’s every word.
                                                        12.


                       KY
          Why?

                       DAVID
          Because you were asleep in there, so when
          you were asleep, momma used to do this...

...and David begins tapping the side of Ky’s head,
softly, rhythmically...

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          ...and that’s how Daddy could hear your
          heartbeat and know that you were ok.

A long silence stretches as David continues to gently tap
out the cadence of a heartbeat, finally, he glances down
to find his son sound asleep.

He smiles to himself, retrieving a towel from the rack.

                                            SMASH CUT TO:

David lays wide awake with Ky passed out next to him.
Sleep is a stranger that only visits occasionally.

He gazes at the shifting, kaleidoscopic patterns of
passing car lights, strafing the ceiling above him.

He checks the time on his phone: 4:03 AM. He closes his
eyes, only to reopen them a second later...his mind a
million miles away from this moment.

He retrieves his Earbud Implants from the nightstand and
plugs them in, connecting the Bluetooth. The previous
playlist comes on...LIONEL RICHIE’S “STILL”.

David doesn’t change it...or attempt to fight off the
strange swell of emotions that follow as he hits PLAY...

                       “STILL”
          ...two people lost in a storm, where did
          we go, where'd we go? Lost, what we both
          had found, you know we let each other
          down...But then most of all, I do love
          you...still.

...the song ends and David finally closes his eyes.


INT. UNION & TRUST BANK - MORNING

David is speaking with a TELLER and going over his
statement. Ky is plopped down at his feet, playing with
his action figures. David indicates a particular charge--
                                                      13.


                       TELLER
          --that’s a disclosure fee, sir.

                       DAVID
          A “Disclosure Fee”?

                       TELLER
          It’s a small charge that the bank levies
          for teller/client interaction.

                       DAVID
          I don’t-- what does that mean? I’m not
          trying to be difficult here, Miss. I’m
          just seeing all these fees and I can’t
          make sense of them. So, the “disclosure
          fee” covers...?

                       TELLER
          Teller/Client interaction.

                       DAVID
          And what’s that?

The teller gestures, indicating David and then herself...

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          ...Wait, you mean, us...talking?

                       TELLER
                 (with a small shrug)
          It’s considered transactional sir.

                       DAVID
          Right, or as it’s commonly referred to,
          “Customer Service.”
                 (beat, shaking his head)
          Listen, if you go into McDonald’s and
          order a Big Mac.

                       TELLER
          I don’t eat meat.

                       DAVID
          Ok, whatever the plant or vegan-based
          option might be. Let’s just pretend. I’m
          the guy behind the counter and I’m
          telling you, that I’m going to have to
          charge you more for your burger, because
          you’re ordering it, from me.
                 (off her non-reaction)
          Does that make even a lick of sense to
          you, Miss--
                 (reading her name tag)
                       (MORE)
                                                         14.

                       DAVID (CONT'D)
          --Darlene. Am I missing something? Am I
          just dense? Help me out here.

Ky stands, slowly wandering away from the counter as he
spins around the lobby, playing with his action figures.

                       KY
          Pow-Pow-Pow...Bam!Bam!Bam!

WE SEE the front door open behind him and three MEN
enter, blurry and out of focus as they approach.

Ky continues backing away, engrossed in his action
figures, until he bumps into one of these MEN and wheels
around, looking up--

--and into the glowering blue eyes of A BANK ROBBER in a
ski-mask, who raises an AR-15 and FIRES a short burst
into the air--

--Ky flinches and CRIES OUT, dropping his action figures--

                       BANK ROBBER #1
          --EVERYBODY DOWN! THIS IS A ROBBERY!

This happens faster than anyone else can process.

                       BANK ROBBER #1 (CONT’D)
          KEEP YOUR HANDS WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM.
          ANYBODY MOVES GETS SHOT!

--A flash panic of pure terror as PATRONS STARTLE/SCREAM--

--David spins back as he realizes that Ky isn’t with him.

The SECURITY GUARDS raise their hands as the bank robbers
put them behind the barrels of their assault rifles.

Bank Robber #2 waves his weapon at CUSTOMERS in line,
motioning them DOWN. They cower, knitting their hands
behind their heads and lowering themselves to the floor.

David is slow to comply and even slower to kneel. He
finally SPOTS Ky across the lobby and calls out for him.

                       DAVID
          Ky!

A terrified Ky turns to find his father beckoning him.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          Come to me son!

Bank Robber #1 closes on David, training his aim on him.
                                                      15.


                       BANK ROBBER #1
          I SAID DOWN! NOW!

David implores the man, gesturing to Ky.

                       DAVID
          That’s my son there, please, just let him
          come to me.

Bank Robber #1 racks the bolt, charging the weapon.

                       BANK ROBBER #1
          YOU GOT 3 SECONDS!

                       DAVID
                 (helplessly)
          Please, please, that’s my boy--

--The Bank Robber turns to Ky and points the gun at him--

                       BANK ROBBER #1
          --That boy!? That one there!?

Ky, frozen, his tear-streaked eyes etched with a horror
that David will never forget...

...a horror that erases his own, in an instant.

Now David intones, with nothing but menace in his VOICE--

                       DAVID
          --Don’t Point That Gun At My Son.

Bank Robber #1 scoffs mockingly and begins advancing on
Ky, bringing his AR-15 up to a pre-fire chin-weld, the
barrel about to be pressed into Ky’s skull--

--Ky’s small voice is now the only thing David can hear--

                       KY
          --Dad...?

...David reaches up now and purposely removes both of his
earbuds, which submerges us in this strange aural
SOUNDSCAPE where all the surrounding clamor and chaos of
the bank ebbs away to nothing...

...he breathes in deep, his entire being seeming to
supercharge with this bristling, brutal energy.

He reopens his eyes now, locking gazes with Ky...
                                                        16.


                          DAVID
             ...close your eyes son...and cover your
             ears.

And Ky does just that, quietly, these stray tears
spilling down as he shuts his eyes tightly and brings his
hands up to cover his ears as WE SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

OVER BLACK

BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!
                         BANK ROBBER #1
             AHHHH!

CHAOS.

SCREAMS. SHRIEKS.

SHELLS CLATTER.

                          BANK ROBBER #2
             WHAT THE FU--!!

BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!
A BODY DROPS.

                          BANK ROBBER #3
             I’M GONNA KILL YOU, YOU MOTHERF--

BAM!BAM!BAM!
Then. Nothing.

Just this soft whimpering that falls away.

This odd, charged stasis takes hold...the surrounding
bank falls utterly silent as WE SLOWLY FADE UP ON:

KY. His eyes still closed. His ears still covered.

Muzzle smoke lingers, drifting through FRAME as THE
CAMERA TRACKS INTO KY as he’s hoisted up and into his
father’s arms.

                          DAVID
             Open your eyes, son.

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ERUPT
                                                       17.


Ky opens his eyes to see the shocked faces of the BANK
PATRONS and STAFF, who abruptly applaud David’s heroics--

--then he SEES blood and the wounded bank robbers, lying
strewn around the lobby. David quickly shifts his own
body to shield the scene from his son.

                       KY
          What happened?

                       DAVID
          Daddy got the bad guys.

David glances away from Ky and meets the awestruck gaze
of MEATHEAD DAD, Lonnie’s father, standing there, still
in line, slack-jawed, piss-puddled, too scared to clap.

David, dead-eyed, unblinking, encourages the gesture with
his own hands and Meathead abruptly snaps to and begins
applauding wildly, with encore-like zeal and enthusiasm.

One of the EMPLOYEES has his I-Phone out, recording.
David notices, tenses, motions for the man.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          Can I please see your phone?

The grateful employee is more than happy to oblige until
David snatches the phone away, smashing it on the floor--

                       EMPLOYEE
          --hey man! What the hell!

                       DAVID
          I’m sorry, I can’t--

--David spots the CCTV SECURITY CAMERAS now, arrayed
around the bank...and they’ve captured everything-- Dread
seizes hold as he turns and hustles Ky out of the bank--


EXT. UNION & TRUST BANK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

--and right into a gun-toting swarm of gung-ho POLICEMEN.

                       POLICE OFFICER
          --HANDS! LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS!

David makes a concerted effort to raise his hands while
trying to hold his son but he’s not moving fast enough
for the advancing, adrenalized officers--
  POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)          POLICE OFFICER #2
I SAID GET ‘EM UP!            HANDS! HANDS!
                                                         18.


Bank Patrons are now filing out of the bank to the
commotion involving David and Ky--
        BANK PATRON                  BANK PATRON #1
--STOP! He’s the one that
saved us! He stopped them!    --Put your guns down! He
                              didn’t do anything!

A loaded beat ensues, crackling with tension...

...the Officers finally relent and allow David to pass
but not before--

                       POLICE OFFICER
          --sir, if you were involved here, we’re
          going to need a statement from y--

                       DAVID
          --my five year old son was just involved
          in an armed robbery. Men were shot in
          front of him, so I need to get him to a
          Doctor and make sure everything is--

                       POLICE OFFICER
                 (pointing out ambulance)
          --we’ve got an EMT here that can check
          him out and--

                       DAVID
          --Officer, I’m getting my son out of
          here. My name is David Shields. I live at
          662 Westmont Boulevard.

                       POLICE OFFICER
          We’re going to send a unit by in a bit,
          so please make yourself available Mr.
          Shields, we’re really not supposed to let
          you leave the crime scene but...
                 (glancing at Ky)
          ...I understand, I have a son his age.
          So, we’ll review the security tapes and
          get back to you later on today.

David feels a softball-sized lump rise in his throat when
he hears mention of those security tapes. He nods curtly
and continues toward his car with Ky in tow as WE CUT TO:


INT. UNION & TRUST BANK - SECURITY ROOM - DAY

The on-scene OFFICERS huddle around a monitor...The
security footage is queued up.
                                                         19.


                       POLICE OFFICER
          This it?
                 (off their nods)
          Alright, let’s run it.

As the playback begins, WE SLOWLY ZOOM IN until we’re...


INT. UNION & TRUST BANK - DAY - FLASHBACK

...Back in the bank: Living out the robbery in real time.

                       DAVID
          Close your eyes son...and cover your
          ears.

BACK ROBBER #1’s finger curls over the trigger of that
AR-15 as Ky shuts his eyes and covers his ears.

What happens next is shocking and savage and over in
seconds.

David MOVES with tremendous speed, sliding alongside Bank
Robber #1 and smashing the AR-15 upward with the heel of
his hand which spins the rifle around--

--allowing David to seize the buttstock, jam his own
finger into the trigger guard and FIRE--

BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!
--The AR-15 is discharged right into the man’s sternum,
his body armor absorbing the barrage of bullets but
knocking him senseless all the same.

He’s blown backwards but not before David relieves him of
the 9mm GLOCK on his right hip.

                       BANK ROBBER #1
          AHHHH!

David wheels on BANK ROBBER #2, siting him down, watching
as he lifts his own weapon up and takes aim--

                       BANK ROBBER #2
          WHAT THE FU--!!

David has him dead-bang, burning the Glock’s mag full.

BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!
                                                        20.


And shredding both knees. The Bank Robber SQUEALS as he
collapses in a heap.

An astute SECURITY GUARD slides David his sidearm, a .38
snubnose revolver that skates across the floor toward him
as Bank Robber #3 stalks across the lobby, bringing his
weapon around--

                       BANK ROBBER #3
          --I’M GONNA KILL YOU, YOU MOTHERF--

David dives, grabs the .38 with his off-hand and FIRES--

BAM!BAM!BAM!
Bank Robber #3 is struck in both legs and capsizes,
crashing to the floor and clutching his legs with a
whimpering whine.

David glances back at the Security Guard and nods his
thanks. The guard grins back, bobbing his head
enthusiastically.

David turns back to Ky, still standing there, stock
still. His eyes closed. His ears covered.

David crosses over to him, lifting him aloft.

                       DAVID
          Open your eyes, son.

Ky does. The bank exults in applause as WE CUT BACK TO:


INT. UNION & TRUST BANK - SECURITY ROOM - DAY

A stunned beat as they all stare in awe at the monitor.

                          POLICE OFFICER
          Holy. Shit.

Off the room’s shared astonishment WE CUT TO:


EXT. ANTEBELLUM STYLED RESIDENCE - LAP POOL - EVENING

A MAN does exhaustive yet metronome-like laps.

Each stroke measured, precise and near-perfect as he
glides the length of the lap pool and back.

SUPER: RESTON, VIRGINIA
                                                      21.


JACK CINDER, late 50’s, seasoned beltway vet with an air
of former spook about him. A former CIA ‘Trouble-Shooter’
turned Republican appointed Secretary Of Defense.

Cinder is a master of the trade-craft and was the
Pentagon’s go-to-guy for high level blowback, risk
assessment and ‘plus level’ security threats.

He pulls himself from his final lap, his physique that of
a marathon runner as two excitable Pit bulls named
“ADAMS” & “MADISON” scuffle and skitter at his feet.

                       CINDER
          Relax gentlemen! Relax, Good Lord.

He grabs a towel and makes his way over to a table inside
an outdoor cabana, where a small cooler awaits.


INT. CABANA - CONTINUOUS

Cinder sits. The dogs compete for his attention.

                       CINDER
          ...who are my best boys!? Who are the two
          best dogs on the planet?

The Pits yip and yowl until he produces a raw steak which
instantly turns them into ramrod-stiff, still-lifes,
their finely muscled flanks quivering in anticipation.

                         CINDER (CONT’D)
          Mr. Adams?

The dog on his right extends his paw. Cinder shakes it.
He then tosses him the T-Bone. He turns to the other dog.

                         CINDER (CONT’D)
          Mr. Madison?

The other dog extends his paw. Cinder shakes it and
tosses him the steak. The two Pits tear the meat apart.

Cinder’s wife LORRAINE appears on the back patio.

                       LORRAINE CINDER
          Do those have bones in them?

                       CINDER
          How do wild dogs or wolves eat, Lorraine?
                                                      22.


                       LORRAINE CINDER
          They’re not wild dogs or wolves!
          The vet said they could get splinters in
          their mouths by eating the bones!

                       CINDER
          Is this the vet that does the
          acupuncture? The one with the crystals?
          Wears sandals with socks.

                       LORRAINE CINDER
          Stop.

                       CINDER
          She’s nuts, No. Let me handle the lads.

The dogs begin baying their approval. Cinder catches a
NEWSCAST playing on the big-screen mounted on the
Cabana’s wall. “The Cuomo Hour” on CNN. He unmutes it--

                       CHRIS CUOMO
          --as the next Iran-Contra scandal? The
          illegal sale of large stockpiles of
          American weapons to our enemies by a
          department, now under investigation by
          the Office of The Inspector General. The
          man at the center of the intrigue? IC
          veteran and former #2 at the CIA, Defense
          Secretary Jack Cinder who’s called it a
          “Liberal Conspiracy” And a “Wild goose
          chase, designed to weaken the very heart
          of our country’s covert operations”...

ON-SCREEN, a collection of Democratic REPS from the House
and Senate, buzz around a podium, delivering stern
admonishments and warnings.

                       CINDER
                 (sneering/seething)
          Cowards.

Two of Cinder’s three cellphones buzz urgent. He answers
the more impressive looking of the pair.

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          Cinder...

He listens. This long twisting frown begins to form, then
sour into a scowl...whatever news he’s receiving is
ruining his day.

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          Goddammit. I want an activation, now. And
          I mean NOW.
                                                         23.


He angrily thumbs water from the face of his wristwatch--

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
                 (listening, then)
          --No. It’ll take too long. No. Patrick--
                 (impatient, then pissed)
          --PATRICK. LISTEN! Get me an airlift.
          Crippens Helipad. 30 minutes.

Cinder clicks off. Lorraine has returned to the patio.

                       LORRAINE CINDER
          Are you watching Chris Cuomo? He doesn’t
          appear to be your biggest fan, honey.

Cinder fixes his wife with deadpan glare. She laughs, a
little innocently, a little mockingly.

                       LORRAINE CINDER (CONT’D)
                 (sing-song)
          I’m sure you’ll work it out. Y’always do.

She goes back inside. Cinder turns to his dogs.

                       CINDER
          Lads, if you see the opportunity...

...he tosses the last steak on the ground, letting the
dogs duel for it, snapping and tearing...

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          ...take her out.


EXT. PARK - BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

MARVELLA “AUNTIE” MASON and ARTHUR “UNC” BRYANT, former
special operators, still contracting for Uncle Sam.

They’re posted up in a park, on surveillance detail.

UNC, mid-40’s, plays pick-up ball with a younger crew.
He’s struggling, dragging ass up and down the court.

He’s watched with appropriate skepticism and scorn by a
AUNTIE, 30’s, who offers unsolicited coaching tips as he
hobbles by the bleachers:

                       AUNTIE
          Stay on the wing, now baby. The paint
          ain’t no place for middle-aged men!

He waves her off, winded, trailing a fleeing fast break.
                                                       24.


Auntie keeps one eye on him and the other on a pair of
sunglassed, SHADY SLEAZEBALLS, speaking with their backs
turned to one another, so it doesn’t appear as though
they’re together, or in conversation at all.

Auntie lifts a Nikon and snaps the pair on the sly, her
right ear plugged into a MINI DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONE as
she tracks and records the pair. WE PICK UP THEIR CHAT:

                       SHADY SLEAZEBALL #1
          ...which can’t come back to us. The IG’s
          office is all over our ass now--

                       SHADY SLEAZEBALL #2
          ...it’s the fucking U.S. Defense
          Department! They can shut this down? We
          got sixty crates of Stinger Missiles on
          their way to Saudi Arabia, sitting in a
          warehouse in Opa Locka--

--Auntie scribbles notes furiously, never looking down at
the notepad on the bench next to her.

ON THE COURT

Unc is gassing out fast but even doubled over, huffing
and puffing, he still calls for the ball, relentlessly.

                       UNC
          Outlet! Outlet! I’m open! ROCK!

Unc catches a cross-court pass and heaves a loooong three
from five feet beyond the arc, hitting nothing but iron.

                       TEAMMATE
          Come on, STEF HURRY! Work the ball, man!

Unc lumbers back on defense slowly, rolling out both
wrists like he still needs to warm up his stroke. He
passes Auntie again. She notes his condition.

                       AUNTIE
          TIME!

The entire court GROANS. Unc curses, limping over to her.

                       AUNTIE (CONT’D)
                 (indicating Sleazeballs)
          We’re supposed to be working...so why
          don’t you eyeball and earshot on our two
          conspirators and let mama get a run in.

                       UNC
          Why you always gotta salt my game!
                                                                    25.


                         AUNTIE
            ‘Cuz I’ve seen goddamned newborn babies
            with better ball skills! And wassup with
            the breathing!? Y’having an asthma attack
            and going into labor at the same time?

The bitching and moaning from the other players
crescendos and Unc returns to the court for the inbounds.

The YOUNG KID he’s guarding is bringing the ball up the
court. Unc bodies up, hand checking him, aggressive.

                         UNC
            Alright Young Pup! Bite Down! Wassup!?

The kid crosses Unc over not once but twice, then blows
by and rips a posterizing windmill dunk off the baseline.

Unc, still sprawled on the asphalt, is slow to get up.
The young kid shit-talks and taunts him immediately.

                         YOUNG KID
            I’mma getcha’ a good deal on a set of
            replacement ankles, Old School!

Auntie moans her disappointment as her phone chimes with
an odd ring tone. She tenses. Checks. A SECURITY PROMPT
gets her full attention. She sits up, suddenly frosty as
she enters an extended series of numbers into the prompt:

The screen reads: TRACE ECHO-- CRYPTO BURST TRANS-- SECURITY INTERCEPT--

She SEES telltale top secret data material/burst
transmissions stamped with JSOC and CIA clearances.

                             AUNTIE
            Aww shit...

--Then...the CCTV security footage from the bank plays.

                         AUNTIE (CONT’D)
                   (with a shocked rasp)
            ...David...

She goes ashen, her hand covering her mouth.

                           AUNTIE (CONT’D)
                     (looking up, yelling out)
            UNC!
                                                         26.

She watches it intently, rapt, absorbing every detail.

EXT. RURAL ROAD - DUSK

David races down the highway, ignoring the posted speed
limits as he tries to put as much distance between
himself and the incident at the bank as possi--

--WOOP WOOP--!
--A short strobe blast from a police siren, issued from
the STATE TROOPER that’s pulled in, directly behind them.

                               DAVID
             Damn.

                          KY
             What’s wrong, Dad?

Ky turns to SEE the Cruiser tailgating him. A SPOTLIGHT
blasts in hot, casting everything glare white. Another
bleat from the siren prompts David to pull over...
                                                         29.


                       DAVID
          ...Ok buddy. Listen to Dad. We’re gonna
          be calm and polite and do whatever the
          officer tells us to do. Ok?

Ky nods nervously as David adjusts the side-view mirror.


EXT. RURAL ROAD - DUSK

The TROOPER, an ancient silver moustache with mirrored
sunglasses, saunters up the shoulder toward the car.

David braces for the worst. The Trooper taps the window.
David rolls it down and without any preamble, says...

                       DAVID
          ...Officer, I am reaching into my glove
          compartment for my registration. I have
          my young son in the car with me and I am
          fully compliant wi--

--the Trooper interrupts him.

                       TROOPER
          That’s not necessary, Mr. Shields.

David turns. The Trooper grins down, extending his hand--

                       TROOPER (CONT’D)
          --My daughter-in-law Darlene works in
          that bank. You were in her line today and
          if you hadn’t done what you did, then I
          don’t know that she’d still be with us
          and I just wanted to shake your hand--

--David, dumbfounded-- what-the-fuck-is-thi--

                       TROOPER (CONT’D)
                 (seizing David’s hand)
          --and thank you...World seems to be
          running awfully short on bravery these
          days, so when a man like you comes along,
          it should remind us that we’re blessed,
          to still have men like you, come along.

David, his hand being vigorously shaken by the Trooper.

                       DAVID
          I’m-- thank, thank you Officer. I was
          just, doing what needed to be done.
                                                       30.


                       TROOPER
          And my grandbaby’s momma is still here
          because of that.

The trooper releases his vise-like grip.

                       TROOPER (CONT’D)
          Listen, the detectives would like to
          speak with you, they put out a BOLO on
          your vehicle and I just happened to be
          passing. If you could spare a few moments
          with them, they’re at your residence now--

                       DAVID
          --of course, Officer. I’m on my way home.

The Trooper pats David on the arm.

                       TROOPER
          I’ll let the detective in charge know
          that. You have a great rest of your day,
          Mr. Shields. And thank you again.

One last meaningful arm pat and then the Trooper departs.

                       KY
          The policeman really liked you, Daddy.

David nods absently as he restarts the car.

                       DAVID
          First time for everything, son.

                       KY
          What’s that mean?

                       DAVID
          That means it’ll probably never happen
          again in my lifetime...or any other black
          man’s.

Ky is too young to glean the import of this comment.

                       KY
          You’re silly, Daddy.

                       DAVID
          Yeah...
                 (re: the trouble to come)
          ...Daddy is very silly right now.
                 (beat, then)
          You ready to take a trip, bud?

Ky brightens at this suggestion.
                                                         31.


                       KY
          A trip where?

                       DAVID
          To a special house that Daddy has.

                       KY
          A special house?

                       DAVID
          In the woods. Far away from here.

The Trooper’s cruiser passes them. David waits, watching
its tail-lights fade. He turns to Ky, forces a smile.

                        DAVID (CONT’D)
          You ready?

Ky nods and David flips a quick U-Turn, speeding away.


INT. PENTAGON - NIGHT

Cinder stalks through a series of armed security
clearances, taking him deep into the working parts of the
United State’s covert intelligence community.

He removes a .380 SMITH & WESSON from his rear waistband
as he’s wanded and cleared through a metal detector.

Flanking him step for step are PARKER and PATRICK, late
20’s. Think the Winklevoss Twins but not as creepy.

Patrick hands Cinder an I-PAD with the bank footage:

                       PARKER
                 (indicating screen)
          Sombra had been inactive and off-grid for
          the past four and a half years.

                       CINDER
                 (watching footage)
          And this trio of dipshits just happened
          to be robbing a bank that he was in?

                       PATRICK
          With what appears to be his young son.

                       CINDER
                 (this is real news)
          A son? Jesus...was that it?

Cinder stops walking, his mind spinning, then, softly...
                                                      32.


                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          That was it...she got pregnant...

Patrick, oblivious to the Boss’s clear internal torment--

                       PATRICK
          --Is this “Ombra” you’re referring to,
          sir? Kyrah--

--Cinder’s anger suddenly flares red-fucking-hot--

                       CINDER
          --I KNOW HER FUCKING NAME!! AND HER
          GODDAMNED CODE NAME! I GAVE IT TO HER!

Parker and Patrick shrivel as one, taken aback by the
outburst...Cinder’s rage subsides now but only slightly--

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          --What I want to know is where she is and
          what she’s doing, right now.
                 (beat, resolved)
          And I want every single resource inside
          the IC tracking her in real time.

                       PATRICK
          She’s gone to ground, sir. There’s been
          no movement at all.

                       PARKER
                 (checking stats)
          For the past four and a half years.

                       CINDER
                 (that anger slowly returning)
          Six Shadows, her former fucking teammates
          have been killed in that same time frame.
          Did we deploy a Kick Team?

                       PATRICK
          They’ve already been there.


EXT. DAVID’S HOME - NIGHT

FIGURES move swiftly and quickly along the property line.
A FIVE PERSON TEAM in blackout camo and balaclavas take
down David’s back door with soundless precision and sweep
inside, WEAPONS UP, clearing the home, room by room.

                       PATRICK (V.O.)
          ...If they’re still together, there was
          absolutely no indication that she was
          living with them...
                                                        33.


QUICK CUTS as the TEAM collects and bags a miscellany of
items from PHONE BILLS to PHOTOGRAPHS.

They torch a small personal safe and find multiple
PASSPORTS with David’s photo in each one and various
aliases attached.

                          PARKER (V.O.)
             ...he left a small cache of passports
             behind, he might have duplicates in his
             possession but the odds he’ll try to
             travel on any of them are slim and none.

The TEAM exfils, melting back into the midnight shadows.
David’s home begins to burn behind them as WE CUT TO:


INT. DAVID’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

David slows as he makes a left turn down a rural
switchback, driving for several miles until arriving at a
remote wooded area with no access road.

He jostles a sleeping Ky in the passenger seat.

                          DAVID
             We’re here, buddy.


INT. CAR - UNKNOWN

Moving at great speed through the countryside.

WE SEE those same HAZEL EYES behind the wheel. She’s
texting someone across a encrypted DST line. The letters
immediately scramble as they’re typed out...

...UNC...NEED OPTIONS. BOY PRIMA...--

EXT. “CLUB CHAOS” -- CORAL GABLES, FLORIDA - NIGHT

Auntie and Unc angle up to the head of the huge line
formed out in front of the club. They’re waved in by the
doorman, FRITZ: 6’5, minutely muscled and slavishly
styled with a distinct, Southern Belle’s disposition.

                               AUNTIE
             Fritzie!

                          FRITZ
             Oh goodness! Look at all this gorgeous!
                                                         34.


Fritz takes Auntie’s hand, kissing it and then ghetto-
claps Unc like they’re back on the block.

                       FRITZ (CONT’D)
          So what brings ya’ll over to the Beach on
          this blustery sabbath?

Auntie pulls out a series of PHOTOS...WE RECOGNIZE the
two SHADY SLEAZEBAGS from the park.

                       AUNTIE
          Need a little background. These two like
          to club. Like to spend. Love the girls.

Fritz scrutinizes the photos, recognizes them, scoffs--

                       FRITZ
          --besides being living breathing, bipedal
          proof, that money can’t buy class, they
          try to pass themselves as amateur-hour
          “arms dealers”--

                       UNC
                 (incredulously)
          --Hold up, these two actually walk
          around, telling people they move weapons?

A group of rowdy, FRAT TYPES press up to the velvet rope
at that moment. Fritz excuses himself momentarily.

                       FRITZ
          Hold on half a tic, ya’ll.

Fritz drops the sugar-coated Scarlet O’Hara act and gets
straight HOOD. The metamorphosis is amazing--

                       FRITZ (CONT’D)
          --What THE FUCK ya’ll want!?

A TOW-HEADED SURF PUNK asks meekly--

                       PUNK
          --Are you Fritz?

                       FRITZ
          Fuck you care who I am! We related ho!?

A short, goatee’d TOAD pipes up.

                       TOAD
          We’re from Fort Lauderdale.
                                                                      35.


                          FRITZ
             FUCK FORT LAUDERDALE! Ya’ll shoulda
             stayed home! We ain’t got no room for a
             buncha sunburnt, surf’s up, pipeline
             ridin’ pussy-ass tourists!
                    (to the shortest one)
             --Yeah I’m talkin’ to you Shrinky Dink!
             You ain’t confused! Don’t trip!

Auntie and Unc smother a laugh.

                          FRITZ (CONT’D)
             Look here, this ain’t no twenty-dollar-a-
             head frat party, suckin’ on a stale keg!
             I’mma need a thousand dollars each justa
             getcha y’punk asses past the rope!

                              TOAD
             That much?

                          FRITZ
                    (to no one in particular)
             Look at this little sawed-off neckbone
             talkin’ bout--
                    (spot on imitation of Toad)
             --that much??

Fritz turns back, winking at Auntie and Unc. The frat
boys convene, a TRUST FUND type in a pink polo with a
shot collar digs out a BLACK AMEX and palms Fritz.

                          FRITZ (CONT’D)
                    (taking the AMEX)
             Oh so now we on that real shit--

--Unc’s cellphone pings, he steps away, checking it:

UNC...NEED OPTIONS. BOY PRIMARY CONCERN. PLEASE HELP.....K.
Unc enters a separate set of digits in an overlay that
erases this incoming message.

WE SEE his SCREEN pixelate and then reform as he types:

....HAVE OPTIONS...BURN CURRENT CELL...STAY OFF CIV COMMS......UNC.
He then powers down his phone, glancing over at Auntie.
She sees his expression and quickly crosses over to him,
asking cryptically--

                          AUNTIE
             --is she moving?
                                                         36.


                       UNC
          She’s moving.


EXT. WOODED AREA - NIGHT - LATER

David walks along the road, holding Ky’s hand and shining
a flashlight over a series of REFLECTIVE TREE MARKERS.

The beam finds one marker in particular. Its number has
been removed. David hands Ky the flashlight and crosses
to the tree, gripping the trunk and lifting it aloft...

...it isn’t rooted. Behind it, is a narrow dirt path.


EXT. DIRT PATH - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

David eases the car down the path, which gradually
constricts with vegetation, battering and scraping the
vehicle with passing branches.


INT. DAVID’S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

David leans across the steering wheel, peering out into
the path as it finally dead ends. He turns to Ky.

                       DAVID
          C’mon buddy, let’s go.


INT. PENTAGON - SECURED “SCIF” BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Cinder, Patrick and Parker enter. The room is comprised
of buttoned down, AGENCY/ANALYST TYPES and beige-colored,
bureaucratic CONGRESSIONAL COGS.

Cinder stops cold, spinning back to Patrick, tightly--

                       CINDER
          --why are there politicos here?

                       PATRICK
          Congressional committee reps from Armed
          Services and Homeland. The OIG
          investigation has everyone nervous.

                       CINDER
          Democrats?

                       PARKER
          Yes.
                                                       37.


                        CINDER
          Fuuuuck.

Cinder turns back to the room, Parker begins making
introductions which Cinder immediately short-circuits--

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          --let’s not waste time. It’s late. The
          people in this room have been “read in”,
          so here it is, short, sweet and
          unredacted: Eight years ago we recruited
          a group of elite special operators for a
          unit called “Shadow Force”:
          A clandestine kill-team tasked with
          handling hot spot, high-level
          terminations, dictators, tyrants...doing
          God’s dirty work around the globe. Each
          member had a codename, “Kivuli” “Varjo”
          “Anino” “Aloka”-- all different language
          derivatives of the word “shadow” There
          were--

--Cinder points back at Parker, cueing him--

                        PARKER
          --Thirteen.

                       CINDER
          Thirteen, wildly successful members of
          this unit and then, internal strife tore
          them apart and the unit disbanded to the
          tune of 362 million tax-payer dollars in
          developmental and deployment costs.

                       BUREAUCRAT #1
          And how does this David Shiel--

                       CINDER
          --that brief dramatic pause was neither
          the end of my speech, nor designed to
          signal follow-up questions from you. As I
          tell my two dogs: “listening is a skill”

The Bureaucrat, chastened, clams up. Cinder inhales,
gathers himself, appears to collect his thoughts and
then...blank--

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          --now I can’t remember what I was going
          to say...Goddammit.

Patrick and Parker, ever vigilant and at-the-ready.
                                                      38.


          PATRICK                        PARKER
...the unit disbanded...?     ...the loss of hundreds of
                              millions...?

Cinder, pissed this narrative thread is now eluding him--

                       CINDER
          --No, no, I said that, that was...
                 (shaking his head)
          ...shit...lost my train of thought.

A stagnate beat. The room uncertain as to how to react.

                       PARKER
                 (gently offering)
          The reason the unit broke up?

Cinder. Eureka!

                       CINDER
          Ahh, yes-- David Shields, the man in the
          bank video and, Kyrah Owens...

Cinder utters “Kyrah Owens” like he just took a big bite
of something rotten that he can’t spit out.

IMAGES of David and Kyrah begin cycling past on a large
VIDEO SCREEN directly behind him.

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          ...these two meet as Shadow Force Co-
          Commanders, romantic entanglements being,
          strictly forbidden, a May-December thing
          blossoms in spite of, which results in
          aforementioned “internal strife” and they
          abandon both the unit and their command.
                 (more than a kink of emotion)
          I now believe the woman “Ombra” may have
          been with child at the time which
          would’ve hastened their flight--

--Cinder pauses as he fends off some internal turmoil.
It’s as if the mere mention of Kyrah’s pregnancy damaged
some deeper part of him...this is one of the more smugly
chipper CONGRESSIONAL COGS asks:

                       CONGRESSIONAL COG
          Secretary, can we ask what operational
          measures you’re implementing?

Cinder, never in a mood to mince words.

                       CINDER
          This is a search and destroy.
                                                         39.


The bluntness of this edict seems to unsettle the Cog.

                         CINDER (CONT’D)
            The recruitment for Shadow Force came
            with a single iron clad rule: No one
            leaves. You die or you retire out.
            Violation of this rule put a 25 million
            dollar bounty on that individual, to be
            collected by their fellow teammates.

An ANALYST chimes in.

                         ANALYST
            How many members remain in Shadow Force?

                         CINDER
            One was killed in New York last week.

Cinder jabs a finger at Parker, who’s initially confused--

                        PATRICK
            --sir?

                        CINDER
            The name?
            PATRICK                    CINDER (CONT'D)
Code or--                        --Code--!

                         PARKER
                   (to the rescue)
            --Hooskii, which is Somalian for Shado--

--Cinder jabs that same finger back at Parker with twice
the force, halting him mid-sentence--

                         CINDER
                   (back to the room)
            --So, this operator’s demise leaves only
            five members in the hunt.

                         ANALYST
            And these remaining members are now
            tactically engaged?

                         CINDER
            There’s been an “Activation” yes.
                   (pointing back at screen)
            And the price on their combined heads, is
            50 million USD, tax free.

Cinder can feel the temperature in the room rising. The
second-guessing and armchair quarterbacking, imminent...
                                                      40.


                       CONGRESSIONAL COG
          Secretary, with respect, your department
          is the subject of a fairly broad and far-
          reaching OIG investigation at the moment.
          Any illegalities that this “manhunt”
          might trigger could land you in even
          hotter water with the Inspector General.

                       BUREAUCRAT #1
          You could face federal subpoenas,
          impeachment and the possibility of jail.

                       ANALYST
          And there are rumors that moles and
          whistle-blowers may be operating within
          the State Department that could furth--

                       CINDER
                 (agitated, out-of-patience)
          --these are the risks that I run. I’m
          sure some of you would suggest that we
          simply let these sleeping dogs lie but I
          would submit that these same dogs will
          eventually wake up and shit all over our
          rug...These are outlaw, lethally trained,
          highly-skilled operators privy to years
          of our most sensitive secrets. Secrets
          that can be reborn, as blackmail.
                 (beat, toward the cogs)
          I know these meetings are part of some
          congressional “transparency program” but
          what we do on the covert side is cloudy
          and opaque and what we accomplish is
          real...Keeping this country safe.
                 (beat, this thin smile)
          And I can’t think of a better line to
          walk out of a room on...

...And with that, Cinder exits.

Patrick and Parker trade a quick, almost conspiratorial
glance and then follow him out.


INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

Their path lit by the flashlight function on David’s
I-Phone. He keeps Ky close as they maneuver along, wading
through brackish water.
                                                         41.


INT. SAFE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

A false floorboard pops open. David’s head pokes through,
the flashlight follows, moving around the darkened room.

                       DAVID
                 (glancing down)
          Ky, stay right there, give Dad a second.

                       KY (O.S.)
          Ok.

David pulls himself the rest of the way up, rolling onto
his feet and quickly crossing to a credenza against the
wall, near the entrance. He feels along the lip, presses
a release button. The lid rises automatically...

...WEAPONS are secured to its underside. He removes a
RHINO 200DS .357 from its housing and tucks it into his
waistband, quickly closing the credenza’s lid.

David flips the lights on now, illuminating the room.

                       DAVID
                 (calling down)
          Alright bud, come on up.

Ky’s head appears a moment later, gazing around. David
hoists him up.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          What if I told you, you didn’t have to go
          to school for awhile?

                       KY
                 (genuinely excited)
          I don’t have to go to school!?

                       DAVID
          Ok, let’s not get too fired up, this
          isn’t forever, it’s just temporary.

Ky leaps around anyway, exulting, elated. David smiles
weary, half his attention here, the other half mindful of
what might be moving around them...and closing in.


INT. SAFE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Father and son devour bowls of Ramen at the table.

                       DAVID
          How is it?
                                                      42.


Ky is eating so ravenously, he’s only able to nod.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          Dad is usually a disaster in the kitchen
          but he can cook the hell outta some ramen
          noodles, can’t he?

Ky swallows, setting his fork down...

                        KY
          ...Dad?

                        DAVID
          Yeah, bud?

A beat.

                       KY
          Why did you take your ear plugs out?

                       DAVID
          What do you mean? When?

                       KY
          In the bank, with the bad guys. You took
          them out.

David nods, chewing, formulating an appropriate reply...

                       DAVID
          ...Y’know Daredevil? How he’s blind?

                        KY
          Yeah.

                       DAVID
          But he’s still a super-hero because his
          super-power is, he can hear everything.

                        KY
          Yeah.

                       DAVID
          Well, Daddy’s is like that but it’s when
          I can’t hear. That’s my super-power.

                        KY
                  (genuinely curious)
          How?

                       DAVID
          I don’t know. I just get really focused.
          Everything slows down. I feel strong.
                                                        43.


                       KY
          Is that why you got the bad guys?

                       DAVID
          Mm-hmm. I think so.

Ky nods, nibbles nervously on his lower lip, reluctant to
ask this next question...Then:

                       KY
          You were never a bad guy, were you Dad?

David stops eating...he can SEE this growing anxiety in
his son and wants only to alleviate it, immediately.

                       DAVID
          ...Y’know, a long time ago...I was.

Ky absorbs this. His little eyes beginning to mist.

                       KY
          ...Was momma too?

David nods solemnly.

                       KY (CONT’D)
          Why?

David, his mind being implacably pulled back into the
murk and madness of his past...

                       DAVID
          ...We thought we were the good guys.

Ky gazes unblinkingly at his father. Expectant. Hopeful.

                       KY
          Are you now?
                 (his voice warbling/cracking)
          The good guys?

David reaches out and rubs his son’s head reassuringly...

                       DAVID
          ...Absolutely.


INT. SAFE HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

David showers, head hung. The weight of what he’s feeling
isn’t something that hot water has ever washed away.
                                                         44.


INT. SAFE HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

David climbs into bed next to a sleeping Ky, kissing him
on the forehead, listening to him breathe. David closes
his eyes, trying to drift off to that dulcet rhythm...

...it doesn’t work.

He flips on the older console TV atop of the dresser and
SEES HIMSELF in CCTV FOOTAGE from the bank, accompanied
by a blow-dried talking head’s NEWSCASTER narration.

The video has been blurred to obscure the violence.

                        NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
           ...as authorities continue their search
           for “local hero” David Shields. The
           Woodbine man who single-handedly foiled a
           mid-morning bank robbery at First Federal
           in Regent Hill earlier today. Mr. Shields
           left after the incident with his young
           son in tow and their whereabouts are
           currently unknown...

The video shifts to an interview with a local SHERIFF.

                        SHERIFF
           We just want to question him, he’s in no
           trouble, it’s pretty clear from the bank
           footage that he did a really heroic thing
           that potentially prevented a real loss of
           life...

David clicks off, settling back into bed, his thoughts
spooling wildly...keeping him hard-wired and wide awake.


INT. SAFE HOUSE - BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN

--CREAK.

David cracks an eye open.

CREAK-- it sounds like someone is in the house.

He glances over at Ky, who stirs, still asleep.

He removes the Rhino Snubnose from the nightstand and
carefully climbs out of bed.


INT. SAFE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

David moves with a gun like he was born holding one.
                                                        45.


Precise, practiced, movements, mastered over years of
combat and engagement.

He sweeps room to room, pure stealth, pistol leading.

He reaches the living room and flips the lights on.

Nothing.

He walks over to the floorboard, it’s been moved--

--Suddenly the pistol is kicked out of his hand from
behind.

He turns and gets cracked in the face by a masked
intruder with HAZEL EYES.

She attacks with a steady combo of blows to the head and
body, each punch with pop and purpose and vicious intent.

David, on his back foot, trying to defend himself, is
caught completely off guard this aggression.

He’s able to block and parry while getting his bearings,
but is being steadily backed across the living room as he
attempts to weather and withstand this assault.

These barrages are thrown with a fury and anger that
seems intensely personal.

Now David launches his counter-attack and they really go
at it, both of them equally skilled and evenly matched: A
full on, expertly fought brawl between two combatants
that seem to mirror and mimic one another’s movements--

--then Hazel Eyes lands a spinning round house kick and
follows it up by sweeping David’s legs and taking his
balance, putting him flat on his back.

Hazel Eyes mounts him, ripping her mask off...and WE
RECOGNIZE this woman immediately as KYRAH OWENS.

                        KYRAH
           How could you put him in danger?!

David stares up at her, this look of regret and sadness,
until he moves, whiplash fast, executing a maneuver that
reverses their positions and puts him on top of her.

                        DAVID
           Where the hell have you been?

Kyrah bridges upward, wraps her leg around David’s neck
and then rolls him over, going for an arm-bar submission.
                                                        46.


                       KYRAH
          Watching your back!

David shifts, postures up and then lifts her aloft with
him like he’s going to power-bomb her into the floor.

                       DAVID
          Then what the fuck are we doing here!?

She immediately releases her hold and bounces back to her
feet, her hands raised in a traditional guard, her front
leg slightly aloft as she advances in a Muay-Thai stance.

They’re both ready to launch into one another anew when
they notice--

--KY. Standing there. Slack-jawed. Staring at both of
them, his action figures frozen in either hand.

The sight of her son immediately cancels whatever anger
and aggression she’s feeling. Tears slowly fills her eyes
as she crosses over to Ky and kneels down.

Mother and son regard one another for a sustained moment.

Ky looks at Kyrah for a long time, this small smile
forming as he utters the following, whisper-quiet...

                       KY
          ...I like your face. It’s pretty.

Kyrah smiles, releasing tears. She reaches out and
touches her son’s cheek now, softly stroking it.

                       KYRAH
          I like yours too. It’s handsome.

                       KY
          Why did you fight my dad?

Kyrah shoots a side-eye at David, then returns her gaze
to Ky, placing her hands on his shoulders and squeezing,
looking nervous and unsettled, her voice warbling...

                       KYRAH
          ...do you know who I am, honey?

Ky searches her face, his gaze playing over her features
carefully, processing something-- then his gaze abruptly
shifts down to the female ACTION FIGURE he’s holding in
his hand, before returning at Kyrah...

...who looks exactly like the action figure.
                                                         47.


This gasping, gobsmacked realization comes over Ky and
those little eyes beam back at her now, spellbound...

...then he touches her face and says in a voice that
reminds Kyrah that there is indeed a God...

                         KY
          ...Momma?

She nods. Tears fall. Ky, marveling at the sight of
“momma”, collapses into her all at once, his little frame
melting into her as he begins to buck and sob...

                       KYRAH
          ...Don’t cry baby, it’s ok.
                 (reassuring, soothing)
          I’m here...Momma’s here.

David watches this reunion with a mix of melancholy and
relief as he begins returning the living room to normal,
righting overturned furniture and re-hanging frames...


INT. SAFE HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

David tucks Ky back into bed. He smiles, whispering up to
his father excitedly...

                       KY
          ...Momma’s here.

                         DAVID
          She is, bud.

                       KY
          Is she gonna be here when I wake up?

                       DAVID
          Yes. I promise. Now go to sleep. Momma
          and I have a lot to talk about.

David kisses him on the forehead as rises to leave. As
Ky’s eyes close shut WE MATCH CUT TO:


INT. MODEST HOME - BEDROOM - FLASHBACK

BABY KY, sleeping in a crib.

SUPERIMPOSE: 4 YEARS AGO

OFF-SCREEN, WE HEAR arguing coming from another room.
                                                      48.


INT. MODEST HOME - FLASHBACK

David paces. An annoyed Kyrah stares at him.

                       KYRAH
          Go back!?

                       DAVID
          We made a mistake.

                       KYRAH
          David, we went AWOL from a Special
          Missions Unit. A unit we were commanding.
          There’s a 50 million dollar bounty on us!
          Our teammates are coming to collect.

                       DAVID
          We reach out to Cinder, we tell him we
          made a mistake, you got pregnant, none of
          this was planned--

                       KYRAH
          --We’re not doing that! We can’t do that!

                       DAVID
          Why not!? What the hell is it?

                       KYRAH
          David, our unit was shut down! Do you
          know how many hundreds of millions in
          defense spending was either frozen or
          stripped from Cinder, after we fled?
          Shadow Force went dark, because of US.
                 (beat, understand this)
          And that doesn’t get forgiven, ever!

                       DAVID
          Kyrah. You wanted to run. I loved you. I
          wanted to run with you but you’re scared
          and you’ve been scared and you’re not
          telling me why!

Kyrah plops down in a chair with this long pained sigh...

                       KYRAH
          ...Cinder recruited me, personally.

David nods, nervous now, not sure where this is going...

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          ...we had a, moment together. A long time
          ago, when I was with DevGru, before I
          ever laid eyes on you, baby.
                       (MORE)
                                                      49.

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          He said he was separated from his wife, I
          found out that he was lying and I broke
          it off.

David stops pacing, looks positively gut-punched...

                       DAVID
          ...why did you never mention this to me,
          Kyrah?

                       KYRAH
          Because I didn’t want to see the look on
          your face that I’m seeing right now.
                 (beat, the gravity of it)
          Even after you and I got together, he
          never stopped pursuing me.
                 (beat, grim)
          And I don’t think he’ll stop now.

David’s eyes slam shut. His voice a sharp rasp.

                        DAVID
          The baby.

                        KYRAH
          I know.

                       DAVID
          You should have told me.

                        KYRAH
          I just did.

                       DAVID
          So you had an affair with the second-in-
          command at the CIA--

                       KYRAH
          --if you’re going to turn this into some
          jealous boyfriend bullshit then I’m gonna
          walk out of this room, right now.
                 (beat, reminding him)
          What did we decide? That Shadow Force was
          being politicized. That there was no room
          for us anymore. That Cinder was turning
          it into a private army. You have to trust
          me now David, there is no going back.

                       DAVID
          Then we need real operational strategy or
          we’re gonna spend the rest of our lives,
          looking over both shoulders.
                                            50.


               KYRAH
We split up.

               DAVID
Split up?

             KYRAH
Not in that way. I mean physically.
They’ll be looking for us, for you and I.
       (beat, her gaze dropping)
What they won’t be looking for, is a
single father, raising his son.

             DAVID
What are you talking about?

             KYRAH
Our boy. And keeping him safe no matter
what. The two of us together are a huge
target right now.

             DAVID
So what are you proposing?

             KYRAH
Time. Time to draw out the threats and
deal with them. We can live off our
savings and set up our future and when
it’s safe, we disappear, together.
       (beat, hoping this lands)
As a family.

               DAVID
When?

             KYRAH
I don’t know. A few years.

               DAVID
Years?

             KYRAH
       (irritated now)
How long would you keep looking for 50
million dollars, David!?

             DAVID
So you want to face them down alone?
Shadow Force?

             KYRAH
I trained ‘em, I know their tendencies,
their tricks.
                                                          51.


                          DAVID
             And why you--?

                           KYRAH
                    (sudden, final)
             --Because I’m his mother...which means
             there’s nothing on the planet that can
             protect him better than me.
                    (beat)
             Not even you.

                                                      BACK TO:


INT. SAFE HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

David and Kyrah sit across the table from one another.
Dead silent. Disengaged. The obvious emotional distance
between them seems impossible to bridge at the moment.

Finally...

                          DAVID
             ...Where have you been, Kyrah?

                          KYRAH
             Where do you think?

                          DAVID
             I don’t know what to think, beyond the
             thought that we got ghosted.
                    (anger/remorse)
             What happened to our plan? Our happily
             ever after?

Kyrah, this flash of real regret in her eyes...

                          KYRAH
             ...you have no idea, what I’ve been
             doing, to keep this family safe.

                          DAVID
             Family?
                    (beat, leaning toward her)
             Is that what we are all of the sudden?

She brings her gaze up on him like a weapon, glowering.
He demurs, not wanting to make this situation any worse.

                          DAVID (CONT’D)
             Who’s left? The Shadows.
                                                       52.


                       KYRAH
          I got Hooskii last week. He was closing
          in on you. He had photos and a work-up.
                 (beat, with some despair)
          Five Shadows are still active. The worst
          of us...the ones I’m most worried about.

                       DAVID
          Let me guess...Cysgod. Moriti. Anino.
          Scath. Varjo.

Kyrah squeezes her temples, nodding.

                       KYRAH
          Yeah.

INSERT: QUICK FLASHES of HUNTING KNIFE, RED NAILS,
GLASSES, ATTIC WEAPONS, HULKING MAN.

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          Plus whatever systems support they have.

                       DAVID
          Meaning every last fucking molecule of
          JSOC now that Cinder is running Defense.

                       KYRAH
          He triggered the activation.

                       DAVID
                 (with attendant worry)
          Then he knows about Ky.

A fear and foreboding floods Kyrah’s eyes as Ky appears,
wandering into the living room, rubbing off the sleep. He
stumbles toward his mother and capsizes into her...

...he’s snoring a half-second later, still standing.
After a moment...

                       KYRAH
          ...is he asleep?

David smirks/scoffs with more than a tinge of envy.

                       DAVID
          No idea how he got that comfortable with
          you, that fast.

Kyrah redirects David’s little dig.

                       KYRAH
          Maybe he finally feels safe.
                                                      53.


David death-stares her for that remark but she’s focused
on Ky’s face, her hand brushing over its small contours.

                       DAVID
          I want to get him somewhere offline and
          away from us for now.

                       KYRAH
          Absolutely not. I’m not letting him out
          of my sight.

                       DAVID
          Kyrah. They are coming for us and it’s
          ON...and whether we want this fight or
          not, it’s gonna fucking find us.
                 (beat, pointing to Ky)
          But it cannot find him...You’ve been the
          hunter. We’ve been the hunted. Hiding.
          Hoping. Living in fear.
                 (beat, resolved)
          So we’re gonna get our son locked down.

                       KYRAH
                 (a beat, then)
          Auntie and Unc. They’re working for the
          IG, down in Florida, investigating
          illicit arms deals that may lead back to
          Cinder.

                       DAVID
                 (the magnitude of it)
          Jesus. And they’ve been helping you move?

                       KYRAH
          I’ve been bouncing data bursts between
          the both of ‘em, so there’s no redundant
          comms.

David gets suspicious.

                       DAVID
          They ran tactics and logistics for Shadow
          Force, Kyrah--

                       KYRAH
          --and what does that matter?

                       DAVID
          Because they were tight with Cinder.

                       KYRAH
          Then...Now, they’re investigating him.
                                                        54.


                       DAVID
          And they had every reason to hate our
          guts for quitting that unit--

                       KYRAH
          --And, they’ve been nothing but rock
          solid for me since we went rogue.

                       DAVID
          Then we get Ky, tucked in with those
          those two and then mommy and daddy go
          fuck some shit up.

                       KYRAH
          What do you mean?

                       DAVID
          Cinder. He’s the head of the snake.

                       KYRAH
          And the most powerful man in Special
          Operations--

                       DAVID
          --Which makes him, the-man-most-likely-to-
          hunt-us-till-the-ends-of-the-earth.

                       KYRAH
          Why don’t we just gun for Godzilla
          instead? Or go into Hell after Hitler.

                       DAVID
          We can get him, you and me. Together.

Kyrah studies David now...with more than a measure of
skepticism in her eyes.

                       KYRAH
          And this isn’t, in any way, personal for
          you--?

                       DAVID
          --Not personal. Tactical. Everything,
          including The Shadows, falls apart
          without him...So he’s the one that needs
          to get “got”.
                 (a deliberate dig on her)
          Unless you don’t think you can do
          it...because of, your past with him an--

--Kyrah cuts him off with a look, a warning in her eyes--

                       KYRAH
          --Don’t.
                                                         55.


David de-escalates, realizes his error, goes quiet. Kyrah
returns her attention to their slumbering son, sighing.

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
                 (the weight of it all)
          So we’re supposed to go to assassinate,
          the sitting Secretary Of Defense.

                       DAVID
          What’s wrong with that?
                 (allowing for the absurd)
          Besides the obvious.

                       KYRAH
          Well, that’s a lot of what’s wrong.
          That’s most of it.

                       DAVID
          What’s the rest?

She stares over up at him. Blunt. No bullshit.

                       KYRAH
          You’re not up to it. Any of it.

A charged beat. David’s gaze tightens on her.

                       DAVID
          What are you talking about?

                       KYRAH
          You’re not sharp. You’ve lost a step.

                       DAVID
          Well, three assholes that recently robbed
          a bank, might beg to differ.

                       KYRAH
          Three civilians who bought their gear at
          gun-shows and shot paper.

Now it’s David’s turn to be offended.

                       DAVID
          I’ll handle mine, you handle yours.

And with that David stands and stalks out of the room.

Kyrah lingers a moment longer, watching Ky sleep...then,
listening for his pulse, she begins gently rapping out
its rhythm on his cheek...

...beat-beat...beat-beat...beat-beat...
                                                         56.


INT. FOUNDRY - SOMEWHERE IN THE BELTWAY - DAY

WE FOLLOW CINDER, PARKER and PATRICK through a massive,
abandoned foundry with derelict structures covering
several square miles...

...the perfect place to hide from the world and plot.

Arrayed around an ad hoc staging center, chatting with
one another...are all five remaining SHADOWS: CYSGOD.
MORITI. ANINO. SCATH. VARJO.

Three men. Two women...and perhaps the most poised and
polished, professional assassins ever assembled.

Each of them carries the barb and cold blood of their
calling and each of them wield the unmistakable and
distinct mien of former Spec Ops:

Expert soldiers in every measurable way.

Orbiting the perimeter are a motley mix of MERCS and
SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE: Two dozen or so guns-for-hire.

Cinder arrives, greeting each of his former team with a
curt nod and bringing their impromptu reunion to a halt.

                       CINDER
          You’re all familiar with one another and
          we all share deep history so I’ll skip
          the lecture on ‘Do’s & ‘Don’ts’ and get
          right to my list of demands. One: Don’t
          bitch about money because I’m doubling
          the bounty.

The Shadows audibly and effusively react to this news.

                        CINDER (CONT’D)
          100 million five ways, is a huge payout
          and exclusive to this Op. Two: We don’t
          do advances, loans or the like. Payment
          is due, in full, after-action. Three: We
          plan and execute with precision. We don’t
          play odds. We don’t rely on luck.
                 (beat)
          Not with these two.


INT. SAFE HOUSE - BASEMENT - MORNING

Kyrah and David stand in front of a makeshift gun-range
built in the cellar of the Safe House with traditional
circular targets and human silhouettes at either end.
                                                         57.


Kyrah un-holsters her pistol, offering it to David.

                       KYRAH
          Your cold shot, let’s see it.

David stares at her gun.

                       DAVID
          You gonna let me zero it out to my specs?

Kyrah withdraws her pistol and re-holsters it as David
snaps into action, pulling his own weapon and FIRING a
“double tap” downrange.

ANGLE ON TARGET: TWO HOLES...spaced less than half an
inch apart. David smiles at the result.

Kyrah grins, mock-approvingly.

                       KYRAH
          That’s really something, wow, you--

--she then snap draws her own sidearm and BLAM-BLAM--

--puts two holes right next to his, these two holes, her
“Cold Shot”, overlap and appear as one.

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          I was always a better shot than y--

                       DAVID
          --you were not, always a better shot than
          me, plus you’ve been operational.

                       KYRAH
          --shouldn’t we both be operational? When
          you’re the primary protector of our son?

                       DAVID
          It’s called “parenting” Kyrah...and it
          doesn’t allow for a lot of trigger time.

Kyrah takes this slight in stride, replies with her own.

                       KYRAH
          You gotta clean your targeting up. It’s
          consumer grade. Remember Odessa?

                       DAVID
          Oh here we go. Ancient history. Again.

Kyrah yanks down her right sleeve at the shoulder,
revealing a keloid scar, in the shape of a bullet wound.
                                                      58.


                       KYRAH
          You shot me in the shoulder!

                        DAVID
          And distracted the asshole holding you at
          gunpoint, which allowed me, to kill him.
                 (beat)
          He was moving and shifting behind you,
          the only thing I could get a bead on,
          with any degree of accuracy--

                       KYRAH
                 (recovering the scar)
          --was my shoulder?

                       DAVID
          Was. Your. Shoulder.
                 (beat, beside himself)
          I mean woman, can you hold onto some
          shit, or can you hold onto some shit!?

Kyrah exits in a huff, giving David her back.

                       KYRAH
          I’m gonna grab Ky. We need to get moving.
                 (as he climbs the stairs)
          Remember to reload.

David flips her off, slapping a fresh mag into his gun.
He then turns and sends two more rounds down range.

BLAM! BLAM!
This double tap nearly touches. David shrugs, satisfied.

                       DAVID
          See? That didn’t take long.


INT. FOUNDRY - DAY

Cinder leads The Shadows into a staging area, indicating
the tables that are carefully arrayed with the highest
military grade of weapons, explosives, ammunition, etc.

                        CINDER
          I’m sure you prefer your own loadout but
          we “stocked the fridge” just in case.
                 (beat)
          You may encounter civilians, including a
          child. If you have to eliminate them, do
          so, but if they can be preserved, that
          would be my, “operational preference”.
                                                         59.


Parker and Patrick appear unsettled by this statement.

                       ANINO
          Including Ombra and Sombra?

                       CINDER
          The opportunity to put a bullet in each
          of their heads is one that I’m savoring
          at the moment...Especially hers.
          Remember, our two little defectors are
          carrying a tidy little shit ton of money
          between them...we have actionable, real-
          time intel on their whereabouts and we’re
          locking in their location now...so, game
          on boys and girls...go get ‘em.

The remaining Shadows begin prepping for the Op. Cinder
turns to Parker and Patrick.

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          You two are overseeing this for me.
                 (beat, a grim warning)
          Don’t fuck it up.

They nod their nervous acknowledgement. Cinder breaks
away, briskly. They follow him at a respectable distance,
Patrick retrieving his cellphone and checking something.

He looks over at Parker, who consults his phone as well.


EXT. WOODS - DUSK

Kyrah tears the tarp off one of the last of the Muscle
Car’s eras true masterpieces: A 1987 BUICK GRAND NATIONAL
(GNX). This thing is no bullshit, all business and
murdered out in matte black.

                       KY
          Wow, momma! Is this your car!?

                       KYRAH
          This is momma’s whip, baby! You like it?

                       KY
          It’s soooooo cooooool!

Ky “oohs” and “ahhs” it as he circles the vehicle.

                       DAVID
          Do Auntie and Unc know we’re coming?
                                                      60.


Kyrah nods, popping the trunk and pulling out a stack of
LICENSE PLATES. She removes the one attached and replaces
it with an ARIZONA PLATE which magnetically affixes.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          How clean is this thing?

                       KYRAH
          I run anti-RF, short-wave and sat-com
          scans, before the key ever touches the
          ignition. Then separate scans for U-V,
          FLIR, Thermal and millimeter-wave radar.

                       DAVID
          What are you carrying?

                       KYRAH
          All custom. Quarter-inch, inlaid titanium
          carbon-fiber up-armoring. V-12 short
          stroke switchout engine. Reinforced
          bumpers so it can punch through
          roadblocks. Run flat tires. UL Level 10
          Bullet-resistant glass.

Kyrah slams the trunk. David grins.

                         DAVID
          I’m driving.

Kyrah smiles at Ky as he wraps his arms around her waist.

                         KYRAH
          Yes you are.


INT. CAR - LATER

David drives, yawning, dead tired, checking the NAV on
his I-Phone. He SEES a WEATHER UPDATE, clicks: HEAVY FOG -
5 MILES AHEAD...But no sign of slowed/stopped traffic.

Kyrah occupies the backseat with Ky...Mother and son
whisper and giggle with one another, gleefully
reestablishing their bond and catching up on lost time.

                       DAVID
                 (holding up power cord)
          Kyrah, where do I plug in?

                         KYRAH
          Glove box.

David pops the glove box. It’s stocked with a first-aid
kit and road flares. He spots the USB port and plugs in.
                                                         61.


                       KY
          Daddy, can we play some music?!

                        DAVID
          Sure, bud.

David absently calls up the last playlist on the I-Phone.
It loads...and LIONEL RICHIE’S “TRULY” fills the car--

                       LIONEL RICHIE
          --girl, tell me only this, that I have
          your heart, for allllwaaaays--

--David reacts with minor panic and a marked wince,
quickly hitting pause, then hastily killing the volume--

                       KY
          DAD!? Why’d you stop it!?

David’s eyes dart to the rear-view, meeting Kyrah’s.
Clearly some shared history with this particular tune.

                        KYRAH
          Yeah, Dad!?

                       KY
          That’s your favorite song!

                       DAVID
                 (quickly/defensively)
          That’s not-- NO, bud, that’s not my
          favorite s--, that’s not even close to my
          favori--

                       KY
          --you listen to it a lot.
                 (innocently, to Kyrah)
          He listens to that song a lot, momma.

                       KYRAH
          He does, huh?

Kyrah’s gaze shifts back to the rear-view, this sly, shit-
eating grin forming...

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          ...well can I hear it?

David chortles, nervous, nodding...Kyrah toying with him.

                       DAVID
          Maybe we can just enjoy the quiet, huh?

Ky persists.
                                                         62.


                       KY
          Come on, Daddy! Play it for momma!
                 (to Kyrah)
          You want to hear it momma?

Kyrah leans in, enjoying David’s temporary torment.

                       KYRAH
          I really, really, really do!

David groans, battling back a scowl as he un-pauses the
song and restores its volume.

Ky begins belting out the lyrics, beautifully.

                       KY
          ...let me hold youuuuu, I need to have
          you, near meeeeee...and I feel with
          youuuu, in myyyyy heart, this love will
          last forever, because I’m truuuuuulllyyy,
          truly in love with you girl...!

Kyrah is amazed.

                       KYRAH
          Wow! Listen to that voice!
                 (beat, up to David)
          Did you know he could sing like this!?

David squirms, this pasted on half-smile. Ky continues
singing and now Kyrah joins in, full-throated.

David, miserable now, swipes one of his earbuds on the
sly, removing it from his right ear. This goes unnoticed.

WE ASSUME his aural state once again...muffled and muted
but somehow elevated and extra-sensory.

He can SEE them singing but can barely hear a thing.

Strands of FOG begin to appear now and slowly increase.
The fog congeals. Thickens like cloud cover. Goes opaque.

Headlights refract back glare and zero visibility.

David grips the wheel tighter, blasting through banks of
it now.

                       DAVID
          Kyrah, make sure he’s got his belt on.

Kyrah SEES the onrushing fog and straps Ky in.
                                                         63.


David kills the high-beams, diminishing the glare, his
focus pinpoint and almost preternatural as he wends his
way through the thickening banks.

He seems to sense something now, some approaching threat,
he checks the rear-view, SEES this silvery, shifting mass
rushing up behind-- barreling in fast--

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          --EVERYBODY HANG ON--!

--CRUUUNCH-- they’re struck from behind at high speed.

HIGHBEAMS are tripped from TWO PURSUIT VEHICLES, blinding
the Buick’s cab--

--Ky SHRIEKS, Kyrah instinctively covers him--

David jams the earbuds back in, SOUND POUNDS IN--

--GUNFIRE erupts. Tracer rounds streak past sub-
sonically, lighting the fog around them an infernal red--

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          --CONTACT REAR!!!

“MACHINE GUN” By THE COMMODORES begins playing over the
stereo, providing an oddly upbeat piece of disco/pop to
the brutal running gunfight/car chase that follows.

The PURSUIT car plows back into them, steel gnashing and
grinding, its engine revving out red-line as both cars
duel with one another in a high speed demolition derby.

David feels the Buick drift and slide. He rips the wheel
right, banking back in from the shoulder and punching it--
unleashing all 740 horses from that V-12 Switchout and
putting temporary distance on their pursuers.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          WHERE DID THEY COME FROM!?

David swerves around a slow moving CAR that materializes
out of the soupy fog suddenly--

--Kyrah acts quickly, pulling out the rear seat down and
accessing the trunk. She removes the lid that contained
the spare tire compartment. The tire is gone. The space
has been modified and reinforced to carry human cargo.

Kyrah instructs a terrified Ky to crawl inside.
                                                      64.


                       KYRAH
          Go baby! Stay in here and stay down, stay
          flat. It’s ok! You’re safe! Here--

--she snags a pair of “shooter’s cans” (soundproof
headphones) and slips them on her son, kissing his
forehead reassuringly before returning the lid--

--David, navigating nearly blind through the fog,
squinting at the rapidly onrushing road--

                       DAVID
          --Is he safe in there!?--

                       KYRAH
          --that’s the safest place in this car!

Suddenly, GUNFIRE pounds in from above, mushrooming the
Buick’s roof, the ballistic armor holding fast against
the brief fusillade--

--FLARES begin falling from the sky now, dozens of them,
burning these bright orange coronas of light as they
strike the road in front of the Buick, hurtling back--

                       DAVID
          --they’ve got a bird on us!

Kyrah reaches up, folds the front passenger seat forward
and collapses it. She then tears a kevlar’d section free,
revealing the seat itself to be stored with WEAPONS.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          Kyrah! How did they find us!?

                       KYRAH
          I have no idea David!

                       DAVID
          And where did they get air support--

                       KYRAH
          --could we focus on the fucking gunfight
          that we are presently in, PLEASE!

She grabs a FN F2000 ASSAULT RIFLE, charges it and primes
the weapon’s 40mm FN EGLM GRENADE LAUNCHER.

David suddenly turns off the headlights.

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          What the hell are you doing!?
                                                         65.


                       DAVID
          Don’t return fire yet! They’re running as
          blind as we are! They’re aiming at the
          lights!

David gazes out at the onrushing road and into the
impenetrable fog bank he’s barreling through.

                       KYRAH
          How the hell can you see!?

                       DAVID
          I can’t--

                       KYRAH
          We hit anything at this speed and we’ll
          be scattering our own ashes!

                       DAVID
          You want the wheel!?

                       KYRAH
          Don’t tempt me!

Another slow-moving CAR hurtles into view. David
reflexively avoids it, slaloming the vehicle at speed.

                       DAVID
                 (grousing aloud)
          Shoots better than me, drives better than
          me, why don’t you do-it-all-you’re-so-
          goddamned-good-at-everything--!

                       KYRAH
          Are you talking to yourself or is that
          meant for ME!? Just keep your full five
          on the road, please!

Kyrah straps the seat-belt across her back and leans
across the folded seat, targeting the sky above through
the T-top, looking for descending flares--

--RANDOM ROUNDS thump in, hitting the trunk.

                       DAVID
          We’re taking impact on that trun--

                       KYRAH
                 (rifle nuzzled)
          --It’s up-armored! Ky is fine!

Kyrah stands, aiming back down at the retreating road,
tracking movement with her aim--
                                                       66.


--liquid, shifting, impossible to pinpoint as their
PURSUERS melt in and out of the FOG.

Her patience frays into frustration, fast.

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          --alright, this is pissing me off.
          Listen, we’re gonna brake and we’re gonna
          brake hard on my count--

                       DAVID
          Wait, WHAT? Why?

                       KYRAH
                 (at the trunk)
          Ky! Baby!? Can you hear me?

From the trunk, this small voice, muffled--

                       KY
          --I hear you momma!

                       KYRAH
          I want you to hang onto those little hand-
          holds above your head, do you see them?

                       KY
          Yes!

                       KYRAH
          Ok, baby, hang on to those really tight!
          There’s gonna be a big bump but you’ll be
          ok, ok!? Don’t be scared! Just HANG ON!

                       KY
          Ok, momma!

Kyrah turns back to David.

                       KYRAH
                 (forgetting/distracted)
          Babe, list--
                 (adjusting/awkward)
          David, listen, on my count in three--

                       DAVID
          --Kyrah, what the hell are w--

                       KYRAH
          --Two--

                       DAVID
                 (getting ready)
          --Are you fucking serious!?--
                                                        67.


                       KYRAH
          --One-- HIT IT!--

--David rams the brakes and downshifts, feet-to-the-
floor. The car shudders and fishtails, WE ARE LOOKING
OVER KYRAH’S SHOULDER as a pursuit VEHICLE appears from
nowhere, colliding with their rear-end, bumpers locking--

--Kyrah UNLOADS at point-blank range. The pursuit car’s
radiator, grill and headlights DETONATE beneath the
barrage. Kyrah strafes the front tires, shredding them,
the car bites the pavement at speed--

--Kyrah pumps the grenade launcher THOOMP-THOOMP, putting
two 40mm slugs into the wildly careening car-- it
EXPLODES, catapulting end over end before barrel-rolling
off into the fog.

Kyrah, this big Cheshire grin for David when a huge
IMPACT knocks her across the seat as another pursuit car
rams them blind from the driver’s side.

BULLETS blaze point blank from the pursuit car,
blackening and bubbling the Buick’s ballistic glass and
pocking the side and quarter panels--

--the car bashes back into them--

--David seizes the wheel, struggling to stay on the road,
running over the rumble strip.

He sees reflectors up ahead, caught in their pursuers
headlamps--

--something parked at the side of the road.

He sideswipes the pursuit car, sending it onto the
shoulder as A BIG RIG, parked in the breakdown lane,
appears, too late to avoid--

--the pursuit car swerves to miss it but clips the back
end and caroms off, out of control.

Kyrah un-clips from her belt, clearing the Buick’s T-Top
and taking aim on the retreating road, FIRING fast bursts
back down it. Spent brass skates across the backseat.

David drives blind. His headlights remain off.

The fog flattens out and then thickens again. David’s
gaze snaps back to the NAV--

--Hairpin curves loom. Coming up hard.
                                                        68.


                       DAVID
          I’m hitting the lights! HANG ON!

David pops the high-beams and the horizon line behind
them lights up like flashbulbs at the Super Bowl--

--their pursuers unleash fusillades of artillery in a
blaze of blind-fire.

David cuts the headlights again.

Kyrah reloads and re-shoulders his assault rifle. Popping
back up into a firing position.

David eyes the NAV-- curves in less than a quarter mile.

They’re running out of time and running out of road.

The overburdened car begins to buck and wheeze. Pistons
rattling. Engine failing fast. David throws anxious looks
at the dash. His speed dipping. RPM’S nose-diving--

--then their right tire suddenly ruptures and blows clear
through the front fender. Splayed rubber and steel-belted
laminate blast through the cab like shrapnel.

The car SLAMS down. Grinds asphalt. The front axle snaps
in two as the car goes into a dead spin. The road pitches
away. Gravel & bramble assault the interior.

The car rams something-- fractured fence post and barbed
wire snag the vehicle’s frame as it flips on its roof,
rag-dolling David and Kyrah within--

--the car barrel-rolls again as it uprights and finally
grinds to an ugly, convulsing halt.

Smoke and steam rise from the ruined heap like a mushroom
cloud.

The engine raps out a death rattle in fried pistons and
scorched parts. Kyrah retreats to the trunk to check on
Ky. She cracks open the spare tire compartment to find
her son a little shaken but still in one piece.

She hugs him tightly.

After a moment of relative calm and recovery, a SOUND
like a snapping ship’s mast seems to spread beneath the
car itself...

                       KYRAH
          ...what the hell is that?
                                                         69.


David reaches down and flips on the headlights. Spindrift
swirls off a winter white surface in front of them.

He glances down at the dying NAV...and SEES that they are
presently sitting right in the middle of a lake.

                        DAVID
           Kyrah! MOVE!!

The car lurches violently forward and collapses through
ICE. The lake was frozen solid and now they’re sinking
fast.

Kyrah grabs Ky, swimming up and out the shattered rear
window as freezing LAKE WATER floods in. As it crests,
David takes a deep breath and goes for the glove box.

EXT.   FROZEN LAKE -- NIGHT

Kyrah lifts Ky up through the ragged hole in the ice. She
climbs out next, grabbing up Ky and rubbing him to keep
him from going hypothermic and freezing to death.

She circles the hole, staring down into the rippling
blackness below. Waiting. Dread building by the second...

                        KYRAH
           ...David!

Seconds stretch. Kyrah strains to SEE--

                        KYRAH (CONT’D)
                  (yelling down)
           --DAVID!!

He suddenly breaks the surface. Kyrah hauls him out onto
the ice, relieved. David, teeth chattering, drops the
FIRST AID KIT onto the ice, then pulls a pair of ROAD
FLARES from his coat, sparking one of them.

                        KYRAH (CONT’D)
           Smart man.

He plants it in the ice, it burns a phosphorous red. They
huddle tightly around Ky, desperate to warm him first.

It’s the first intimate space they’ve shared in ages and
they regard one another now. Former lovers. Inches apart.

                        KYRAH (CONT’D)
           That was...exciting.

                        DAVID
           Old times, huh?
                                                         70.


They draw closer still...then the HILLSIDE behind them
alights with the glow of approaching VEHICLES and the
steady thrum of ROTORS rise as a CHOPPER approaches.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          Come on, let’s move.

David tosses the flare in the water, extinguishing it as
they hustle Ky to the treeline at the edge of the lake.

Kyrah snaps back around-- their footprints are visible in
the snow, leading away from the lake--

--She debates what do but is forced to duck into the
dense forest as the chopper arrives--

                       KYRAH
          --our footprints!

                       DAVID
                 (realizing)
          Shit...

Both of them instinctively go for their 9mm sidearms.
They drop their clips and jack the slides. Clearing the
lake water from both the barrel and the firing mechanism.

The chopper circles, its searchlight strafing the surface
of the frozen lake, searching...

At that moment ENEMY VEHICLES arrive en masse at the edge
of hillside. FIGURES disembark. Floodlights pan and arc
over the scene.

David, Kyrah and Ky huddle in the heavy brush, watching
as the chopper’s rotor wash scatters the accumulated snow
from the lake’s surface and erases their footprints.

David draws them deeper into the brush, away from the
lakeside. Kyrah shrugs free, drawing her FN F2000 up and
taking aim on the hillside, gazing through the scope--

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          --Kyrah, what are you doing?

P.O.V.: KYRAH’S SCOPE - Those FIGURES on the
hillside...Kyrah recognizes each and every one...The five
remaining SHADOWS. Their former teammates...TOGETHER.

                        KYRAH
          Oh...No.

                        DAVID
          What is it?
                                                         71.


                         DAVID (CONT’D)
          Kyrah?

Kyrah settles into the weapon now, nuzzling it tight, eye
tight to the scope, aim traveling over her former
teammates, the crosshairs alighting on each, momentarily.

                       KYRAH
                 (with grim resolve)
          They’re all there, David. All of them.

                         DAVID
          The Shadows?

                       KYRAH
          I can get them.

David’s gaze darts to the hillside, then back to Kyrah.

                       DAVID
          You’ll give us up!

                       KYRAH
                 (determined, dead-eyed)
          I can end this.

Her finger slides from the trigger guard to the trigger.

                       DAVID
                 (whispering to her now)
          That weapon is at the edge of its range
          and if even if you capped all five, what
          about the rest of them?

Kyrah agonizes, every part of her wanting to pull that
trigger and take her chances...then she feels a tug at
her waist and looks down. Ky stares up, his voice low.

                       KY
          Momma? Are you ok?

Kyrah chokes back a sob before shouldering the weapon and
scooping him up into her arms. David leads them through
the undergrowth as the chopper’s searchlight finally
finds the hole-in-the-ice.

The chopper holds a tight orbit above as WE SEE the armed
convoy on the hillside begin to descend down.
                                                         72.


EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

David sparks the remaining flare, lighting the mouth of
an old earthen cave that seems suitably deep enough for
them to hide in. Ky peers out from behind his mother.

                       KY
          Are there bears in there, Daddy?

                       DAVID
          We’ve got guns bud, we’ll be fine.

                       KY
                 (suddenly incredulous)
          We can’t shoot the bears!

                       KYRAH
          Yeah, maybe they’re nice bears and not
          man-eaters...and made us porridge!

                       KY
                 (oblivious to mom’s sarcasm)
          Yeah, dad!


EXT. FROZEN LAKE - NIGHT - LATER

The scene around the hole-in-the-ice has now taken on all
the dimensions and drama of a full-blown clusterfuck.

ANINO and MORITI, their cellphones aimed down as they
orbit the hole, on a secured VIDEO CALL with Cinder. WE
SEE HIM ON-SCREEN, super pissed and stalking down a
corridor after being pulled from a black tie event...

                       CINDER (ON SKYPE)
          ...consider it buried treasure!

                       ANINO
          Sir?

                       CINDER (ON SKYPE)
          I want that goddamn car dredged up and
          those bodies recovered! Dead or alive,
          they’re worth 100 million dollars to you!

He disconnects. CYSGOD and SCATH scoff at this demand.

                       CYSGOD
          How the hell are we supposed to do that?

                       SCATH
          You can’t dive on this without wet-suits
          and torches.
                                                         73.


                       CYSGOD
          You’d also need a winch and about five-
          thousand foot-pounds of torque to have
          any shot at dragging it to the surface.

VARJO indicates a ARMORED HUMVEE at the edge of the lake.

                       VARJO
          That rig’ll do it.

Scath and Cysgod turn.

                       SCATH
          Too heavy, it’ll fall through the ice.

Varjo removes his entire tactical array, stripping down
to his skivvies.

                       CYSGOD
          You’re outta your fucking mind.

                       VARJO
          Look at you lot...Couple of pussies,
          dressed up like dicks.

And with that, Varjo drops feet first into the hole,
disappearing into the depths below...


INT. CAVE - LATER

The remaining road flare burns out in a roaring blaze of
a BONFIRE. David has strung a length of suturing wire
from the first-aid kit and secured it to either side of
the cave to allow their clothes to dry.

Ky is sound asleep, curled up close to the fire and
covered in an emergency poncho from the first-aid kit.

David and Kyrah sit across from each other...her in just
a bra and panties and David shirtless, in his boxers.
They are mid-conversation...

                       DAVID
          ...what did we expect?

                       KYRAH
          Not this kinda smoke. Not them teaming
          up.

                       DAVID
          50 million, five ways is still a lotta
          cash. I can’t say I’m surprised.
                                                      74.


Kyrah is clearly and deeply troubled by this news.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          What did you think they were gonna do,
          Kyrah? Line up single file like some
          silly ass kung-fu movie and fucking fight
          us, one at a time?

                       KYRAH
          We can’t beat them. Not united like that.
          And with the extra firepower Cinder’s
          throwing behind ‘em, they’re like the
          goddamned Legion Of Doom.

David, this fixed stare, popping his knuckles one by one.

                       DAVID
          I want to know how they found us.
                 (beat, pointed)
          There’s no way you were emanating?

                        KYRAH
          Impossible.

                       DAVID
          Then we got shopped.

                       KYRAH
          By Auntie? Not in a million.

                       DAVID
          What about Unc?

                        KYRAH
          Never.

David scratches his head, slides closer to the fire.
Kyrah scoots closer too and they find themselves sitting
side by side now, silently staring into the flames...

...Finally:

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          So you’ve been listening to our wedding
          song, huh?

                       DAVID
                 (clarifying)
          Our son has. He’s got this Lionel Richie
          fixation, especially “Truly”.

                       KYRAH
          I feel like we should get him on American
          Idol with that voice.
                                                         75.


                       DAVID
          Imagine if that were the worst of our
          worries, right now.

Kyrah leans against him, letting her head lightly rest on
his shoulder.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          ...so what do we do?

                       KYRAH
          Pray?

                       DAVID
          Not giving me a ton of confidence here.

                       KYRAH
          You gotta have it to give it.

                       DAVID
          Well don’t make it worse.

                       KYRAH
          I think that’s almost impossible now.

David pauses, considers their current fate...and realizes
that she might be right...

                       DAVID
          ...so have we hit rock bottom here?

                       KYRAH
                 (nodding in agreement)
          The earth’s core.

                       DAVID
          The earth’s core is made of fire.

Kyrah glances up at him with this small, pained smirk.

                       KYRAH
          Now who’s making it worse?

David scoffs, it turns into a short chuckle. Kyrah joins
him. Their laughter tapers off, returning them to the
crackling pop and hiss of the fire.

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          You know...I was always around. Nearby.
                 (a long pause, then)
          Two years ago, at this little carnival in
          the Southpoint Mall, in Durham--
                                                         76.


                       DAVID
          --you brushed my hand in a crowd.

Kyrah turns toward as WE FLASH TO:


INT. MALL - FLASHBACK

David lugs a much younger Ky through the mall, his left
arm at his side...A WOMAN’S HAND barely brushes his in
passing but WE SEE him react to this moment, and smile...

                                               RETURN TO:


INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS

Kyrah stares up at David intently. He stares back.

                       DAVID
          You don’t think I would know your touch?
          No matter how brief or fleeting it was?
                 (beat, laying himself bare)
          I know that like I know my next breath.

Kyrah, still staring, slowly tilts her head-- and then
leans in and kisses him abruptly, unexpectedly. He kisses
her back. Things heat up. They break. Nearly breathless.

They regard one another in the firelight for what feels
like an eternity...Then, she whispers to him, softly...

                       KYRAH
          ...I missed you, so much...

David just touches her face softly...not wanting to spoil
whatever this is with words. Then they kiss again,
harder, heavier.

He pulls her to him now and they entwine quietly, simply,
nothing forced, nothing rushed, every breath seemingly
synced to this perfect radiance passing between them.

Their eyes lock...and they feel their souls touch...at
once familiar and frightening...

They smile and they cry...and all at once, the time
between them seems to dissipate and dissolve and fall
away as they disappear into one another...
                                                         77.


INT. PENTAGON - CINDER’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Cinder comes stalking in, in his tux. Furious. Fit to be
tied. Patrick and Parker mewl immediate mea culpas--

                       PATRICK
          --sir, we’re deeply sorry--

                       CINDER
                 (tearing off his bow-tie)
          --well that’s wonderful. I find the raw
          power of an “apology” so fucking helpful
          in these moments.

                       PARKER
          They went off the road during the
          takedown, it was an unforeseen accid--

--Cinder rams an index finger into Parker’s chest--

                       CINDER
          --”UNFORSEEN” because you lack VISION my
          boy and the basic sweat and salt of
          experience! Too much time on treadmills
          and not enough running in the real world.

Cinder begins removing his coat and rolling up his
sleeves. He removes that small .380 SMITH & WESSON from
his rear waistband, pausing to study his hand a moment...

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          ...Y’know, I didn’t get my first manicure
          until I was 30.
                 (lightly touching his suit)
          Didn’t own a tailored suit till I was 40.
                 (to the Mercs)
          So you see me now, with the buff and
          polish and lapel pin and think I’ve never
          used a knife in my life or beaten a man
          half dead.
                 (spoken like a threat)
          But you’d be gravely, gravely mistaken.

Cinder’s forearms flex as he forms fists. Patrick and
Parker remain mute, motionless, fear building in both.

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          There’s a notion that with success comes
          this “softening”. That it slowly turns a
          man’s armor to silk, so, every once in
          awhile, I like to remind myself who I
          am...and conversely, who you are--
                                                        78.


--Cinder throws a fast, lacerating right hand that knocks
Patrick, flat-on-his-ass. Parker squares on his boss, his
instincts hard-wired to fight back, regardless.

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
                 (pleased by this)
          Atta boy! Defend yourself! FIGHT!

They circle one another. Cinder feints, then steps in and
throws a pinpoint perfect one-two-three combination, the
left hook finisher pitching Parker face first into a
coffee table and shattering it.

Patrick staggers back to his feet and Cinder makes short
work of him, beating him senseless until he collapses to
the carpet, weaving on his knees, his nose busted flat.

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
                 (barely out of breath)
          You’re both terminated. Be thankful I’m
          not talking about your lives.

Cinder’s cellphone chirps. He retrieves it from his coat.

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
                 (answering)
          Cinder.
                 (a beat, he listens, a smile)
          Good...then pick up the scent, please.

He clicks off, turns to his two bloodied/battered aides.

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          They survived.
                 (as he exits)
          You’ve both been rehired. Call me a car.

Patrick and Parker help one another to their feet. They
lick their wounds, wiping blood on their sleeves and
glowering after their boss as he departs.

Parker eyes Patrick. Some silent understanding passes
between them. Patrick just shakes his head, slowly...

                       PATRICK
                 (cryptically)
          ...not yet.


INT. CAVE - PRE-DAWN

David lurches up out of dead sleep. His head on a swivel,
snapping around, looking--
                                                         79.


--Ky slumbers...But Kyrah is gone...and David seems to
silently intuit, all the reasons why...

                       DAVID
          ...goddammit, girl...no.

He leaps up and begins gathering his clothes.


INT. BUS - DAY

Kyrah is jammed into the back of a crowded, overheated
Greyhound bus, teeming with tourists.

She unwraps a cheap burner phone and dials...


EXT. CINDER RESIDENCE - DAWN

Cinder performs those same tireless laps in the pool. His
dogs anxiously await him near that cooler of raw steaks.

His cell buzzes. The ringtone conveys the call’s urgency.

He hauls himself from the pool and dries off, answering:

                         CINDER
          Cinder.

Kyrah’s VOICE crackles back over the line.

                         KYRAH (V.O.)
          Hello, Jack.

Cinder resists his immediate reaction, letting his anger
flare and then quickly fade, then goes purposely still.

                       CINDER
          That’s Secretary Cinder, now...Ombra.

INTERCUT WITH:


EXT. DOCK - UNKNOWN - DAY

Kyrah on a burner cell, duffel bag lashed across her
back, walking along a busy dock.

                       KYRAH
          Oh...I know. All appointed and official
          sounding and even with an OIG
          investigation, nipping at your heels,
          here you are, hunting me down.
                                                       80.


                       CINDER
          And “Sombra”...and your kid too.

Kyrah recoils against this sudden rush of fear she feels.

                        CINDER (CONT’D)
                 (intuiting her reaction)
          Wondering how I found you so fast?
                 (beat, matter-of-fact)
          There isn’t a distance you can travel
          where I can’t reach you, or a hole deep
          enough to hide where I won’t find you.
                 (beat)
          You really want to run for the rest of
          your life?
                 (beat, pure menace)
          One that’s growing shorter by the second.

Cinder uses a separate cell to start a trace on her.

                       KYRAH
          I have a proposition.

                       CINDER
          Besides killing you?

                       KYRAH
          Feels a little “limiting” doesn’t it?

                       CINDER
          You know what the most unsentimental
          thing in the world is, sweetheart?
                 (beat, chillingly)
          Revenge.

                       KYRAH
          It’s also the most expensive.

                       CINDER
          100 million is more than worth it.

                       KYRAH
                 (truly shocked)
          You doubled the bounty on us?

                       CINDER
          And I intend to triple it by week’s end.

                       KYRAH
          Even with your entire department in the
          crosshairs of a federal investigation.
                 (a nervous chuckle)
          I can’t help but feel a little flattered
          here, Jack...a little, flushed.
                       (MORE)
                                                      81.

                       KYRAH (CONT'D)
                 (a change-up, a challenge)
          You want me.

A pause. Charged.

                        CINDER
          I do...
                 (then)
          ...On your knees. Begging for your life.

                       KYRAH
          Not really my jam, Jack.
                 (beat, girding herself)
          Let David and my son, go. Call off the
          Shadows and I will come to you.

There’s a tinge of doubt in her voice that Cinder clocks,
triggering his suspicion...and this supposition...

                       CINDER
          ...He couldn’t cut it, could he? Dear old
          David...And now you’re scared. He’s been
          playing Mr. Mom too long and he’s lost
          his touch. Five years ago, you two would
          have taken on your entire team...and won.

                       KYRAH
          If it’s war you want, Jack. Keep coming.
          Or accept my offer.

                       CINDER
          What about my wife?

                       KYRAH
          That didn’t seem to bother you before.

We can SEE Cinder mulling this over, his feelings for her
mixed but very real and worth rationalizing, right now.

                       CINDER
          So you’re just going to leave your boy
          and your true love and--

                       KYRAH
                 (with a real edge)
          --we’re not in love anymore.
                 (beat, then)
          But he is the father of my son and as
          such, I want him spared.
                 (beat, imploring)
          Call them off, Jack.
                 (beat, the enticement)
          You want me.
                       (MORE)
                                                         82.

                         KYRAH (CONT'D)
            I can feel it, now, even through the
            phone...You’ve conquered everything
            you’ve ever encountered.
                   (beat, the dagger)
            Except me.

                         CINDER
            How do I know you’re not just trying to
            get close to me and do what you do best.

                         KYRAH
            Suicide Missions aren’t my style.

Cinder checks his watch. Impatient now. Makes a decision.

                         CINDER
            Where are you?

                         KYRAH
            It’s not where I am, it’s where I can be.
            Still have that boat on the Chesapeake?

                         CINDER
            Oh no, I have a much bigger boat now.
            Docked down in the Outer Banks.

                         KYRAH
            Tarheel Country.

                         CINDER
            Far away from prying eyes...

                         KYRAH
            ...then I’ll see you out on the water.

Kyrah clicks off. Cinder checks the other cell. No trace.


EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

Kyrah rips the back off the cell and throws the battery
into the water, retrieving another BURNER from her coat.

She powers it up as she moves up the dock, past a SIGN:

BOAT RENTALS - JET-SKIS - PARA-SAILING

Kyrah begins typing out a specific numerical code into
the burner phone...
                                                        83.


EXT. PARK - DAY

Auntie and Unc, low profile in that same park and
surreptitiously recording those same SHADY SLEAZEBAGS...

                       SHADY SLEAZEBAG #1
          ...I had this above-ground pool as a kid
          and my friends and I heard this noise,
          this crazy, whatever-it-was, like
          something howling but high pitched and we
          look over the fence and the neighbor’s
          dog, this Dachshund, named “Kaiser” was
          literally fucking the family cat--
                 (as Shady Sleazebag #2 bursts
                  out laughing)
          --I’m not kidding, as God is my-- just
          going to town on this cat, that looks
          like it’s lovin’ every second. I never
          laughed that hard in my life...

Auntie is once again, furiously transcribing this
conversation while shaking her head at the same time.

                       AUNTIE
          This shit is all kinds of funky. I don’t
          like it.

                       UNC
          Don’t like what?

                       AUNTIE
          These two go from talking about large
          scale, illegal weapons transactions for
          five weeks straight to interspecies
          fucking? To dogs smashin’ cats n’shit?

                       UNC
          I mean, if it happened, it’s funny.

                       AUNTIE
          That’s not the point. It’s like they’re
          playing pretend now. Like they’re gaming
          it...You think they got tipped off to us?

Unc’s cellphone suddenly pings. He checks it.

                       AUNTIE (CONT’D)
          Kyrah?

Unc nods curtly. Offers no follow up. Auntie waits...

                       AUNTIE (CONT’D)
          ...and?
                                                         84.


                       UNC
                 (as he pockets the phone)
          It’s coded. Can’t decrypt it right now.

                       AUNTIE
          Why?

Unc points, the Shady Sleazebags are exiting the park.

                       AUNTIE (CONT’D)
          Let’s follow ‘em.


INT. VAN - LATER

Auntie and Unc slide in, closing their respective doors.
A VOICE from the backseat startles them--

                       DAVID
          --Don’t turn around. Just drive.

Unc checks the rear-view and SEES David and Ky, lying on
the floorboard. He puts the van in gear and pulls away.

                       UNC
          How’d you find us?

                       DAVID
          Haven’t been out of the game that long.
                 (beat, to his son)
          Ky, this is Auntie and Unc...They used to
          be mommy and daddy’s friends, when we
          were all good guys.

                       KY
          Are they still your friends, Daddy?

                       DAVID
          That’s what I’m wondering.

                       KY
          Do they know where Momma went?

                       DAVID
          Let’s find out.
                 (beat, to Auntie & Unc)
          I’ve got a--
                 (spelling it out)
          --P.I.S.T.O.L., in my right hand.

                       KY
          What did you spell, Daddy?
                                                       85.


                       DAVID
          Nothing, bud. Just-- let Daddy talk--

                       AUNTIE
                 (eyeing rear-view mirror)
          --Where is she?

                       DAVID
          That’s what I came to ask you.
                 (beat, grave)
          If she was only in comms with the two of
          you, and then one of you, shopped us.

                       UNC
          You trippin’.

                       AUNTIE
                 (spelling it out)
          I’d rather be D.E.A.D.

                       DAVID
          That is rapidly becoming a reality.

Ky is blissfully unaware of the bubbling tension brewing
between the adults--

                       KY
                 (to Auntie and Unc)
          --Do you have Lionel Richie?

                       DAVID
          Ky, not right now, ok, please?

Auntie & Unc cackle abrupt, then crack up. Can’t help it.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          It’s not funny.

Ky grins. Pleased with himself for making the adults
laugh.

                       AUNTIE
                 (in between laughs)
          Little man, if you want some Lionel
          Richie, Auntie’s gonna hook you up.

                       DAVID
          He doesn’t need music.

                       KY
          One song, Dad!
                                                        86.


                       UNC
                 (still laughing)
          Come on, D. It don’t need to be this
          tense, let’s bring the temperature down.

Auntie begins playing “HELLO”. Ky objects right away.

                       KY
          No! Not that one! That one’s sad!

                       AUNTIE
          Ooops, sorry baby!

                       DAVID
          Just play “Truly” he likes that song.

                       AUNTIE
          I don’t have that one on my phone.

                       UNC
          You like Al Green, little man?

                       DAVID
          Bud, just let me talk to them, ok? We’ll
          play Lionel Richie later--

--but Auntie calls up “DANCING ON THE CEILING” which Ky
loves. David quietly admonishes his son now:

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          Ok, they’ll play the song but no singing.

Ky nods, mouthing the words silently.

David leans up toward Auntie and Unc in the front seat,
his tone a low, loaded menace...

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          How long have you been helping her?

                       AUNTIE
          The whole time she’s been in the breeze.
          We’ve got a trace echo that hijacks any
          top secret burst transmissions on CIA-
          active towers, all over the world.

                       DAVID
          How the hell did you do that?

                       UNC
          Very carefully.

                       DAVID
          What was your last link with her?
                                                         87.


                       AUNTIE
          She just hit up, Unc. Ten minutes ago.

                       UNC
                 (hasty, dismissive)
          Nah, that wasn’t her.

                       AUNTIE
          Who was it then?

David leans in tighter, pressing, losing patience now.

                       DAVID
          What was your last link!?

                       UNC
          I told her to dump the burner and stay
          off civilian comms.

                       AUNTIE
          She didn’t tell you where she was headed?

                       DAVID
          No...
                 (realizing now)
          ...which tells me where she’s going.

                       UNC
          Where?

A grim reality takes shape. One David is struggling with.

                       DAVID
          Cinder. Solo.

          AUNTIE                          UNC
Shit.                           Why?

                       DAVID
                 (shakes head in disbelief)
          It’s what she’s been doing for years...
                 (the gravity of it)
          ...Protecting us.


EXT. OUTER BANKS - NORTH CAROLINA COAST - DAY

Kyrah motors into view in a rented Scarab, entering the
long shadow of a PRINCESS 30M: A multi-million dollar,
one hundred foot “Super-Yacht”, seized by U.S. Customs.
                                                         88.


INT./EXT. PRINCESS 30M YACHT - CONTINUOUS

Kyrah docks alongside and is helped up onto the stern by
Parker and Patrick. She’s quickly pat-frisked for any
weapons and cleared.

Cinder is waiting for her, looking as regal as a Royal
Duke and smoking a Cuban Maduro.

                       CINDER
                 (glancing around)
          Y’gotta love a drug lord’s opulence
          almost as much as their stupidity.
          Thinking they could load 100 k’s into the
          hull of this and run it up from Bogota
          without the Coast Guard getting curious.

                       KYRAH
          This all yours now, Jack?

                       CINDER
          Let’s just say it’s on “Permanent Loan”
          to the State Department.

Kyrah smiles thin, shaking her head at him.

                       KYRAH
          Like a pig in mud. Nothing’s changed.

                        CINDER
          Oh, everything’s changed, baby.
                 (beat)
          Me? I’m on top of the world...and you?
          You’re about to be wiped from it.

Cinder turns to one of his SHIP STEWARDS, who snaps to
attention with a pure-purposed, Pavlovian zeal.

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          Could you pour this young lady a double
          of Johnny Walker Blue?

                       KYRAH
          Reading my mind.

                       CINDER
          I remembered.
                 (with a menacing wink)
          And I feel like you might need it.

                       KYRAH
          The feeling’s mutual.
                                                      89.


EXT. AUNTIE & UNC’S HOME - DAY

A modest tract development of largely prefab homes at the
rear of a dead-end cul-de-sac.

Auntie and Unc disembark. David and Ky slide out of the
back-- David primed, eyes peeled, gun flush to his thigh.

                       DAVID
          Are we safe here?

                       AUNTIE
          There’s zero eyes on this place.

                       UNC
          We’re cool. We keep a few of these cribs
          on rotation, way off-grid.

They reach the front door. Something is tweaking David.
The all-too-familiar “fear-tingle” that intuits bad shit.

                       DAVID
          And you sure we’re clean?

Unc smiles flatly, nodding, like something pre-mediated.


INT./EXT. PRINCESS 30M YACHT - DAY

Cinder slow burns Kyrah, a look stranded somewhere
between anger and lust. She smiles seductively as the
Steward returns with a big tumbler of Johnny Walker Blue.

She nods, raising the glass toward Cinder. He returns the
gesture, then gently sips the whiskey, eyes still locked
on her. Kyrah scoffs at him and drains the entire glass.

She signals for a refill. The Steward obliges.

                       CINDER
          Beautiful woman. Great whiskey. Sea
          surrounding. We should just set sail now.

Kyrah sets her glass down and then slowly saunters over
to him, nodding toward Parker/Patrick and the STEWARD.

                       KYRAH
          I’m not much for an audience, Jack.

Cinder eyes her lasciviously, reluctant to dismiss them.
Kyrah closes the gap, getting into his personal space,
pressing up to his chest and whispering softly...
                                                      90.


                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          ...If you can’t handle me now, Jack...
                 (pure sexual predation)
          ...how can you hope to handle me later?

Cinder. His eyes ablaze with possibilities.


INT. AUNTIE & UNC’S HOME - DAY

David and Ky enter. Sparsely furnished. Monastic.
Temporary. A place designed to be abandoned, post haste.

                       DAVID
          Can I get cleaned up?

                       KY
          I’m hungry, Dad.

Unc indicates the rear of the house.

                       UNC
          Down that hall, bathroom on the right,
          spare bedroom on the left. Some clothes
          in the closet.
                 (quickly, to Ky)
          Little man, let’s get you some food.

Ky nods as Unc guides him toward the kitchen. Auntie can
tell that there’s something funky about Unc’s behavior...

                       AUNTIE
          What’s up with this buzz you got?

                       UNC
          What “buzz”? I ain’t got no buzz--

                       AUNTIE
                 (suspiciously now)
          --You buzzin’. I known you twenty years
          and when you’re off, I can feel it.

                       UNC
          Woman you trippin’, as usual.
                 (ruffling Ky’s head)
          Let’s get this youngster fed.

Unc leads Ky toward the kitchen, it feels rushed. Auntie
looks back down the hall as David enters the spare room.
                                                         91.


INT./EXT. PRINCESS 30M YACHT - DAY

Cinder waves Patrick/Parker and the Steward away as Kyrah
nuzzles into him, her hands wrapping around his waist. He
squeezes her tightly, inhaling her.

She gazes up at him, sheepishly.

                       KYRAH
          ...I never thought it would be this
          easy...Getting close like this.

                       CINDER
          I knew you’d come back to me. I know you
          too well. Trained you. Taught you.

                       KYRAH
          You know my tendencies.

                       CINDER
          I do.

                       KYRAH
          Like I know yours.

                       CINDER
          You’re a bad habit, baby.

Cinder leans down to kiss her. Kyrah halts him with--

                       KYRAH
                 (an evil little grin)
          --I know an even worse one, Jack--

--she moves now, fast as a rattlesnake strike, yanking
that little .380 SMITH & WESSON from Cinder’s rear
waistband, jamming it flush to his chest and FIRING--
--BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!

He’s blown across the deck.

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          I was hoping that might be there.

Patrick and Parker come rushing in, Kyrah spins back and
has them both dead-bang behind the barrel of that .380--

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          DOWN! DOWN! DOWN!

She closes the gap quickly. They can tell she means
business and quickly flatten themselves out at her feet.
                                                        92.


She disarms them both, kicking their weapons away...but
failing to realize that Cinder is sitting up behind her,
like the unkillable killer in some fucking slasher flick.

ANINO & MORITI materialize out of the shadows behind him.


INT. AUNTIE & UNC’S HOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - DAY

David is changing into a fresh set of clothes when he
HEARS what sounds like Auntie SHOUTING and then, like a
cord had been cut, silence...

...there’s a soft KNOCK on his door. David slowly brings
the business end of that pistol to bear on it.

                       DAVID
          ...Yeah? I’m just changing...

...He waits for a response...none follow...He edges
toward the door now, thumbing the pistol’s hammer back.

As he reaches it, the door suddenly DETONATES around him.
A BATTERING RAM, bashing through and shattering the
surrounding jamb. David shields himself as MEN swarm in,
quickly overpowering and subduing him--

--Punches and pistol butts rain down. David is beaten
bloody, struggling in vain to defend himself.

Finally, the blows cease and a battered David gapes up to
find a grinning, gargantuan VARJO, looming over...

                       VARJO
          ...Hola, motherfucker.

CYSGOD and SCATH and there as well, gloating.

                       CYSGOD
          How’s things?

                       SCATH
          We missed you man, you never write!

David sneers up at them, then stands wobbly. Varjo greets
him at the top with a sudden right cross that catches him
right on the jaw, rocking him. He reels. Spits blood.

                       DAVID
          Varjo, for all your size, your shit’s
          never had snap. Hands like throw pillows.

Varjo throws another hard shot, but David slips it with
suprising speed and counters with a brutal overhand.
                                                         93.


Scath attacks now but David sidesteps and leg-whips him,
cratering his right knee.

Scath HOWLS as Cysgod engages with David now, head-
butting him from behind and scrambling his senses as
Varjo grabs him and slams him halfway through a sheetrock
wall...David just smiles, elbowing Varjo in the throat.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          Let’s get those licks in, boys!

Cysgod front ball kicks David from behind, then rips
concussive hooks to his body, stealing his air.

David wheezes hard, weaving toward a hobbling Scath and
jutting his chin at him--

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          --C’mon punk, like your momma taught you--

--Scath unloads, connecting with a big crashing haymaker
that buckles David’s knees and drops him to the carpet.

Varjo looms over. David lunges for the THAI PARANG
MACHETE he wears around his leg.

                       VARJO
          You want this, asshole?

Varjo unsheathes the blade slowly.

                       VARJO (CONT’D)
          Here you go--

--He abruptly brings the hilt end of the blade down on
the top of David’s skull, knocking him out cold.


INT./EXT. PRINCESS 30M YACHT - DAY

Kyrah turns around slowly, SEEING her two former
teammates, ANINO and MORITI, advancing on her, automatic
weapons chin-welded as they fan out and flank her.

Cinder stands, popping open his coat to reveal a KEVLAR
VEST, with four smashed slugs, still smoking.

He coughs out a pained rasp of a breath.

                       CINDER
          Yeah, that feels about how you think it
          would feel, being shot that many times.
                 (to Kyrah, with this snarl)
          Someone was, determined.
                                                      94.


Kyrah raises her hands, dropping the .380. Parker/Patrick
pop back up and retrieve their weapons, surrounding her.

Cinder, absently touching his vest where he was hit, hand
sliding over his abdomen slowly, thoughtfully. His eyes
grow vacant, fixed on some far off thought...

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          ...You said “Suicide Missions” weren’t
          your thing...You also said you didn’t
          love him anymore...you’re a liar, lady.

                       KYRAH
          I learned it from the best. You.

                       CINDER
          I really thought we had something.

                       KYRAH
          You were my boss. What choice was there?
          And I loved someone else...and that meant
          more to me than you, or the team--

                       CINDER
          --Oh, we’re, well aware of all that now.
                 (indicating Anino and Moriti)
          These ladies having also suffered the
          slings and arrows of your treacherous
          bullshit...not only breaking up the unit,
          but then hunting down and killing six of
          your fellow teammates?
                 (beat, a big shrug)
          I don’t know gals, feels like you both
          might need a “pound of flesh”--

                       MORITI
          --or a few pounds.

                       ANINO
          I like the sound of that alot more.

Cinder cackles now. As Moriti and Anino stow their
weapons and assume fight stances.

                       CINDER
          Ombra, for as good as you might’ve been
          once babydoll, you have fallen off just
          as fast. Did you really think I’d just
          let you walk in here and kill me, the
          Secretary of Defense, in cold blood?

                       KYRAH
          Can I say I was hopeful?
                                                        95.


Cinder strips the Velcro off his Kevlar vest and tosses
it away, retrieving that Johnny Walker Blue and taking a
big tug off the bottle.

                       CINDER
          This should be a lot of fun to watch.
                 (to Anino and Morit)
          Work her over, ladies. Just don’t hit her
          in the face...save that for me.

Anino and Moriti square on Kyrah, who invites it.

                       KYRAH
          Wade on in bitches...come get some.

The three of them clash violently, viciously, and the
fighting is high-speed and expert level.

The tactics and training that each employ is the sum and
substance of years spent as elite, sui generis soldiers.

Even outnumbered, two-to-one, Kyrah is formidable and
ferocious and her former teammates must work in tandem to
ultimately take her down and subdue her.

As the conflict subsides, Cinder is there, staring down
at his former fling, this flinty look of pity for her...

                       CINDER
          ...this is the last time I’ll be wrong
          about you...

...then he brings his boot down, bashing her unconscious.

BLACK

FADE UP ON:


INT/EXT. PRINCESS 30M YACHT - DAY

Kyrah, coming to, groggy, shackled to a deck chair, a
strong swirling wind kicking up, enveloping her.

She cracks open her eyes and SEES an AIRBUS/EUROCOPTER EC
120B HELICOPTER, touching down on the larger deck above.

A GO-FAST BOAT arrives at the same time, docking off the
Starboard side of the vessel.

DAVID disembarks the chopper, bruised and battered, flex-
cuffed and led at gunpoint by CYSGOD. SCATH and VARJO
climb down from the main canopy’s pilot/co-pilot seats.
                                                         96.


David meets Kyrah’s gaze, despondent, despaired. Kyrah’s
stomach drops like dead weight, her throat going dry, the
horrible realization that her son is nowhere in sight--

--then, Ky is there, looking fragile and frightened,
until he SEES his mom and dad...and then the briefest bit
of relief flashes across his little face.

He waves at them...

...and it breaks David and Kyrah’s hearts on the spot.

                       CINDER
                 (to Parker/Patrick)
          Take the young man below deck for the
          moment, please.
                 (At Kyrah and David, grim)
          We’re not ready just yet.

Kyrah manages a smile for her son as he’s marched past.

                       KYRAH
          It’s alright baby. We’re here.

Patrick and Parker guide Ky toward the aft stairs. He
keeps looking back at his parents as he’s led away.

The Shadows strip off their gear, setting their weapons
on a large dining room table and sitting down behind it.

David is shoved down next to Kyrah and shackled
alongside. They regard one another, their injuries, etc.

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          I’m sorry, baby. I didn’t want to involve
          you. I wanted to keep you two safe, I--

                       DAVID
          --I know why you did what you did.
                 (reassuring her)
          It’s ok, love.

Auntie arrives, in cuffs, trailed by Unc...who is not.
Kyrah scowls.

                       KYRAH
          You sonofabitch.

                       AUNTIE
          Oh girl, you don’t even know what I’m
          ‘bout to do to this traitorous-ass little
          hoe, these cuffs ever come off.

Cinder smiles, handing Unc a PELICAN CASE.
                                                        97.


                       CINDER
          Old ‘Unc here knows the true value of
          loyalty to his country.

                       UNC
                 (grinning at the case)
          Yeah, ‘bout three mil and change.

                       AUNTIE
          Twenty years, ride or die with your punk
          ass and you dime me and your
          motherfuckin’ country out, FOR MONEY!?

                       UNC
          I been sick of y’bullshit for years! All
          you do is salt me, all you do is bitch.

                       AUNTIE
          Oh, you gonna see some bitchin’! I got
          something to say about how shit go down
          here and you gonna see it, up-close-
          personal-point-blank-style, bitch.

Auntie is placed in a chair opposite Kyrah and David. Unc
lingers behind her. David stares daggers through him.

MERCS arrive on deck now, carrying larger PELICAN CASES
and placing one in front of each of the five remaining
SHADOWS: CYSGOD. VARJO. SCATH. ANINO. MORITI, who each
pop their case and confirm their identical payouts.

                       CINDER
          Twenty million apiece.
                 (to Kyrah and David)
          And they barely even broke a sweat.

David gapes over at Kyrah, confused. She nods back
numbly.

                       KYRAH
          He doubled it.

The Shadows chuckle spitefully. Cinder crosses to our
couple now, relishing their defeat, reveling in it.

                       CINDER
          So here’s the thing...I kind of, sort of
          want to murder your kid, in front of you.

They rattle their restraints, lunging up at him--
                                                      98.


                        CINDER (CONT’D)
                 (shrugging, fake exasperated)
          --Now I know that sounds harsh but let me
          just lay out my logic and I think you’ll
          understand “why”...I put five long years
          worth of sweat and toil into creating
          Shadow Force. Five years and you two,
          with your deceit and your disloyalty,
          took it from me. The thing I loved most.
                 (beat, malevolently)
          Ky is about five, isn’t he?
                 (deadpan)
          And isn’t he the, “Thing You Love Most”?
                 (beat)
          So you see, me, in effect, killing him,
          makes us more or less, even. Doesn’t it?

Kyrah shifts tact, tries to reason with Cinder now,
desperate to save her son.

                       KYRAH
          Jack--

                       CINDER
                 (exploding down at her)
          --YOU BROKE A BLOOD OATH! An obligation
          to ALL OF US, you swore to uphold, under
          the penalty of death. THAT WAS THE DEAL!!

                       KYRAH
          You were turning the unit on itself,
          playing teammates off one another.
          Manipulating us. Poisoning us.

                       CINDER
          It’s easy to frame it that way, isn’t it,
          “Ombra”? Then your betrayal becomes my
          problem. Forget duty. Honor. Your
          commitment to your country!

                       DAVID
          All this star-spangled boy scout
          bullshit, from a fake-ass fucking
          “patriot”. We went from targeting
          terrorists to activating against your
          personal political rivals. All you were
          ever looking to do, was line your pockets
          and cement your power, Cinder. SAY IT!

Cinder scoffs, turning his back on them.

                       KYRAH
          Did you tell everybody about us, Jack?
          Our little affair.
                       (MORE)
                                                       99.

                        KYRAH (CONT'D)
                 (staring Cinder down)
          He lied to me, which he’s brilliant at
          but then I found out his marriage was
          still very much intact and broke it off.
                 (beat)
          And when he couldn’t keep fucking me the
          way he wanted to, he started fucking me
          the way he needed to. Threatening to
          relieve me of my command and strip me of
          rank.
                 (beat, with a scowl)
          And then came the little comments about
          “going dark” and “black ops” and I knew
          he was hinting at something else,
          something ugly and shitty and -I thought-
          way beneath him. But no, he was spurned
          and he was pissed off at the world
          because for all of his power...
                 (beat, right at Cinder)
          ...he couldn’t get a little “colored
          girl” to love him...isn’t that right,
          Jack?

Cinder returns, kneeling down to face her, gloating.

                       CINDER
          Watch how fast I wipe that little smirk
          off your face, bitch. You ready?

Cinder stands and turns back as Patrick and Parker return
to the fore deck...but Ky isn’t accompanying them...

                       CINDER (CONT’D)
          Where’s the kid?

                       PARKER
          He’s safe and sound below deck.
                 (beat, cryptic)
          We didn’t want him to see this.

Cinder bristles. His big moment being ruined.

                       CINDER
          See WHAT, you fucking idiot!?

Patrick and Parker simultaneously produce .45 AUTOS from
their suit coats and take aim on their now former boss--

                       PARKER
          --Secretary Cinder, by order of the
          Office Of The Investigator General, you
          are hereby being remanded into our
          custody and transferred to the NSA Navel
          Annex at Norfolk, to await arraignment.
                                                         100.


Cinder seems suspended in place, frozen, dumbfounded.
Patrick and Parker slowly fan out on either side of him.

Everyone seems stunned and shocked by this plot twist--

                       CINDER
          --what in the fuck are you talking abo--

                       PATRICK
          --we’re Special Agents with OIG and
          Justice. We’ve been building up a
          criminal case against you for months.

The Shadows get cagey quick. Leone-like leers aimed at
Patrick and Parker--

                       VARJO
          --So you two assholes are suddenly
          “undercover” and arresting your own boss?

                       CYSGOD
          This smells like straight bullshit.

                       SCATH
          Every bit of it and I’m not buying.

                       MORITI
          Seems “staged” to me.

                       VARJO
          Fake as fuck.

                       ANINO
          And I’ll bet you seize everything on this
          boat, too, huh? Including our money.

Kyrah and David can SEE Cinder reeling and unraveling and
quickly spike that situation, adding their own spin--

                       KYRAH
          --trying to rip off the team, Jack?

                       DAVID
          Never trust a politician.

                       PATRICK
          We are Federal Agents and you will comply
          with our deman--

--Scath moves suddenly, whiplash fast, going for his gun--

--Parker kills him before he clears his holster with a
single shot to the head.
                                                         101.


Scath collapses onto the table, pulling his Pelican case
over on top of himself and dropping to the floor, dead.

                       PARKER
          The Coast Guard and members of the Naval
          JAG Corps are inbound to assist in this
          apprehension.

                       PATRICK
          Do not attempt to move against us, or we
          will respond with further lethal force.

There is a veritable arsenal on the table, at arm’s
length...and none of them seem keen on “going quietly”.

This situation is quickly going from a simmer to a boil.

David and Kyrah begin to laugh, a titter that turns tidal
and gradually becomes a full blown gut-buster. Auntie
joins in as well, mocking the seeming crushing defeat
that’s happening to Cinder, right in front of them.

Cinder seethes, red hot.

                       PARKER
          It’s over sir. Place your hands in the
          air and get on your knees.

                       KYRAH
          On. Your. Knees. Jack.

                       DAVID
          Never thought I’d see it.

Varjo stews, staring at his SIG-SAUER 9mm, on the table,
only inches away. He gently nudges Cysgod, who glances
sidelong at the TACTICAL SHOTGUN sitting near his elbow.

Patrick rushes in on Cinder, jamming that .45 at him--

                       PATRICK
                 (forcefully)
          --Down on your knees!

Unc bolts off. Running. Patrick and Parker instinctively
turn to track his flight, taking their aim off Cinder--

--and that’s split-second diversion the Shadows needed.

“Fight Or Flight” kicks in as the strained situation
severs completely--
                                                         102.


SHADOWS

They snag sidearms and FLIP the dining table in unison--

--the remaining weapons spill to the floor, skating away.

Someone SHOUTS “SET-UP!” someone else SHOUTS “KILL ‘EM!”--

--A third VOICE bellows “GET THE CASES!”

Factions reform fast and EVERYONE STARTS SHOOTING--

The MERCS are caught in the crossfire, one is cut down--

--Cinder SCREAMS over the cannonade, trying to restore
order and pull it back from the tipping point--

--BUT IT’S TOO LATE--

--Confusion fuels chaos like a wild fire and soon enough
it’s a full-blown clusterfuck.

The endless exchange of BULLETS beats a deafening DIN.

DAVID & KYRAH

David rears back, tipping over, the chair shattering
beneath his weight as he snakes loose of his shackles.

Cinder SEES this and spins back, taking aim on KYRAH.

David reacts, pulling her over backwards as Cinder FIRES--

--BAM!BAM!BAM!
--the rounds sail wide, missing their mark--

One of the MERCS lobs something into the shootout--

--TING-TING-TING--

--the telltale metallic trundle of a tossed GRENADE--

David kick-shoves Kyrah the opposite way, clearing her
from the blast radius as the explosive DETONATES--

--bright white light blinds and burns as noxious
phosphorous smoke floods and fries his lungs.

David is loopy, disoriented.

CINDER
                                                        103.


Finds an AR-15 on the floor, slaps the stock, charges it
and runs right into PATRICK, who is about to speak when
Cinder UNLOADS that Assault-Rifle right into his chest,
stripping him of his .45 AUTO in the process.

Patrick pinwheels, then face-plants into the deck, dead.

Parker FIRES on Cinder, who retreats behind a couch.

KYRAH

Freeing Auntie and pulling her into a small alcove as she
presses Cinder’s fallen .380 S&W PISTOL into her hand.

                       KYRAH
          Get to my son!

Auntie nods, rushing off.

PARKER

The remaining MERC appears and backshoots Parker, who
goes sprawling hard, the .45 loosed from his grip.

Auntie engages the Merc, kneecapping him with a double-
tap from that .380, then finishing him off up close.

She drags Parker to cover, returning his .45 AUTOMATIC--

                       AUNTIE
                 (slapping gun into his hand)
          --Where’s the boy!?

UNC

Below deck and looking for a way off this boat, lugging
that PELICAN CASE along for dear life.

He moves quickly through from the aft toward the stern.

DAVID

This incessant pitched WHINE fills his head as he tries
to recalibrate and get his bearings, post blast.

GUNFIRE rocks close, he backpedals across the deck,
looking for cover, anything to hide behind--

--SHAPES coalesce out of the billowing gun/grenade smoke.

HIS FORMER TEAMMATES...stalking their prey in the haze.

David rams into a wall, running out of room.
                                                         104.


They’re nearly upon him, he gropes for any semblance of a
weapon--

--then suddenly one is thrust into his hand, a 9MM PISTOL
and Kyrah’s face in there in front of his, smiling. They
kiss impulsively and break just as fast.

                       KYRAH
          Remember when you said “mommy and daddy
          were gonna fuck some shit up”...

David nods as Kyrah charges the AK-47 she’s sourced
during the skirmish.

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          I think it might be about that time.

David racks the slide on the 9mm she gave him.

                       DAVID
          Then let’s do what we do, boo.

They rise up and ENGAGE their former teammates in unison,
overlapping FIRING PATTERNS and TACTICAL PROFICIENCY
sending the Shadows scattering and scrambling for cover.

David & Kyrah move with an almost-Olympian precision and
poise, skill sets in total lockstep with muscle memory.

We now see exactly why they co-commanded this unit.

UNC

Searching for an exit. He rounds a corner and finds KY
standing their in the middle of the corridor.

Ky’s expression sours when he sees Unc. He points at him.

                       KY
          You were mean to Auntie and Daddy at your
          house! You had a gun! You let those bad
          guys beat up my Dad!

Unc lays on the fake charm.

                       UNC
          Naw, little man. It’s all good! Come on,
          I’ll take you to your folks!
                 (beneath-his-breath)
          ...little fucking insurance policy.

Ky doesn’t budge, his gaze narrowing on Unc suspiciously.
                                                        105.


                       KY
          You’re a bad guy too! Momma and Daddy
          fight bad guys!

Unc starts to stalk toward Ky.

                       UNC
          Nah, I’m a good guy! I was playing a
          trick on the bad guys, acting like I was
          one of them. C’mere now!

AUNTIE appears in the corridor behind Unc, moving quietly
and quickly closing the distance on him.

He doesn’t sense her at all...until she wraps him up from
behind with an expertly rendered rear-naked-choke.

                       AUNTIE
                 (whispering close)
          Wassup, ex!?

Unc goes bug-eyed, horror-panic, dropping the pelican
case as he tries to fend off Auntie...to no avail.

She addresses young Ky with the calm and collect of a
school marm as she slowly chokes Unc out.

                       AUNTIE (CONT’D)
          Now don’t you worry, baby. Old Unc here
          has been naughty and needs to take
          himself a little nap.

Ky nods his approval, watching as Unc convulses and goes
board stiff as Auntie renders him completely unconscious.

                       AUNTIE (CONT’D)
          Now Ky, can you pop into that room there
          for a skinny minute for Auntie? She needs
          to have an “adult chat” with Unc.

                       KY
          But can he hear you, Auntie?

                       AUNTIE
          Oh no baby...but he can feel me.

This sentiment seems to make   perfect sense to Ky as he
ducks into one of the rooms.   Auntie gives it a second
before she starts beating on   Unc like a birthday piñata,
punctuating her assault with   insults--

                       AUNTIE (CONT’D)
          --MOTHER--
                 (haymaker dropping)
                       (MORE)
                                                       106.

                       AUNTIE (CONT’D)
          --FUCKING--
                 (another haymaker)
          --NO LOYALTY HAVIN’!--
                 (closed fist Hulk-Smash)
          --BITCH-ASS!--
                 (multiple blows)
          --PUNK!--

KYRAH & DAVID

Reloading, in breath-for breath sync, strategizing--

                       KYRAH
          --Draw the Shadows off! I’m gonna find
          Ky! COVER!!

Kyrah races off to look for Ky as David lays down a
stream of suppressing FIRE, re-engaging his former team
in brutal back-and-forth volleys.

PELICAN CASES, overturned in the tumult, lie on the deck,
stranded between these warring factions.

David scrambles over to them and begins hurling them off
the stern of the boat and into the water.

Varjo SEES this, reacts--

                         VARJO
          --THE CASES!

                       CYSGOD
          SMOKE CHECK THAT MOTHERFUCKER!

They level their weapons on David and FIRE--

--David dashes off, heading below deck as BULLETS BLAZE--


INT. PRINCESS 30M YACHT - ELSEWHERE - CONTINUOUS

Kyrah moves through the shifting miasma of gunsmoke, her
weapon extended, on full alert-- MORITI materializes in
front of her and promptly seizes her gun wrist--

--She responds by bashing her with a hard backhand--

--Moriti is rocked but manages to release the magazine
lock, loosing the clip from her AK, which tumbles free,
engaging them in aggressive, hand-to-hand combat now--

--Kyrah drives her knee up, Moriti rolls away, ripping
the AK free from her grip. It clatters across the deck.
                                                         107.


Moriti pulls her own gun-- Kyrah lunges and meets her mid-
draw, they struggle for the gun. Kyrah kicks out her
legs, slamming her down on his back and stealing her air.

Moriti wrist-locks Kyrah's gun hand-- hauling her over
with her weight and getting a finger inside the trigger
guard, SQUEEZING--

--the pistol BUCKS and FLASHES between them-- bullets
whiz wild, muzzle flash burns sunspots, temporarily
blinding them both--

Kyrah SEES a COMBAT KNIFE on the deck floor, grabs it,
slashing out defensively--

--Moriti slips the blade’s arc, going for a fallen AK,
the clip resting right next to it.

Kyrah springs, looking to bury that knife in her spine.

Moriti kicks out a table, it clips Kyrah’s shin, claiming
her balance, she pitches, falls-- but rolls right back up
onto her feet and fires the blade like a throwing knife.

Moriti is struck right in the forehead. Center-punched.
She goes comically cross-eyed, staring at the blade,
before toppling over dead.

Kyrah scoops up a spare mag and a felled PUMP SHOTGUN and
rushes off to find Ky.


INT. BELOW DECK - CONTINUOUS

David, running, BLIND-FIRING back over his shoulder.
Varjo fills the corridor behind him, BLASTING AWAY--

--David dives into a state room as his weapon cycles to
the slide-lock-- He’s out of ammo. He drops the empty
clip and stares.

Cysgod joins Varjo.

                       CYSGOD
          Forget him! Let’s get the cases and pop
          smoke! Navy on its way!

                       VARJO
          WE KILL THEM NOW!!

David slots the empty mag and pulls the slide back with a
loud CLACK-- fooling them into thinking he’s reloaded.
                                                         108.


He holds his breath now.

Varjo hesitates a moment longer-- wants David’s blood.

                       CYSGOD
          LET’S GO!

Varjo reluctantly retreats with Cysgod.

David breathes a sigh of relief, then realizes he isn’t
alone in the room and wheels around to find Ky and Auntie
there-- with Unc gagged and tied up with curtain cable.

Ky rushes over to David, hugging his Dad tightly. David
examines his son, checking him for any injuries.

                       DAVID
          You ok, buddy?

Ky nods and David draws him back into a deep embrace.

Kyrah appears in the doorway a moment later to the sheer
relief and delight of her son.

                       KY
          MOMMA!

The trio embrace. Their little family finally reunited.

                       KYRAH
          Let’s get the hell out of here.

                       DAVID
          We let Cinder and The Shadows slip away,
          they’ll be hunting us inside six months.

Kyrah looks down at her son.

                        DAVID (CONT’D)
          And I’m not living in hiding, or in fear,
          anymore, Kyrah.
                 (beat)
          Let’s hit ‘em now and end this.
          It’s the last thing they’ll expect.
                 (beat)
          We’re the hunters now.

Kyrah deliberates this course of action for all of split-
second, then turns to Auntie, handing her the pump
shotgun she recovered.

                       KYRAH
                 (a nod to Ky)
          You got him?
                                                         109.


                       AUNTIE
                 (racking the gauge)
          Oh, y’best believe.

Kyrah leans down to Ky’s level.

                       KYRAH
          You stay with Auntie, baby. Mommy and
          Daddy have one more thing to do, ok?

                       KY
          Ok, momma.

She hugs him once more. David kisses the top of his son’s
head and together, he and Kyrah hustle down the corridor.


INT./EXT. DECKS - CONTINUOUS

CYSGOD and ANINO load the PELICAN CASES into the GO-FAST
BOAT while above, CINDER boards the EURO CHOPPER, which
is rotoring up to speed.

VARJO glasses the horizon with a pair of BINOS.

BINOCULARS P.O.V: THREE ATTACK BOATS bounding across the
water toward them at high speed.

                       VARJO
          Got a pair of Coast Guard Cutters and a
          Navy FAC inbound.

Cinder beckons Varjo into the helicopter.

                       CINDER
          Let’s get airborne, goddammit!

NEARBY

Kyrah and David creep toward the bow railing, both of
them loaded for bear now, having collected most of the
stray weaponry onboard the Princess.

They can HEAR Cinder’s voice and throw tactical hand
signals and semaphore back and forth, targeting each of
the tandems above and below--

Kyrah finger counts, 3--2--1--

--they pop from cover and OPEN FIRE without any preamble,
ambushing them. David pounding the Chopper’s position and
Kyrah blasting away on the Go-Fast Boat below--
                                                         110.


--The Shadows respond, going for their guns and touching
off a tremendous FIREFIGHT between the two factions.

Anino slams the throttle forward on the GO-FAST, pulling
away from the Princess, the mooring cables snapping free
as it speeds out into the bay.

Varjo leaps into the Chopper and gets behind the stick as
Cinder RETURNS FIRE. The chopper lifts off, following
that GO-FAST BOAT.

David and Kyrah jump into that rented Scarab and give
chase.

INT/EXT. SCARAB - CONTINUOUS

Kyrah rushes over to the controls, turns the engine over
and jams the throttle full.

They bound out into the bay, crashing through the Go-
Fast’s wake and trying to close the distance but the
bigger boat and more powerful and gradually pulling away.

                       DAVID
          We’ll never catch them in this.

Suddenly, they SEE the Go-Fast Boat and the Chopper
abruptly bank back around...

...and head straight for them.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          Ok, maybe I didn’t totally think this one
          through.

                       KYRAH
          Sounded like a good idea at the time.

                       DAVID
          Story of my life.

David brings up an ASSAULT RIFLE.

The chopper skims in right over the water, MUZZLE FLASHES
bursting from the canopy. ANINO FIRING wildly-- Bullets
splinter the Scarab’s hull as David RETURNS FIRE--

--Kyrah SEES seepage below deck, throws open the bilge
hatch, water streaming in--

--Stray rounds. Punched through the hull.
                                                         111.


                       KYRAH
          SHIT!
                 (turning to David)
          We’re hit, we’re taking on water!

Kyrah snaps back around and SEES the GO-FAST BOAT rip
past, right off their port side, CYSGOD and ANINO unload
on them, more ROUNDS puncturing the Scarab’s flimsy hull.


INT. GO-FAST BOAT - CONTINUOUS

Anino throttles back as she banks the boat around.

CYSGOD reloads and charges a HK416 Assault-Rifle with RIP
(Rapidly Invasive Projectile) semi-explosive rounds.

He moves at hyper-speed. His hands a blur as they move
over the weapons. Skills acquired in heavy combat.


INT./EXT. SCARAB POWER BOAT - CONTINUOUS

The boat pitches, fore-deck dipping, nosing further into
the water.

                       DAVID
          Find the pump!

Kyrah abandons the helm, yanking open the aft
compartments, tossing LIFE-JACKETS, looking. David does
the same but a DUAL PARA-SAILING RIG is all he finds.

The boat lags, the flooding below deck steadily dragging
the stern down and slowing its speed--

--the chopper and Go-Fast boat are a quarter mile off and
closing for another attack run.

                       KYRAH
          We’re losing too much speed!

David, thinking...a wild idea takes hold.

He hustles over to the controls, turning back toward
their pursuers. He jams a wrench into the wheel to keep
the craft straight and throws the throttle FULL.

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          Are we actually playing chicken with a Go-
          Fast boat and a fucking helicopter!?
                                                         112.


INT. EURO-COPTER - CONTINUOUS

VARJO grins, slamming the stick forward as he SEES the
Scarab below them, dead-heading their way.

CINDER preps an M-203 GRENADE-LAUNCHER and prepares to
blow that boat out of the water.


INT./EXT. SCARAB POWER BOAT - CONTINUOUS

David pulls out that dual para-sailing rig and hustles
over to the stern transom, strapping in.

                       KYRAH
          Are you kidding!?

                       DAVID
          Get over here! Hurry!

Kyrah rushes over and starts strapping into the tandem
side of the Para-sailing rig.

                       KYRAH
          Are we really doing this!?

                       DAVID
          Would you like to try something else ‘cuz
          I’m kinda outta moves here, baby!

They step up onto the stern transom now, slipping, heavy
gusts throwing their balance.

Kyrah cinches a length of ROPE to the stern cleat and
holds them fast for the moment.

The Go-Fast and Chopper are less than a half-mile off.

Suicide from any angle.

David takes up the loose para-sail, handing the other
section to Kyrah.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          Get ready. We’re throwing this straight
          up in the air and then we’re gettin’ on
          ‘em! You good?

                       KYRAH
          I’m nowhere near good but let’s go.

Kyrah glances down those TWIN MERC ENGINES under her.
                                                         113.


The boat bucks huge swells, catching air, the propeller
clearing the water.

The Chopper and Go-Fast Boat start FIRING simultaneously,
bullets chipping hull, starboard, stern--

David...waiting...waiting...waiting...THEN--

           DAVID                      KYRAH (CONT'D)
--I LOVE YOU BABY--!           --I LOVE YOU TOO--!

                       DAVID
          --NOW--

--David tosses his section skyward, Kyrah follows suit--

--the para-sail deploys, the chute unfurling, catching
the onrushing headwind and yanking them straight up in
the air like a midway-ride.

They target those TWIN MERC ENGINES beneath them, FIRING--
slugs PIERCING the steel housing and EXPLODING--

--The passing Go-Fast boat is INCINERATED as the Scarab
DETONATES-- the shockwave shattering the vessel.

Kyrah & David take aim on the chopper and FIRE-- rounds
ricocheting off the fuselage, pining axles, rotors,
hitting oil lines--

--They keep squeezing, BLASTING the cockpit canopy glass--

--a bullet scores blood splat-- the chopper dips and
rolls into a violent auto-rotation as black smoke begins
issuing from the rotor.

The bird banks hard, whirling past and narrowly missing
Kyrah and David as it bombs toward the beach below, the
black smoke now pouring from it like a chimney stack.

Kyrah & David, still aloft, slowing sinking back to earth
and landing on a sandbar just off the Island’s northern
tip.

The Chopper whirls and dips as it touches down inside a
canopy of mangrove, shredding foliage and palm fronds as
it bellies hard to the ground inside a WETLANDS RESERVE.


EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

David and Kyrah drag themselves ashore, pausing to check
their ammo.
                                                        114.


                         DAVID
          Split up?

                       KYRAH
          Flush ‘em out. I got a feeling Cinder
          survived.

                       DAVID
          I got a feeling they both did.

                       KYRAH
          What do you got?

David drops the remaining clip on his 9mm.

                         DAVID
          Two rounds.

Kyrah pops her clip...A single piece of brass inside.

                         KYRAH
          One bullet.

David re-racks the weapon.

                       DAVID
          Well make that shit count.

Kyrah nods, contemplates something, then asks:

                       KYRAH
          You think I should get the extra?

                       DAVID
          The extra what?

                       KYRAH
          Bullet. You’ve got two.

                       DAVID
          That’s not “extra”...that’s mine. Why
          would I give you one my bullets?

                       KYRAH
          You know, just--

                         DAVID
          --just what?

                       MIKE LOWREY
          --Just, I’ve-- y’know...I just feel like
          I’m, right now...I could be, a better
          shot than you--? Maybe--
                       (MORE)
                                                         115.

                       MIKE LOWREY (CONT'D)
                 (quickly, like it’ll help)
          --baby?

                       DAVID
          Don’t baby me...

David jacks the slide, loosing an airborne bullet from
the chamber. Kyrah catches it.

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          ...just don’t miss.

Kyrah grins, then turns and jogs up the beach. David
into the cluster of mangrove and toward the palls of
smoke pouring from the downed chopper.


EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY

A large, expensive WEDDING in progress. The BRIDE and
GROOM stare lovingly into one another’s eyes as everyone
ooh’s and ahh’s the traditional “Couple’s Dance”...

...right up until the moment a bloodied and blackened,
JACK CINDER, shouldering that M-203 GRENADE LAUNCHER,
spills onto the dance floor, scattering wedding guests,
who scramble for cover as he FIRES A BURST into the air--

--Tables upend. Champagne bottles fly and pricey floral
arrangements are shredded by the flash panic of a full
blown human stampede.

The PRIEST plows right into the wedding cake in full
flight and winds up wearing most of the top layer,
including the plastic topper, as he flees the scene.

The D.J., headphones on, oblivious the commotion erupting
around him, continues spinning, his head down.


EXT. BEACH/WETLANDS PRESERVE - CONTINUOUS

We INTERCUT between David and Kyrah as they advance
separately.

KYRAH

She HEARS the GUNSHOTS in the distance and races toward
the hotel.

DAVID

He arrives at the smoking chopper and finds it empty.
                                                         116.


A bullet-punched cockpit. Blood on the pilot’s seat.
Trampled foliage leading away...David follows the trail.


EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

The D.J. finishes plattering an LP with a big grin on his
face...a grin that dissolves as soon as he SEES Cinder,
staring back and him and holding a smoking assault-rifle.

                       CINDER
          Reception’s over.

DAVID

Moving steadily through the wetlands, SEES blood on the
passing branches, enters a clearing--

--A stray round whizzes right past, the sub-sonic snap of
a bullet-by crackling right by his left ear.

His earbud SQUELCHES, he hauls it free as it buzzes and
whines--

--MORE GUNFIRE pounds in. David sprawls prone.

He rolls to cover and rears up, only to feel the massive
shadow of VARJO fall over him like a lunar eclipse.

David spins back with his gun, Varjo blocks it. David
grabs the AR-15 Varjo is armed with, the two grapple for
control. David manages to disengage the mag, then rack
the action, rendering the weapon useless for the moment.

Varjo rag-dolls David into a Mangrove tree, pinning him.

                       VARJO
          Ohhhh, you got an old testament beatdown
          coming to you, son!

Varjo ROARS this locomotive-like war-cry in David’s face
as he FIRES a right hand right at his head. David slips
the blow and counters with a one-two combo, which has the
affect of a garden hose against granite.


EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY

The D.J., his trembling hands raised, rushes off.

Cinder, his back turned, doesn’t SEE Kyrah stalking up
behind him, gun extended...
                                                         117.


                       KYRAH
          ...give us a little pirouette now. Hands
          high. Ride’s over. Leavenworth awaits.

Cinder turns to confront his former flame, still armed
with that M-203, its barrel pointed at the ground.

                       KYRAH (CONT’D)
          Drop it.

                       CINDER
                 (with a wistful sigh)
          Just how did we get here, hun?

                       KYRAH
          Well, you being a highly motivated
          homicidal maniac probably had a lot to do
          with it...just off the top of my head.

                       CINDER
                 (almost wistful)
          The top of your head...
                 (ugly/vindictive/mean)
          ...What I wouldn’t give to watch it being
          torn off, right about now.

Kyrah closes on him, tightening her aim.

                       KYRAH
          I wouldn’t be talkin’ any type’a shit
          about “heads getting torn off” if I was
          you right now, Jack!

Cinder grins back blood, then, without another thought,
simply squeezes the M-203’s secondary trigger--

--THE GRENADE LAUNCHER--

--Kyrah goes wide-eyed, diving for cover as a 40mm ROUND
ricochets off the dance floor and DETONATES the
bride/groom table, sending a paroxysm of debris flying.

DAVID AND VARJO

Varjo wades in, clenched fists the size of cantaloupes as
he bombs away on David’s mid-section with body shots.

David absorbs the percussive punches, covers and throws a
hatchet-style uppercut that catches Varjo flush in the
nuts and ‘knock-knees’ him-- sending him stumbling back.
                                                         118.


KYRAH AND CINDER

Kyrah lifts her head, dazed, as Cinder emerges out of the
blast smoke, ambushing her, slashing and moving, punches
landing so fast that Kyrah is still processing the fact
that she’s being hit.

She staggers to her feet, throwing a brutal elbow which
Cinder avoids, countering with a spinning backfist that
catches her in the sternum and steals her air.

DAVID AND VARJO

Varjo recovers and rolls his massive shoulders as he
tears the rest of his shirt away. David stands, squares,
then removes his remaining earbud, plunging him into that
extra-sensory aural state. He closes his eyes.

Varjo grins mean.

                       VARJO
          I hope you getting right with God right
          about now, motherfucker...‘Cuz he about
          to call you home, bitch.

KYRAH AND CINDER

Cinder is starting to get the better of Kyrah. Too fast.
Too strong. Too angry.

She’s starting to gas out.

DAVID AND VARJO

Varjo rushes David. David evades him, moving with
measured ease and peppering Varjo with punches.

Varjo attempts to defend himself but David is simply too
fast now. Too precise. Varjo is gassing out. David begins
landing huge shots, finishing Varjo with a front kick
that knocks him flat on his ass.

He spits blood, pulling a THAI PARANG MACHETE from the
sheath lashed across his leg.

                       VARJO (CONT’D)
          You wanted this before...
                 (aiming the blade at David)
          ...Now you’re gonna get the good end.

Varjo rises, spinning the blade effortlessly as he walks
David down. David remains rooted to the spot, watching,
waiting. Varjo rushes him, gripping that Machete like a
Bushido Blade and bringing it crashing down--
                                                        119.


--David deflects its arc, deftly throwing a vicious knee
right into Varjo’s chin before spinning the Machete
inside his grip and redirecting it right into his throat,
shish-kebob’ing him...

...Varjo stumbles, geysering blood, spinning around like
a little kid who’s lost his parents in the supermarket.

He then falters, shuffle steps and timbers like a Redwood
Tree...dead.

David scoops up his 9mm and Varjo’s AR-15, lashing it
across his back as he sprints off toward the hotel.


EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - MOMENT LATER

Someone’s Worst Wedding Day...Ruined rental furniture
everywhere. FIRES raging near the blast-blackened buffet.
Shrouds of pitch black smoke drifting over everything.

David is facing the other way, searching for Kyrah, when
she appears out of the pall of smoke, with Cinder
standing behind, her own 9mm pressed flush to her head.

David senses them and turns back slowly, his weapon, with
its lone bullet, locked in his grip.

Cinder is taunting him. Kyrah is screaming something...

...but David can’t hear either...His earbuds remain out,
his “Super-Power” still fully functioning...or so he
thinks...until he aims that gun, trying to target Cinder--

--And Cinder responds by squeezing his forearm even
tighter and constricting Kyrah’s air as he hauls her in
closer, cheek-to-cheek, jamming that gun into her face...

...and now David realizes that whatever he has to do...he
has to do it in real time.

He plugs the earbuds back in. SOUND crashes in like a
wave. He starts to sweat and shake, his breath picking up
steadily, anxiously and beginning to betray him.

That same sickening fear he felt in the bank, spreads
through him like poison as he watches Cinder hover just
behind Kyrah, these reptilian eyes fixed on him...

                       CINDER
          ...I couldn’t kill your son...but this is
          so much better and more, appropriate. And
          it’s important you see it...and HEAR it.
                                                         120.


Then, as if unnoticed or somehow unheard before...this
music becomes suddenly, almost magically prominent...

...these familiar chords, playing from the abandoned D.J.
station and over the outdoor sound system...

...a song intended for the “Couple’s Dance”...

...a Lionel Richie song...

...THEIR FUCKING LIONEL RICHIE SONG:

“TRULY”
David and Kyrah utter, to themselves, at the exact same
moment...
           KYRAH                          DAVID
...I don’t believe it...      ...I don’t believe it...

They lock eyes now...and then, as though they’d rehearsed
this a thousand times before, begin serenading one
another, picking up the lyrics, mid-song...

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          ...let me hold yooooouuuu...I need to
          have you, near meeeeee....

Cinder, both confused and perplexed, not expecting this--

                       CINDER
          --What the fuck is this?

They just sing louder, ignoring Cinder altogether...Kyrah
quietly intuiting what David is thinking now...and gently
nodding her consent...

                       DAVID & KYRAH
          ...and I feel with yoooouuuu, in my
          heart...

...something comes over David: A sureness and a certainly
and a confidence that he hasn’t experienced without being
deaf to the world around him...

                       DAVID & KYRAH (CONT’D)
          ...this love will last, forever...

...this release that allows him to bring that 9mm up in
one motion, smooth and steady and perfectly still...and
put its single bullet right into Kyrah’s shoulder--

--BAM!
                                                         121.


--the wound sprays Cinder with her blood and blinds him
temporarily--

--just as the song crescendos--

                       DAVID
          --BECAUSE I’M TRUUUUUUUULLLLLYYYYY--

--Kyrah wrenches free, spooling away from Cinder’s grasp
and pulling her gun from his grip--

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          --TRUUUULLLY IN LOVE WITH YOU GIRL--

--Kyrah FIRES both bullets into Cinder point blank,
spinning him around like a top...

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          ...I’M TRUUUUUUUULLLLLYYYYY...

...David brings that AR-15 around off his back, draws
down and CUTS LOOSE on Cinder, closing the distance--

--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT---

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          --HEAD OVER HEELS, WITH YOUR LOVE...

...Cinder is blasted apart in almost balletic fashion.
David keeps marauding forward, FIRING AWAY--

                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          --I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEED YOOOOOUUUU...

...Cinder comes crashing down dead in the outdoor pool,
disappearing from sight as David reaches Kyrah and wraps
her up his arms, holding her as tightly as he ever has as
Lionel takes over the song’s final chorus...

...David and Kryah, completely lost in one another now...

          ...you know you’re alright...to,

The couple kiss for a long, long time as WE DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BEACH SHACK - SOMEWHERE IN THE CARIBBEAN - DAY

White sand, the consistency of baby powder, stretches
unblemished for miles and miles in either direction.

Ky, chasing and fleeing the waves while bashing a new
pair of action figures off of one another...happy and
carefree and everything a five year kid should be.

Kyrah, looking renewed and refreshed and healed, watches
her son from a beach-front hammock. She’s on a SAT-PHONE.

                       KYRAH
          ...so that’s a wrap on your stint as a
          “Government Contractor”?

WE INTERCUT WITH:


INT. PARKING LOT - DAY

AUNTIE, looking chopped-to-death in a DOLCE PANTSUIT.

                       AUNTIE
          Yup. With Unc spending the rest of his
          bitch-ass life in prison, I’m back on the
          market. Professionally, personally.

Kyrah laughs, does a little catcall.

                       AUNTIE (CONT’D)
          And the fallout from Cinder going down
          has created all kinds of opportunities.

                       KYRAH
          Why do I get the feeling that you’re
          calling me from Langley.

Auntie enters the main lobby of the CIA, grinning.

                       AUNTIE
          Women’s intuition?

                       KYRAH
          And whatever will you be doing for them?

Auntie with a deliberately dramatic beat...

                       AUNTIE
          ...Shadow Force 2.0...Only doing it right
          this time.

Kyrah chuffs. Somehow she knew this was coming.
                                                      123.


                       AUNTIE (CONT’D)
          You interested?

                       KYRAH
          Only in sunshine and sea breezes at the
          moment.

                       AUNTIE
          Paradise is overrated, baby. Everything
          becomes stale bread after awhile.

                       KYRAH
          Then let’s talk after awhile...Be good,
          Auntie.

                       AUNTIE
          You too, girl. Love.

Kyrah clicks off.


INT. CIA LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Auntie stows her phone and WE PAN WITH HER TO REVEAL:
PARKER. He smiles and shakes her hand as they proceed
through a SECURITY CHECKPOINT together and WE RETURN TO:


EXT. BEACH - DAY

David emerges from the shack, looking lean and muscled as
he joins Kyrah in the hammock, lying his head in her lap.

                       DAVID
          What do you want to do about dinner?

She wraps herself around him.

                       KYRAH
          Didn’t I hear something about spear-
          fishing?

                       DAVID
          Yeah but I wouldn’t count on that
          actually producing a fish, to consume.

                       KYRAH
          I can make shrimp tacos.

                       DAVID
                 (calling out to Ky)
          Ky! You want Shrimp tacos?

Ky nods like a bobble as they watch him play in the surf.
                                                         124.


                       DAVID (CONT’D)
          I think I might make myself a mojito, you
          want one.

                       KYRAH
          Can’t.

David, still lying on her lap, eyes closed.

                       DAVID
          Can’t?

Kyrah smiles as she gently places her hands on his
head...and then begins softly drumming out...

...beat-beat, beat-beat, beat-beat...

David registers this-- and then realizes what it means--

--his eyes snap open as he shoots up, spinning around.

A pregnant pause between them...then Kryah softly utters:

                       KYRAH
          Yes.

He gathers her up in his arms, exulting, hugging her
harder than he can ever remember hugging her.

                       DAVID
          Really!?

                       KYRAH
                 (grinning, kissing him)
          Really.

                       DAVID
          Ky! Get over here son! Momma and daddy
          have some news for you!

Ky bounds up from the beach toward his parents as WE
SLOWLY RISE UP OVER THE SCENE, up past the swaying palm
trees, soaring away into cloudless sky above...

...our little family is finally together...

...and at peace.
