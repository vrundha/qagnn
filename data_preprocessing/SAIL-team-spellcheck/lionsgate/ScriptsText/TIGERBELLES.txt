FADE IN:
EXT. WILMA’S YARD - RURAL TENNESSEE - DAY (1947)
YOUNG WILMA RUDOLPH (aka “Skeeter”), 7, and her older sister
YOUNG CHARLENE, 12, playfully collect laundry hanging on a
line. In the background is the Rudolph family home... large,
but slightly dilapidated wooden house/farm in the midst of
the swath of green land.
                     YOUNG WILMA
           Betcha can’t beat me back!
Charlene waves her off and continues gathering clothes.
                     YOUNG CHARLENE
           You got them little legs.
                     YOUNG WILMA
           I’m still faster than you.
A shirt that Wilma’s collecting skims the ground.
                     YOUNG CHARLENE
           Skeeter, you better pick them clean
           clothes up off the ground! Mama’ll
           kill you!
As Wilma gathers the clothes in her arms, Charlene gets a
mischievous glint in her eyes.
                     YOUNG CHARLENE (CONT’D)
           Mark... set... GO!
Charlene takes off running with a basket full of laundry.
Wilma chases after her, laughing the whole way. Despite her
small size, she’s amazingly quick.
Suddenly, Wilma STUMBLES and falls directly into a muddy
pile. The clean laundry’s filthy. Charlene sprints back.
                     YOUNG CHARLENE (CONT’D)
           Mama’s gonna lick you good.
She tries to help Wilma up, but her legs are rubbery.
                     YOUNG CHARLENE (CONT’D)
           C’mon, Skeeter. Stand up.
                     YOUNG WILMA
           I’m trying to.
                     YOUNG CHARLENE
               (growing concerned)
           C’mon, Wilma, this ain’t funny.
                                                                2.

Wilma looks to her big sister, then down to her immobile
legs. Her little brow furrows with worry.
                    YOUNG CHARLENE (CONT’D)
          Mama! Mama!
EXT. US ROUTE 79 / INT. OLDSMOBILE - MOMENTS LATER
A rust-caked OLDSMOBILE speeds erratically along a country
road dotted with LIVESTOCK and BLACK SHARECROPPERS working
the fields. BLANCHE RUDOLPH, late 30s, grasps the wheel
tightly as she drives. Charlene sways with each jerky turn of
the car. Wilma lays stiff-as-a-board across her lap.
EXT. MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE - LATER
The Oldsmobile SCREECHES to a halt in front of the hospital.
                    YOUNG WILMA
          Mama, am I gonna be okay?
                    BLANCHE
          Skeeter, you gon’ be back out there
          running with your brothers and
          sisters in no time. A doctor’s
          gonna fix you up like new.
Wilma’s not so convinced. Blanche isn’t really either, so
Charlene takes a stab.
                    YOUNG CHARLENE
          And guess what? He’s gonna be
          Colored just like you.
Wilma raises her eyebrows in disbelief. Blanche takes Wilma’s
chin in her hand, Wilma’s eyes towards hers.
                    BLANCHE
          You my little fighter, you know
          that? Scarlet Fever? Beat it.
          Double-pneumonia? Beat it. And you
          gon’ beat this too. You know why?
                    YOUNG WILMA
          Why?
                    BLANCHE
          Cause you’re a Rudolph. That’s what
          we do.
Charlene curls Wilma’s hand into a FIGHTING FIST. She wraps
her own hand around it. Sisters in this fight together.
                                                     CUT TO:
WILMA’S MIND’S EYE: A SERIES of STYLIZED SHOTS, the SOUND
FADING IN AND OUT.
                                                                3.

INT. MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE - DAY
- Wilma’s on a cold metal table. A BLACK DOCTOR and NURSE fit
METAL BRACES on her legs. She winces in pain.
-SLAM! The heavy lid of the IRON LUNG MACHINE is shut down on
Wilma’s small body. She finds herself in DARKNESS.
-SNAP! The BLACK DOCTOR fastens the rigid BRACES below Young
Wilma’s knobby knees. She forces a clumsy step.
- Charlene and Blanche look through a window as a NURSE
exercises Wilma’s legs in a shallow pool.
EXT. WILMA’S YARD - RURAL TENNESSEE - MORNING
Wilma sits in a makeshift wagon while Charlene massages her
legs. Blanche oversees the FAMILY construction of a homemade
polio contraption.
Wilma grits through a tiresome, clunky walk along the
PARALLEL BARS. She glances up seeing a group of KIDS at the
end of the road staring with confusion. Wilma stops and
Blanche sees the gossiping Kids. She redirects Wilma’s
attention to focus on the task at hand. Charlene matches
Wilma step-for-step, while the whole FAMILY cheers her on at
the end of the bars... an official finish line.
EXT. WILMA’S YARD - RURAL TENNESSEE - DAY
Wilma toys with her cumbersome brace as she stares out at her
Brothers and Sisters playing basketball on the homemade dirt
court. Her eyes hone in on their youthful and agile legs
scurrying on the court.
EXT. WILMA’S YARD - RURAL TENNESSEE - DUSK
Wilma’s Family walks toward their house in the distance.
Charlene and Wilma remain in the distance at the parallel
bars. Blanche yells out from the PORCH.
                    BLANCHE
          Wilma! Charlene! Supper time!
                    YOUNG CHARLENE
          Just a few more minutes, Mama!
Wilma stares at the BRACES on her legs. Mind racing.
                    YOUNG WILMA
          Take ‘em off, Charlene.
                    YOUNG CHARLENE
          You not ready yet. And Mama’ll be
          mad as all get out.
                                                                4.

                    YOUNG WILMA
          Mama said I can beat whatever comes
          my way. Take ‘em off.
Hesitant, Charlene unstraps the BRACES. They hit the ground
with a heavy THUD. Wilma, unsteady, wills her legs to move.
Her face is full of pure grit and determination. She
stumbles, Charlene moves to steady her. Trying again, Wilma
takes a few wobbly steps before falling on her face.
This time, she holds up her hand to stop Charlene. She pulls
herself back to her feet, takes a shaky step, and then
another, and then another. Charlene breaks into a proud and
awe-filled grin.
ANGLE ON: The BRACES, sitting like discarded shells in the
dirt, as Wilma’s LEGS gain strength and speed in the
background.
                                              MATCH CUT TO:
INT. WILMA’S HOUSE - DAY (1958)
CLOSE ON: The BRACES sit dusty on a closet shelf, as we pull
back to reveal WILMA, 18, pretty but serious with eyes mature
beyond her years. Overwhelmed, she balances her daughter,
YOLANDA, 1, on her hips while tossing items in a suitcase.
Wilma’s FAMILY OF 21 KIDS bustle about, helping her pack. ED
RUDOLPH, 50s, dressed in a PORTER’S UNIFORM, breezes by.
                    ED RUDOLPH
          Now don’t forget your coat, girl!
                    WILMA
          I won’t, Daddy.
CHARLENE, 23, a no frills woman, hands Wilma a PHOTOGRAPH.
                    CHARLENE
          Here it go.
INSERT PICTURE: Wilma doting a newborn Yolanda with kisses.
Wilma smiles and makes funny faces at Yolanda who manages a
little smile in return.
                    WILMA
          You gonna miss mama? Mama’s gonna
          miss you.
Guilt wafts over her face. Charlene doesn’t miss this.
                                                                5.

                    CHARLENE
          Don’t go letting out no more tears.
          You done cried two rivers worth and
          it ain’t changing the fact that you
          gotta go.
Yolanda starts to whimper. Wilma sniffs her diaper. She puts
her on the bed and starts to change her.
                    WILMA
          Leaving y’all to carry the load
          while I’m at school... it don’t
          feel right, Charlene.
                    CHARLENE
          You act like you finna go living
          high and party with stars. College
          ain’t no vacation. You gon’ be
          working on your education and we
          all gonna work on raising Yolanda.
                    WILMA
          It still don’t feel right.
                    CHARLENE
          Neither does cleaning white folks’
          houses.
As Charlene crosses the room to trash the dirty diaper, Wilma
glances back at the BRACES in the closet. She goes still.
                    WILMA
          What if I can’t keep up with the
          other girls?
                    CHARLENE
          You the fastest person I done ever
          saw, Skeeter.
                    WILMA
          Not faster than Jesse. I can’t
          outrun cars.
                    CHARLENE
          I bet if we put you next to Mama’s
          car you’d be.
                    WILMA
          That’s only cause it’s raggedy.
They chuckle as Charlene gives her a hug. She gives Wilma a
long look.
                    CHARLENE
          Skeeter, you got a window of
          opportunity.

                                                                6.

                    CHARLENE (CONT'D)
          Don’t try to find a way to pull
          down the shade. You gotta show your
          shine.
                    ED RUDOLPH (O.S.)
          Robert’s here!
Wilma carefully puts the PHOTOGRAPH of her and Yolanda in her
suitcase. Charlene grabs some bags and follows Wilma through
the hustle and bustle of the house.
EXT. WILMA’S HOUSE - PORCH - SAME TIME
ROBERT ELDRIDGE, 18, a handsome, sweet-natured country boy
gets out of a battered farm PICKUP TRUCK. Wilma’s YOUNGER
SIBLINGS flock to him. He happily gives them attention. He
gives a courtesy nod to Ed and Blanche Rudolph.
                    ROBERT
          Afternoon, Ma’am... Sir.
                    ED RUDOLPH
          Hey there, Robert.
Robert skirts through the playful Kids, eyes only on Wilma.
                     CHARLENE
              (playful)
          And you don’t see me standing over
          here, huh?
                    ROBERT
              (good heartedly)
          Good Lord, Charlene. Gimme a
          chance, wouldya?
She laughs as Robert finally makes his way in front of Wilma,
heavily smitten. He tickles Yolanda in Wilma’s arms.
                    ROBERT (CONT’D)
          Hey, Skeeter.
He gives her a tender kiss on the cheek.
                    BLANCHE
          Alright, enough of that there.
                    ROBERT
          I’m being good, Mrs. Rudolph.
                    BLANCHE
          You better be.
Yolanda squeals as Robert continues to tickle her.
                    BLANCHE (CONT’D)
          One baby is enough, don’t you say?
                                                                7.

                    WILMA
          Mama.
Blanche purses her lips, standing by her statement. Avoiding
this conversation, Robert grabs Wilma’s suitcases and loads
them into the truck.
Ed Rudolph hands Wilma an ENVELOPE. Wilma looks inside to
find a small STACK OF CASH.
                    WILMA (CONT’D)
          Daddy, no. I can’t take this.
                    ED RUDOLPH
          Naw, now. Everybody pitched in
          where they could. The lil’ ones
          even picked corn on Johnson’s farm.
                    BLANCHE
          And I sold my washing machine.
                    WILMA
          Mama! No, get it back. You saved up
          to get that machine.
                    BLANCHE
          We gonna make do over here,
          Skeeter. That running scholarship
          the school giving you ain’t gon’
          cover everything.
                    ED RUDOLPH
          Now you be careful down there in
          Nashville. Mind Coach Temple and
          your manners. And don’t be sassing
          no white folks.
Wilma hugs her Family. She holds Yolanda tightly in her arms.
                    WILMA
          Be a good girl now.
She fights letting the tears in her eyes fall, but she can’t
stop the outpouring. Robert and Charlene look to one another,
each sympathetically watching this goodbye. Wilma hands
Yolanda off to Charlene before climbing in Robert’s truck.
Her Family waves goodbye as Robert’s truck pulls away,
leaving her world behind. He flips on the radio. The
Drifter’s “There Goes My Baby” comes on.
EXT. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH, CAPITOL HILL (NASHVILLE) - DAY
This is the quintessential Southern Black Church. COACH ED
TEMPLE, 38, opens the station wagon trunk revealing several
BOOKS in BOXES. Ed’s stoic both in stature and attitude
until...
                                                                8.

he looks into the rearview mirror meeting eyes with C.B.
TEMPLE, 36, who playfully winks at him while putting on
lipstick. She’s the honey to Ed’s vinegar.
                    COACH TEMPLE
              (teasing)
          I think you got enough of that gunk
          on, don’t you?
                    C.B.
          A lady’s presentation is always a
          direct representation of her man.
C.B. looks in the side mirror and adjusts her hat. Perfect.
                    C.B. (CONT’D)
          And I’d say that the world thinks
          you’re pretty put together.
Ed chuckles and grabs one of the boxes from the back of the
trunk. She gets out and he takes in her beauty.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          If the ladies who taught me how to
          read looked like you, I wouldn’t be
          able to spell ‘go.’ Folks are gonna
          be looking more at you than at that
          chalkboard.
                    C.B.
          I think they’ll manage just fine.
C.B. gives him a kiss. In the background, a FRUMPY WOMAN
overloaded with bags struggles with the church door.
                    C.B. (CONT’D)
              (to the Frumpy Woman)
          Hold on, Sister! Here I come!
As C.B. climbs the stairs to help the Frumpy Woman, a HEFTY
MAN with wrinkled clothes, hustles to get the door for C.B.
She turns back to Ed with an “I told you so” smirk. He smiles
to himself as he hauls the box inside.
EXT. DOWNTOWN NASHVILLE - DAY
Robert’s truck makes its way through downtown. Well-dressed
MEN and WOMEN make their way in-and-out of stores. Wilma
takes it all in.
WILMA’S POV: A perfectly made-up BLACK MOTHER and DAUGHTER
stand beneath a department store sign that reads COLORED
ENTRANCE. It’s the city, but it’s still the Jim Crow South.
                                                                9.

INT. ROBERT’S PICKUP TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
Wilma anxiously taps her foot. Robert sees she’s nervous and
sweetly reaches over and takes her hand as the truck pulls
past a sign that reads: TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - SAME TIME
CLOSE ON: A pair of large, masculine BLACK HANDS pours chalk
into a CHALK LINER MACHINE.
CLOSE ON: An imperceptibly CROOKED CHALKLINE is rubbed out by
a MAN’S FOOT, then replaced. A perfectionist.
CLOSE ON: A WHISTLE, CLIPBOARD, STOPWATCH, NOTEPAD full of
notes, and a SCALE are unpacked from a crate.
CAMERA TILTS UP to reveal Ed appraising his immaculate
contributions to an otherwise unkempt track. This is the
place where Ed is ALL vinegar. He grimaces as he eyes the
partially completed track: it’s missing the last two turns
leaves it in the shape of a U.
As Robert’s pickup truck drives past, Ed locks eyes with
Wilma in the front seat. Wilma offers a shy wave. Ed sternly
acknowledges her with a tight nod.
Ed’s attention drifts across the yard... MARVIN JOHNSON, 38,
the men’s football and track coach, oversees a THREE-MAN
GROUNDS CREW carefully attending to Men’s Field. Ed, with
zero help, goes back to pushing his chalk liner.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - CAMPUS - SAME TIME
Robert’s truck winds through campus. Smartly put together
BLACK STUDENTS walk along the paved paths. Some STUDENTS
converse on the grass. Other Kids electrify with laughter at
tables in the QUAD. A few GUYS toss a football back and
forth.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - HALE HALL - SAME TIME
Handsome brick buildings surround a well-manicured courtyard.
Wilma and Robert park next to a Lincoln sedan.
AT THE LINCOLN
A cute, well-coiffed and full-figured student, BARBARA JONES,
18, is surrounded by a dozen leather suitcases. Her HEN-
PECKING MOTHER, late 40s, and DOTING FATHER, late 40s, buzz
around her. As Barbara starts to pick up a heavy box...
                    BARBARA'S FATHER
          Let me get that for you, baby.
          Young women shouldn't be doing
          heavy lifting.
                                                                10.

He scans the yard and notices a group of MALE COLLEGE
STUDENTS. Among them is the suave and preppy kid, WENDELL,
19, causally leaning against a car checking out the Freshmen.
                    BARBARA'S FATHER (CONT’D)
          Hey! You boys wanna make a couple
          of bucks?
He takes a billfold from his pocket and the Boys hurry over
to pick up the mountain of luggage. Barbara catches Wendell’s
attention. He shoots a flirty grin. She happily reciprocates.
AT ROBERT’S PICKUP TRUCK
Wilma has been watching all of this.
                    WILMA
          Must be nice.
Robert playfully flexes a bit.
                    ROBERT
          Them lil’ boys? You got all the
          muscle you need right here.
With a wink, he takes Wilma’s suitcase from her. Suddenly, a
BLARE of R&B music approaches.
A shiny black CADILLAC pulls up beside Wilma. A leggy, red-
headed vixen climbs out. This is BILLIE WHITE, 21, grown as
she wanna be and a tad intimidating. The OLDER-LOOKING MAN in
the Cadillac pulls off. All heads turn as Billie struts past
the Freshmen.
                    BILLIE
          What? Never seen a senior before?
Wilma gets a kick out of that. She turns to Robert.
                    WILMA
          I ain’t never seen that type of
          woman before.
INT. HALE HALL - WILMA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Lugging a suitcase, Robert walks in the room to see Wilma
tentatively unpacking a bag. Wilma can’t help but to peek
over at Barbara and her family across the room.
Barbara's Father organizes the desk while Barbara’s Mother
places an ornate bedspread on the bed. Barbara’s not doing a
thing... other than checking her makeup in the mirror. Robert
and Wilma exchange a glance: This girl is spoiled.
                    BARBARA’S MOTHER
          ...now the sorority usually takes a
          line early spring.
                    (MORE)
                                                                11.

                    BARBARA’S MOTHER (CONT'D)
          You’re legacy, so you have one foot
          in the door, but you still need to
          do your part.
Wilma’s bag accidentally falls to the floor sending the
PHOTOGRAPH of her and Yolanda across the floor. Barbara
finally moves from her throne and beats Wilma to the picture.
                    BARBARA
          Who’s this?
Polite, Wilma swiftly takes the photo from Barbara.
                    WILMA
          That’s my sister’s daughter.
                    BARBARA
          Well, aren’t you a good auntie? Mu--
Wilma jumps in to change the subject.
                    WILMA
          Looks like we're roommates. I'm...
                    ELEANOR (O.S.)
          Wilma?
A bookish, intelligent looking upperclassman, ELEANOR
WILLIAMS, 22, calls from the doorway. She checks names off
her clipboard.
                    WILMA
          Yes, but you can call me Skeeter.
Barbara’s Parents give each other a side-eye over the
nickname. Eleanor merely continues her checklist.
                    ELEANOR
          And... you must be Barbara.
                    BARBARA
          Yes, and you are...
                    ELEANOR
          Eleanor. Coach Temple wants you on
          the track at four p.m. sharp.
                    WILMA
          Today? I haven't even unpacked yet.
Eleanor finally looks up from her clipboard.
                    ELEANOR
          Wilma, you’re here on a
          scholarship, right?
                                                                12.

                    WILMA
          Yes.
                    ELEANOR
          Then you’re on Coach’s time now.
                    BARBARA
              (to herself)
          I’m not on scholarship.
Eleanor gives Barbara and her Family a solid once over.
                    ELEANOR
          I suggest neither of you be late.
Eleanor walks away. Wilma turns to Barbara who resumes
primping in the mirror.
                    WILMA
          You run track?
                    BARBARA'S FATHER
          Oh, BJ runs alright. You are
          looking at the fastest young lady
          in the whole state of Illinois.
Barbara gives Wilma a brazen smirk. Competition is on.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - CAMPUS - AFTERNOON
Wilma, in a long baggy T-shirt and frumpy shorts, jogs
slowly. Next to her is Barbara in a polished, form-fitting
track uniform with CHICAGO scrawled across the chest.
They run through campus, passing STUDENTS on the TENNIS
COURTS and DRUM MAJORS practicing their signature moves.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - SAME TIME
Wilma and Barbara, competitors at the core, glance at each
other then start jogging faster and faster until finally they
are full-on RACING each other. They arrive at the track
breathless just as...
Ed BLOWS his WHISTLE. A DOZEN ATHLETES surround him,
including Billie and Eleanor.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Welcome to your first Tigerbelles
          practice. I'm Ed Temple. You can
          call me ‘Coach.’
Ed’s manner is precise and no-nonsense.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
              (motioning to Eleanor)
          This is Eleanor Williams.
                    (MORE)
                                                       13.

                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          She’s my assistant coach and a
          graduate student here. She’s also
          your teammate, but you’re expected
          to treat her with respect of a
          coach.
Ed takes in Barbara’s uniform, non-approving.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          You may’ve been hot stuff where you
          came from, but none of that matters
          here. You are all at the same
          starting line.
Barbara subconsciously fidgets with her uniform.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          There are no secured spots on this
          team. If you’ve been offered a
          scholarship, don’t mistake that for
          easy sailing.
Wilma shuffles nervously.
                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          You’re expected to be at every
          practice early. If you’re showing
          up as my whistle blows, you’re
          late. We might all be Colored, but
          my watch doesn’t run on C-P time.
              (then)
          Tigerbelles do not slack off on
          their school work. Remember you are
          using track in exchange for an
          education. I expect y’all to
          maintain at least a three-point-
          five G.P.A. Curfew is nine p.m.
Billie guffaws out loud, then stifles it. Ed scowls,
pointedly looking at Billie.
                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Athletics open up doors for you,
          but education keeps them open.
              (then)
          Tigerbelles should look presentable
          at all times. You are ladies first,
          students second, and athletes
          third. I expect for you to be foxes
          not oxes.
Wilma and Barbara glance at one another.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          You all represent this university,
          but more specifically you represent
          me. Is all of that clear?
                                                                14.

Wilma, Barbara, and the rest of the FRESHMAN RUNNERS stand
shocked, overwhelmed. Billie feigns a yawn behind Ed’s back.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Alright. Line up for weigh in.
Wilma whispers to Barbara.
                    WILMA
          Scales? Is he serious?
                    BARBARA
          I'm not getting on a scale.
Ed brings out a SCALE. Eleanor lines everyone up.
                                                    CUT TO:
BILLIE, who jumps on and jumps off. No problem. Ed looks down
the line.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Miss Jones, you're next.
                    BARBARA
          I was taught ladies never reveal
          their age or their weight.
Ed, barely looking up from his notepad, motions with his pen
for Barbara to get on the scale.
                    BARBARA (CONT’D)
          I've always watched my waistline.
          Is this really necessary?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          We need to get those hips in runner
          shape. This isn't a cotillion. Get
          on the scale.
Ed inspects the number, raises an eyebrow.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          You're one cookie away.
              (down the line)
          Miss Rudolph.
Hesitant, Wilma steps on the scale. Ed squints in
concentration.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Stand up straight.
He adjusts Wilma’s posture. Ed reads the scale and takes
Wilma in for the first time.
                                                                15.

                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Looks like you’ve put on some
          weight since recruitment last year.
                    WILMA
          I... I know. I'm gonna lose it.
Wilma shrinks back into the Team. Ed CHIRPS his whistle.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          My runners need to be in top shape.
          If you wanna keep your scholarship,
          you’re gonna need to put in work.
                    BARBARA
              (under her breath)
          I’m not on scholarship.
Eleanor and Billie are in earshot; they roll their eyes.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Alright. Today’s warmup will also
          be the first cut.
Wilma and Barbara’s jaws drop.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Get on the track and loosen up your
          legs with two miles. Anyone over
          fifteen minutes... thank you for
          coming out, but this will be your
          first and last practice.
The GIRLS begin running on Ed’s whistle. Each Girl has a
unique running style. Billie’s stride is nonchalant, but
powerful. Eleanor’s steady and calculated. Barbara’s gait is
showy and slick. Wilma’s long legs make her look as though
she is gliding on ice. Billie leads the pack with Wilma doing
her best to keep pace with her.
INT. JANE E. ELLIOTT CAFETERIA - DAY
STUDENTS scramble about. SORORITY GIRLS (AKAs) wear pink
sweaters and talk loudly at a table. Barbara eyes them
longingly as she and Eleanor push their trays through the
line. Then her eyes widen as she watches Billie loading up
her tray.
                    BARBARA
          Billie, aren't you scared of
          putting on weight?
                    BILLIE
          Nah. All the practicing makes it
          slide right off. Just wait.
                                                                16.

Billie inhales a big bite of cake. Barbara checks out the
desserts. She chooses a few.
                    ELEANOR
          I'd take Billie's advice with a
          grain of salt if I were you. She
          gets plenty of exercise outside of
          practice, if you know what I mean.
She does. She reluctantly puts back only one of her desserts.
AT THE TABLE
Wilma scans the cafeteria and spies Billie, Barbara, and
Eleanor. Intimidated, she walks towards them.
                    WILMA
          Is it okay if I sit here?
                    BILLIE
              (aloofly gestures to sit)
          It’s not a Woolworth’s lunch
          counter, so go on ‘head.
There’s an awkward silence. Wilma breaks it.
                    WILMA
          I saw you in that Cadillac. Is that
          man your boyfriend?
                    BILLIE
              (laughs)
          Jimmy's lead sled caught your eye,
          huh? Naw, he's just a friend. I'm
          not really the ‘boyfriend’ type. A
          lot of girls come here to get their
          M.R.S. Degree. That’s not my style.
                    WILMA
          M.R.S. degree?
                     BILLIE
          You a real country gal, aren’t you?
              (then)
          They're here to find themselves a
          husband, you know... a man who can
          keep ‘em spoiled like their daddy.
Everyone instinctively looks at Barbara who doesn’t seem to
notice. There’s another awkward beat. These four women may be
teammates, but they have absolutely nothing in common.
                    ELEANOR
          Alright ladies, so after dinner,
          you should get back to your rooms
          so you can get to bed. Practice is
          bright and early tomor--
                                                        17.

                     BILLIE
           --Ease up, Granny. Here I am still
           sweating from practice today and
           you're already talking about
           practice tomorrow.
                     WILMA
           Is Coach Temple always this strict?
           ELEANOR                         BILLIE
   (emphatic)                      (rolling her eyes)
YES!                            YES!
                     ELEANOR
           So please don’t make a habit of
           breaking curfew like Billie.
                     BILLIE
           Eleanor tells Coach everything.
                     ELEANOR
           It’s my job.
                     BILLIE
           Yeah, but you ain’t gotta like it
           so much.
                     BARBARA
           Coach’s got more rules than with my
           mama and daddy.
                     WILMA
           If his rules help me keep my
           scholarship, I’ll follow ‘em.
                     ELEANOR
           What’s your major?
                     WILMA
           Elementary education.
                     BARBARA
           Hope you make teaching more
           exciting than this conversation.
           College is supposed to be fun.
                     WILMA
           Running is fun.
                     ELEANOR
           It has to be more than fun. It has
           to be your life. No distractions.
           Just school and track.
 Billie winks at a BOY staring at her from afar.
                                                                18.

                    BILLIE
          There’s always room for a little
          bit more.
Eleanor purses her lips.
                    ELEANOR
          Rhonda got ‘a little bit more’ last
          year and you see what that got her.
                    WILMA
          Who’s Rhonda?
                    BILLIE
          She ain’t nobody now.
                    WILMA
          What happened to her?
                    BILLIE
          She got knocked up and Coach threw
          her off the team.
Shit. Fear washes over Wilma’s face.
                    BILLIE (CONT’D)
          He sent her packing right back to
          whatever country hill she came
          from. We ain’t seen her since.
                    BARBARA
          He didn’t have to do all that.
                    ELEANOR
          His track, his rules. No mothers on
          the field. Kids are the ultimate
          distraction.
Barely breathing, Wilma forces a nod. Just then, Wendell
walks in with confidence. He stands in the middle of the
cafeteria and gives a distinctive ALPHA FRAT CALL with gusto.
                    WENDELL
          ROLL CALL! A-PHI-A!
A table full of ALPHA PHI ALPHA BROTHERS stand up. They’re
smartly dressed in Frat regalia of the times: Button downs,
trousers, oxfords, some wear bow ties.
                     ALPHA FRAT BROTHERS
          A-PHI-A!
A RIVAL FRAT GUY responds with another chant.
                    RIVAL FRAT GUY
          PHI BE-TA SiiiIII-GMA!
                                                                19.

                     WENDELL
          A-PHI-A!
                    RIVAL FRAT GUY/SIGMA BROTHERS
          Brothers! I said my brothers!
          (Yeah)/This house (this house)/Is
          full (is full)/Of blue and white/I
          said this house (this house)/Is
          full (is full)/Of Blue and White!
In response, Wendell and the Alphas chant.
                    WENDELL/ALPHA BROTHERS
          A-Phi-A, A-Phi-A./The Phi Beta
          Sigmas got some soul!/A-Phi-A, A-
          Phi-A/But they just can't compare
          with the black and gold!
They begin to STEP. The rhythm of their steps fills the
cafeteria. Then the rival Sigma Frat jumps in to battle.
Suddenly, AKA sorority start their signature ladylike moves.
Not to be outdone, ZETA PHI BETA Sorority begins to battle.
It's a magical moment. Our Tigerbelles watch in awe. Barbara,
in particular, is intrigued. She catches the eye of Wendell.
The STEPPING and CHANTS continue over:
MONTAGE - THE FIRST WEEKS OF SCHOOL:
INT. HALE HALL - WILMA’S ROOM - DAY
An ALARM CLOCK goes off. Wilma groggily looks over at the
other bed. Barbara’s asleep with an eye mask, pink rollers,
and a scarf over her hair. Wilma quietly slides out of bed.
INT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - CLASSROOM - DAY
Wilma in Math class, studiously taking notes.
                    PROFESSOR
          If you'll turn to page three of the
          reader that's being handed out...
The STUDENT ahead of her, sporting a TSU FOOTBALL shirt,
turns to hand her the readers. This is JESSE, 20. Wilma
almost gasps at how good looking he is.
                    JESSE
          Here you go.
Wilma takes a reader and smiles shyly. Jesse can’t help but
to take a look back over his shoulder.
INT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - LIBRARY - DAY
A stern LIBRARIAN walks Wilma through her campus job.
                                                                20.

                    LIBRARIAN
          To maintain your scholarship,
          you’ll work fifteen hours a week
          shelving books.
The Librarian wheels out MOUNDS OF BOOKS. Wilma sighs.
                    WILMA
          Yes, ma’am.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - CAMPUS - DAY
Wilma leaves the library, making her way across campus. She
sees a group of NURSING STUDENTS pass by. Then, TWO THEATER
STUDENTS recite Shakespeare. Wilma smiles to herself; being
at college is a dream come true.
END MONTAGE
INT. HALE HALL - PHONE BOOTH - AFTERNOON
Barbara’s already dressed in her practice gear. She’s propped
up next to the dorm PHONE BOOTH. Wilma comes in the lobby.
                    BARBARA
              (on the phone)
          There she is now.
              (off phone)
          Wilma! It’s your boyfriend.
Barbara sticks the phone in Wilma’s hand with a mischievous
glint in her eye.
                    BARBARA (CONT’D)
          See you at practice. Don’t be late.
Barbara hurries off. Wilma stares at the phone, torn.
                                             INTERCUT WITH:
EXT. CLARKSVILLE STREETS - PHONE BOOTH - SAME TIME
A FOR COLORED ONLY sign is firmly tacked to the phone booth.
Robert toys with the cord, subtly clocking looks from the
WHITE BYSTANDERS passing by.
                      WILMA
          Robert?
Robert brightens when he hears Wilma’s voice.
                      ROBERT
          Hey, you.
                    WILMA
          I’ve gotta go to practice. You give
          my mama the money?

                    ROBERT
          Yeah, but she said she don’t want
          you sending no more. I swear that
          woman woulda cut me if it she ain’t
          have to answer to the Lord.
                    WILMA
          Mama’s all bark.
                    ROBERT
          She know how to bite too.
Facts. Wilma chuckles.
                    ROBERT (CONT’D)
          I just got a quick question.
                    WILMA
          Yeah?
                    ROBERT
          What you got on right now?
                    WILMA
          Robert! You crazy.
              (lowers her voice)
          I’m gonna be naked in a minute.
                    ROBERT
          Now that’s what I’m talking about.
                    WILMA
          No, really. I gotta go change. I’ll
          try you later, okay?
                    ROBERT
          Alright, I--
She hangs up and takes off running. Robert’s left listening
to the dull DIAL TONE, a little overlooked.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - LATER
It’s 5:58. Ed taps his watch suggestively as Wilma runs up,
just in the nick of time. He blows his whistle.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Three lines, girls. Eleanor, run
          ‘em through the warm up.
Eleanor leads them through exercises: high knees, butt kicks,
lunges. Wilma and Barbara focus on each other, competing even
in the warm-up.
                                                TIME CUT TO:
                                                                22.

Wilma’s feet dig into the starting blocks. Sweat pours from
her face. Barbara and Billie flank her on each side. BANG!
They take off. Suddenly, Ed emphatically waves his arms and
BLOWS his whistle bringing the Girls to a halt.
Ed marches to Wilma and positions her back to the blocks.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          You’re not doing a hard post on
          your take off.
Wilma’s confused. She looks to Barbara and Billie. They don’t
have a damn clue what he’s talking about either.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Get in your starting stance.
Ed stands in front of her inspecting her heel-to-toe
relationship. Her feet are shoulder width apart.
                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Now post up to me to assemble the
          hard post.
Ed holds his arms out in front of Wilma, bracing for impact.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Run into my hands like you’re
          taking off.
She does. His hands halt her shoulders mid-stride.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Hold the stance.
One of Wilma’s legs stays up, holding her hard post position.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Feel your body in that line? That
          there’s a triple extension. You
          gotta hold that hard post.
              (to the Tigerbelles)
          Your position needs to be
          perpendicular to the ground at a 90
          degree angle.
Eleanor takes copious notes. As Wilma strains to hold the
position, her butt sticks out causing her stance to falter.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          You’re broken at the waist.
              (to the Tigerbelles)
          Breaking at the waist gives you
          what we call a bubble butt. You
          don’t want that.
                                                                23.

                    BILLIE
          Mine ain’t never hurt me.
Billie laughs and tries to give Eleanor a hand-slide, but
Eleanor shushes her.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          This ain’t about body type, Billie.
          It’s about posture.
Ed motions for Barbara to hold her hard post position. He
nods his approval. Points to Billie. She nails it.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Always remember that if don’t get
          out of those blocks right, you
          cannot win. It doesn’t matter how
          fast you think you are. You’ll only
          end up being the fastest second
          place. Got it?
                    WILMA
          Yes, Coach.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          And you’re lopsided. Favoring one
          leg. It’s breaking your stride.
Wilma lowers her gaze, feeling a little picked on.
                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Follow me.
              (beat)
          You have an injury you haven’t told
          me about?
                    WILMA
          Nothing you don’t know about, sir.
Wilma catches Barbara, Eleanor, and Billie watching.
                    WILMA (CONT’D)
              (low)
          Just the polio when I was kid.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Well, it looks like you’re still
          carrying it. Come here.
Ed digs around in his crate of EQUIPMENT. He pulls out an
ANKLE WEIGHT and straps it onto Wilma’s left ankle. He snakes
the strap around Wilma’s shoulder blades into a figure 8 and
then loops it under her armpits. He tightens the strap and
she immediately stands up straighter, but is self-conscious.
                                                               24.

                    WILMA
          My braces came off over 10 years
          ago. The doctors said I was good.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          And they did a good job teaching
          you to walk. But I’m gonna teach
          you to run. Until you straighten
          out, you’ll need to wear this 24-7.
He motions for her to head back to the track. Wilma tightens
her face to hide embarrassment. Eleanor takes notice of
Wilma’s dismay with Ed’s solution.
                    WILMA
          How’m I supposed to run in this?
                    ELEANOR
          Trust me: Trust him.
WHISTLE BLOWS! Wilma starts to run, clearly slowed by the
contraption. Ed watches her in the back of the pack.
INT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - GIRLS’ LOCKER ROOM - LATER
Billie, Eleanor, and Barbara peel off her sweaty track
attire. Wilma shleps in, the dispiritedness still present.
                    BARBARA
          I can eat a whole poundcake by
          myself after today.
                    ELEANOR
          Keep on and you really will have a
          bubble butt.
In her underwear, Barbara monitors her svelte figure.
Everything is taut and in place. Wilma turns away and tucks
herself into a corner to hide her body. With her back to the
Girls, she takes off her top. A C-SECTION SCAR is present on
her stomach. She quickly slides on a shirt to hide it.
                    ELEANOR (CONT’D)
          Coach won’t hesitate to cut you if
          you get too big, Barbara.
Wilma glances at her own image in the broken mirror.
                    WILMA
          He has to know that life happens
          though, right? Folks can’t be
          perfect all the time.
                    BILLIE
          Coach be wanting perfection like we
          Jesus walking on water... knowing
          damn well we all gonna drown.
                                                           25.

                    BARBARA
              (looking in the mirror)
          My body weight is perfect.
Barbara playfully shows off, giving dramatic face poses.
                    BILLIE
          That’s cause all your weight is in
          that big head of yours. Swear it
          blows up more every damn day.
                    BARBARA
          Being confident doesn’t mean you’re
          conceited. There’s a line.
                    BILLIE
          You musta crossed that line long
          before you came here. Shit, I know
          Wilma is tortured on the daily
          living with you.
                    BARBARA
          I’m not stuck up.
No one nods in agreement. Billie turns to Wilma.
                    BILLIE
          Am I right or am I wrong?
                    WILMA
          I-I don’t know. BJ, I mean you can--
                    BARBARA
          --Don’t let Billie get you into a
          discussion you can’t handle.
Wilma goes quiet to keep the peace.
                    BILLIE
          Wilma, you grown. Don’t let Barbara
          scare you. She all talk.
                    BARBARA
          More like all beauty.
                    ELEANOR
          Beauty doesn’t break the tape. If
          people have time to comment on how
          beautiful you are, then you’re not
          running fast enough.
                    BARBARA
              (offended)
          What about you? You take down every
          word Coach says like it’s gospel
          and you still can’t outrun me.
                                                                26.

The gauntlet is thrown.
                      BILLIE
          Oh, shit.
To save face, Eleanor fires back.
                    ELEANOR
          Billie, I bested you in the 400, so
          I wouldn’t get on a high horse.
          Half the time you do too much
          drinking to even climb one.
Barbara chuckles causing Billie to one-up Eleanor.
                    BILLIE
          Wilma got a late start and still
          got past you like you a crawling
          baby. I guess that stick up your
          ass must’ve slowed you down.
Barbara sucks her teeth and scans Eleanor, reading her.
                    BARBARA
          Age before beauty. Humph.
Eleanor turns to Wilma who cuts her eyes to the ground. It’s
best to be Switzerland. Stay neutral. Irritated, Eleanor
grabs her things and heads for the door.
                    ELEANOR
              (over her shoulder)
          We’ll see who’s crawling after
          Coach makes cuts.
Icy, Billie and Barbara leave in opposite directions. Wilma
takes a deep breath, alone without a team.
INT. WILMA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
The Rudolph Family gathers around the kitchen table.
Makeshift decorations adorn the kitchen coupled with a
handwritten HAPPY BIRTHDAY SIGN. A group of LITTLE GIRLS dote
over Yolanda.
Wilma’s glued to the stack of school books crowding the
kitchen table. She subconsciously fidgets with the brace
contraption on her body. Robert slides a slice of untouched
birthday cake closer to Wilma, but she doesn’t notice.
                    CHARLENE
          College done made you too good for
          my cake now? Don't be getting all
          uppity on us.
                                                              27.

                    WILMA
          I'm tryna lose weight. Coach Temple
          says we can't have sweets before a
          track meet.
                    ROBERT
          Temple's Ten Commandments.
                    WILMA
          Robert.
                    ROBERT
          Way I see it, his rules should stay
          down at the campus. They shouldn’t
          be in your home life.
                    WILMA
          I don’t get to punch out of being
          an athlete when practice ends. It
          don’t work like that.
                    ROBERT
          You can’t punch out of your family
          either. You don’t even know how to
          make your own decisions.
This stings.
                    WILMA
          Just cause you don’t like my
          decisions, don’t mean I ain’t the
          one making ‘em.
                    CHARLENE
          Alright, y’all cut out that
          bickering. We got presents to open.
Yolanda GIGGLES as she holds onto the table, trying to take
her first steps.
                    CHARLENE (CONT’D)
          Look at the birthday girl over
          there trying to strut.
                    WILMA
          She standing up now?
                    ROBERT
          Her first step can’t be far off.
                    WILMA
              (dejected)
          I guess Imma miss that too.
Charlene saddles up next to Wilma trying to bring hope.
                                                               28.

                    CHARLENE
          Me and Yolanda gon’ come spend a
          weekend in the dorms with you. You
          can get in more time with her.
                    WILMA
          So Barbara can tell Coach and get
          me kicked off the team? Naw.
                    CHARLENE
          She won’t do that, Skeeter. She’s
          your teammate.
                    WILMA
          She’s competition not a teammate.
          They all made that clear.
                    CHARLENE
          That’s fear talking.
                     WILMA
          No, that’s Barbara talking. She
          don’t miss a day telling me how she
          deserved the scholarship I got.
              (beat)
          Barbara can’t find out about
          Yolanda. None of ‘em can.
Robert and Charlene turn to one another, unsure of how to
soothe Wilma. Charlene pushes the cake closer to Wilma.
                    CHARLENE
          One bite can’t hurt. I promise I
          won’t tell.
Charlene looks for backup from Robert, who looks on, almost
testing. Wilma sits there longingly looking at her cake. She
takes a big bite, closing her eyes in satisfaction. Robert
kisses her gently on the cheek as an apology.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - DAY
The Tigerbelles gather with noticeably fewer girls in
attendance. Ed beckons them closer.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Our meet is in two weeks. It’s our
          only meet this season. ‘Til now,
          the girls that couldn’t cut it have
          been taking themselves out. But
          today is the day I skim the cream.
Proven correct, Eleanor self-righteously raises her brows to
Billie, Barbara, and Wilma. Wilma stiffly stands wearing the
brace contraption, hoping this is all worth it. The
Tigerbelles all look at one another. Who’s it gonna be?
                                                                29.

MONTAGE - SKIMMING THE PACK:
Ed BLOWS the whistle and the Girls run. He takes notes. As
Eleanor takes off with urgency...
A CLUNKY RUNNER
...takes to the track, but her stride has no cadence and she
weaves in between the lines. Ed motions for her to leave the
track. Saddened, she does.
Ed lines the Girls up for another run. Barbara digs deep as
she hustles around the track.
A STIFF RUNNER
...makes the turn on the track with her upper body rigid. Ed
blows the whistle and points for her to leave. Down goes
another runner.
The Girls line up for another run. Billie passes the others
with ease, looking like a winner.
A HEEL-HIKER
...can’t avoid over-striding. It makes her foot land too far
in front of her knee. Ed adjust his glasses. He waves his
hand for her to stop running. She let’s the tears flow.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - LATER
Another run. Wilma’s fingers press into the track, awaiting
Ed’s whistle. Ed BLOWS it and they’re off. He immediately
notices Wilma’s posture is off.
                    COACH TEMPLE
              (mumbling to himself)
          Damnit. Just listen.
This faux-pas puts Billie in the lead. Barbara and Eleanor
are close behind. Wilma kicks into another gear to catch up.
Ed zeros in her, and only her.
-- WILMA’S LEGS running, her FEET STRIKING the track.
-- Ed is one with his STOPWATCH. His eyes widens as he looks
between his stopwatch and Wilma.
-- Wilma breathes rhythmically, running in stride. She passes
Eleanor and closes in on Barbara with cheetah like speed.
-- Ed stops staring at the stopwatch. Seeing something
special, the whistle drops from his mouth.
-- WILMA’S ARMS PUMPING. Her face suddenly contorts into a
strained look. She’s flies by Barbara.
                                                               30.

Billie crosses the finish line with Wilma only inches behind
her. Wilma almost caught up, but failed. Ed shakes his head
in frustration.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Best second place!
Wilma’s frustrated with herself as Ed addresses the Girls.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          If you’re still on this field, make
          sure you’re ready to run at the
          Tuskegee meet.
The remaining Girls on the track congratulate each other.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Miss Rudolph, come to my office.
INT. TSU - COACH TEMPLE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Ed’s makeshift office is nothing more than a desk in the
middle of an equipment storage shed. Wilma follows Ed.
                    WILMA
          Sir, I know what you’re gonna say.
          I was awful out there.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Your biggest mistake today was that
          you thought you knew better than
          me. I already told you. Bad posture
          cannot win.
Wilma tugs at the brace.
                    WILMA
          I woulda caught Billie if I ain’t
          have this on. It slows me down.
              (finally)
          This thing makes me feel like I’m a
          dang cripple.
                     COACH TEMPLE
          It’s your broken spirit that’s
          slowing you down. Your past doesn’t
          have to be a cinderblock. It
          doesn’t have to define you. You
          need to work to move past it.
              (beat)
          Did you know you were on pace for a
          record-setting run with the brace?
Her surprised look portrays a resounding no.
                                                                31.

                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          And I think if you would’ve held
          your hard post, you would’ve taken
          it. You have something really
          special. Something only a few
          runners in a lifetime possess. I
          can help you uncover it, but you
          need to listen. To trust me.
              (beat)
          And you must make Tigerbelles your
          priority. You’re running anchor at
          the Tuskegee meet.
                    WILMA
          Really?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Now go on, Skeeter. Get showered. e
Wilma’s thrown off. Did he just call her “Skeeter?”
                    WILMA
          You never called me that before.
                     COACH TEMPLE
          You weren’t officially my runner
          before. Now don’t think this means
          you get to call me ‘Ed’ though.
              (beat)
          Go change out.
INT. TSU - JUST OUTSIDE COACH TEMPLE'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
Wilma scans the area, she’s alone. She pumps her fist in the
air and lets out a SHRIEK of joy.
INT. TSU - COACH TEMPLE’S OFFICE - SAME TIME
Ed can’t help but to smile as the excited SOUNDS of WILMA’S
SHRIEKING comes into his office. As the sounds die out, Ed’s
eyes fall on an OLD BOX sitting behind his desk. His worried
look shows that this box haunts him.
He slowly approaches the box. He exhales as he opens it. It’s
full of NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, MEDAL RIBBONS, and OLD RACE
NUMBER RUNNING BIBS. He rifles through each item.
INSERT: A headline reads: MARVIN JOHNSON, TENNESSEE STATE
UNIVERSITY TRACK AND FOOTBALL STAR SWEEPS HBCU NATIONALS.
Ed scans the write up.
INSERT: ED’S NAME is toward the bottom. He’s listed as an
ALSO RAN. The PHOTO shows Marvin Johnson crossing the finish
line with Ed far off in the background, forgotten.
Ed slams the box shut, unsettled by those memories.
                                                                32.

EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - LATER
Ed walks toward the infield where COACH MARVIN JOHNSON, 38,
YELLS from the sidelines at the FOOTBALL TEAM. Dressed in his
pristine TSU sweatsuit, it’s clear his BMOC (Big Man on
Campus) status never died.
But Ed has his gaze and step locked in on the man chit
chatting with Marvin Johnson... Tennessee State University’s
President, WALTER DAVIS, 60. Just as Ed is about to speak to
Davis... CLACK!!! Both Ed and Davis’ attention is drawn to
the clashing of shoulder pads from the massive HIT on the
field. Jesse (Wilma’s classmate) has made the impressive
tackle. Marvin proudly looks on.
                    MARVIN
          Know you not used to it, but that’s
          the sound of winning, Temple.
He nudges Ed in fun and belts out an annoying laugh. Jesus,
Ed can’t stand this guy and we can see why. He tries to be
the bigger man.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Team’s looking good, Marvin.
                    MARVIN
          I think this is our year.
Ed moves closer to Walter.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Walter, a word?
Davis tries to contain his irritation. Ed has a history of
pestering him. They move away from Marvin.
                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          Sure, Ed. What is it?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Well, you know I’m taking the
          Tigerbelles to the HBCU national
          meet next week.
                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          Yes, I’m sure that’ll be, uh, very
          exciting time.
                     COACH TEMPLE
          It will once we win it.
              (beat)
          I’m hoping that success will help
          you consider me for something more
          prominent with the university.
                                                                33.

                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          And what would that prominence be?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          The men’s track coach position.
                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          Marvin’s already our men’s coach.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          I know, but Marvin’s never brought
          you a title. I can do that with
          these girls.
Ed has Davis’ ear; he adds to his pitch.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          And when I do, it’s worth thinking
          about a restructure. If I could get
          my hands on the men’s team, I could
          really make a mark for the school.
Davis considers it and dangles a carrot.
                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          Let’s see what you can do in
          Tuskegee first and then we’ll talk.
Ed nods. A potential victory on its way.
EXT. OUTSIDE NASHVILLE / INT. ROBERT’S PICKUP TRUCK - MORNING
The early morning light kisses the horizon. Charlene holds
Yolanda in her arms. She and Wilma are squeezed together as
Robert drives to campus. Wilma anxiously taps her feet.
                    WILMA
          Is this as fast as you can go?
                    ROBERT
          Just a few more miles, Skeeter.
          I’ll get you there in time.
                    WILMA
          Coach is gonna be mad. This is the
          most important day of our season.
          If I don’t get this right, nothing
          else matters.
Robert abruptly HITS his brakes. Traffic has backed up ahead
of them. Robert cranes his heads out his window to see what’s
going on. POLICE LIGHTS FLASH ahead.
                    CHARLENE
          What’s going on?
                                                                34.

                    ROBERT
          Looks like a hog truck overturned.
                    WILMA
          I can’t wait.
                    CHARLENE
          You gon’ have to.
Like hell. Wilma’s grabs her overnight bag. She gives Yolanda
a very quick kiss and leaps out.
                     CHARLENE (CONT’D)
          Hold on!
Wilma doesn’t even look back to see Yolanda reaching out for
her. Charlene lets out a heavy laden sigh.
EXT. ROAD - SAME TIME
The campus of Tennessee State University sits in the
distance. Wilma runs through the HOGS and TRAFFIC towards it.
EXT. HALE HALL - SAME TIME
Ed and the Tigerbelles wait in a van. All of the RUNNERS are
there, except for one. Billie slumps in her seat wearing
sunglasses. Very hung over.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Where's Skeeter? I told my sister-
          in-law we’d be there before it gets
          dark. We need to be on the road in
          ten minutes!
Frowning, Billie slightly lowers her sunglasses.
                    BILLIE
          Well, yelling ain’t gonna make her
          up and appear.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          I’ve told y’all a thousand times if
          you're not early, you're late. I...
As Ed continues to rant, WILMA DARTS into the van.

                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Where in God’s tarnation have you--

                    WILMA
          --The roads got blocked. I had to
          run the rest of the way.
                                                               35.


Eager, Barbara nudges Billie, waiting on Ed to erupt. Their
eyes dart between the two, anticipating. Ed takes in Wilma
profusely sweating and still winded.

                    COACH TEMPLE
          Well... alright. Let’s go. Get here
          ahead of time in the future. No
          more of this fastest second place,
          you hear?

                      WILMA
          Yes, sir.

Slightly pissed, Barbara mouths, “What the hell?” to Billie
as Ed slams the van door shut.
EXT. TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - DAY
A BANNER reads: 1958 HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND
UNIVERSITIES TRACK MEET. Our Tigerbelles arrive, turning the
heads of their opponents. They’re definitely in the “foxes”
category. Barbara stops walking, looking unimpressed.
                    BARBARA
          There's no bleachers. Where are my
          fans supposed to sit?
                    BILLIE
          Fans? Girl, please. You better be
          glad we get a damn baton.
HONKS blare out. Barbara's Parents jump out of their Lincoln
with Family and Friends. Their SIGNS and fervent waves feign
celebrity status. She beams, playing the part.
Barbara throws an “I told you so” look to Billie.
                      CHARLENE (O.S.)
          Skeeter!
Wilma turns to see her entire Family has also made the trip.
Robert uses Yolanda’s little hand to wave at Wilma.
                     BILLIE
          Look who gotta a man with a built
          in family.
                    WILMA
          Robert’s a play uncle. That’s my
          sister’s baby.

                    BILLIE
          As fine as he is, you better make
          sure you ain’t next.
                                                                36.

Billie looks to Eleanor for backup, but she’s wandered off to
a STOIC and PROPER COUPLE. They give a tight and polite wave
to Eleanor. These devout church goers are Eleanor’s parents.
                    WILMA
          I’ll be back for warmups.
As Wilma runs over to her family, Billie can’t help but to
notice she has no family in attendance. Her eyes dart from
Barbara, to Eleanor, and finally to Wilma. All surrounded by
their blood. Billie quickly refocuses her attention the
ALABAMA STATE TRACK ASSISTANT COACH who’s smiling at her.
Billie switches toward the young coach. Meanwhile, Wilma
gathers with her family.
                    WILMA (CONT’D)
          What y’all doing here?
Charlene points to Barbara’s Family fawning over Barbara
doing her best poses. They’re celebrating absolutely nothing.
                    CHARLENE
          That... but much better.
                    WILMA
          Mama, you supposed to be at work.
                    BLANCHE
          I told Mrs. Roberts I’d come in
          tomorrow. Wasn’t no way I was
          missing my college girl’s big day!
Wilma takes in her Family staring at her... expectations
high. She takes a deep breath.
Ed spots President Davis in the CROWD making small talk. Ed
gets serious, feeling stakes of his own.
MONTAGE - TUSKEGEE TRACK MEET:
ATHLETES from Tuskegee University, Alabama State, Prairie
View A&M, and Florida A&M mill about.
-- Line up for the 100. Wilma and Barbara get in the blocks.
Wilma fidgets. The RUNNER next to her gives a tough gaze.
                    TUSKEGEE RUNNER
          Shoulda spent more time training
          and less on your hair.
The GUN FIRES! Wilma wins easily. Barbara struggles for
SECOND PLACE. She looks to her family, downcast.
-- Line up for the 200: Barbara, Billie, and Wilma walk to
their lanes and shake out their muscles. Eleanor looks at the
Tigerbelles and then at Ed. He’s glowering.
                                                                37.

                    ELEANOR
              (clapping)
          Girls, get set! Run strong! This is
          our race!
The Starter FIRES his pistol. Wilma’s got a bubble butt.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          No bubble, Skeeter! Longer strides,
          Billie! Barbara, focus! Eleanor,
          pick it up!
-- The race ends with Billie placing first, Wilma second, and
Barbara narrowly securing third. Eleanor closes in fourth. Ed
glances up at President Davis, who claps, very pleased.
-- The 4x100 relay: The Tigerbelles huddle.
                    ELEANOR
          Okay, the Tuskegee lead off is fast
          off the blocks, so nail the first
          twenty steps. If she only does
          fifteen--
                    BARBARA
          --Lord, everything’s not a math
          lesson. Hell, just run.
                    ELEANOR
          There’s a method for a reason. Now,
          Billie, if--
                    BILLIE
          --I got this, Old Lady.
The team disbands to take their places around the track.
Billie lines up next to the Tuskegee Runner who was throwing
shade in warm-ups.
                    BILLIE (CONT’D)
          Let’s see what your hair looks like
          when I whoop your ass.
BANG! Billie takes off with spring in her step and passes the
baton to Eleanor. Eleanor runs hard then passes perfectly to
Barbara. Barbara catches her Family CHEERING from the corner
of her eye and turns on the gas. The handoff with Barbara and
Wilma is not clean! Ed cringes at this error, but Wilma
easily cruises with her long strides. She takes FIRST PLACE!
                    BILLIE (CONT’D)
          That's how it’s done! Everybody
          better get hep!
Each of the Tigerbelles celebrate separately with their
families and clicks. To his dismay, Ed witnesses this.
President Davis CLAPS with fervor and beckons Ed over.
                                                             38.

                     PRESIDENT DAVIS
           Strong end to your season, Ed.
                     COACH TEMPLE
           Thank you. So, does that mean...?
                     PRESIDENT DAVIS
           Like I said, Marvin’s already our
           men’s coach. I’m not in the habit
           of fixing things that aren’t
           broken. Again, good job today.
Davis walks off leaving Ed angsty. He turns to see Billie
doing a victory dance as the Girls finally reconvene to
celebrate together. They boast loudly around Billie.
                     COACH TEMPLE
               (angrily, sternly)
           Billie!
Billie stops. The other Girls quiet down. The smiles drain
from their faces.
                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
           That was not a performance to
           celebrate. Not from any of you.
           Your times were off.
                     WILMA
           But Coach, we won--
                     COACH TEMPLE
           --You beat the competition, but you
           did not win. Winners challenge
           themselves. Winners give their best
           performance. Can any of you say you
           did that today?
There’s some truth in his words no matter how harsh.
                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
           Today wasn’t good enough. It’s not
           something to be proud of.
                     BILLIE
               (under her breath)
           Congratulations to you too.
Her sarcasm wasn’t quiet low enough because Ed spins back.
                     COACH TEMPLE
           Get back on the track!
          BARBARA                        BILLIE

                    ELEANOR
          Really, sir? Is this necessary?
Undeterred, Ed points at the track. In disbelief, they obey.
The FANS suddenly stop their chatter. The other TEAMS whisper
to one another. Barbara, Eleanor, and Wilma look at their
Families... each family gut-wrenched. Humiliated and with
shame on their faces, the Tigerbelles start to run.
EXT. MAISIE’S HOME - NIGHT
A small, neat home belonging to Ed’s sister-in-law, Maisie.
INT. MAISIE’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
Wilma, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor have made beds on the
couch and pallets on the floor with a variety of mismatched
pillows and blankets.
Eleanor pores over a SPORTS ILLUSTRATED MAGAZINE and
studiously jots down notes. LEGGY FEMALE ATHLETES are on the
cover. Billie notes this.
                    BILLIE
          Burning the midnight oil on your
          studies, huh? Anatomy lesson?
Eleanor ignores her and continues reading.
                    BARBARA
          I cannot believe he made us do
          punishment laps in front of
          everybody. I’m not down with this
          shaming folks stuff.
                    BILLIE
          He tells us to be foxes, but he
          treats us like dogs.
                    ELEANOR
          Coach has his reasons.
                    BILLIE
          Eleanor, do you ever think anything
          he does is wrong? Did you see him
          turn water into wine? Cause if he
          did do that, he sho’ forgot to
          share it with us.
                    ELEANOR
          I believe you had your share of
          ‘water’ last night.
                    BARBARA
          Well, I’m not gonna let Coach
          Killjoy keep me from celebrating.
                                                              40.

Barbara pulls out a hat box and gently removes the lid to
reveal... a perfectly baked PIE. All of their eyes bulge.
                    BARBARA (CONT’D)
          Mama and Daddy brought it for me.
                    WILMA
              (smiles playfully)
          You mean for us?

The Girls dig in, inhaling each bite with pure exultation.
Wilma lets out a joyful moan.

                    BILLIE
          Don’t you need to save them sounds
          for Robert?

Wilma gasps and Eleanor metaphorically clutches her pearls.
Barbara doubles over laughing.

                    BARBARA
          You wrong for that, Billie.

                    BILLIE
          Truth ain’t never hurt nobody.
          Ain’t he’s Skeeter’s boyfriend?

                    ELEANOR
          And future husband I take it?

                     BILLIE
          Stop rushing folks to the alter.
          Why somebody would wanna be locked
          down and married at this age is
          beyond me.

                    WILMA
          I love Robert. I’ve loved him since
          we were lil’ bitty kids.

Barbara takes another bite, all ears.

                     WILMA (CONT'D)
          He was my best friend. Truth was he
          was my only friend back then. He
          stuck up for me when other kids
          used to pick on me.
              (beat)
          But I don’t think I’m ready to be
          his wife. Not just yet.

           Good! You got a whole lifetime to
           be some man’s wife, but you only
           got this lil’ time now to be
           yourself.

Wilma takes in Billie’s words.

                     BILLIE (CONT’D)
           Explore your options... cause I’m
           sure as hell gonna explore mine.

The Girls laugh and give each other hand-slides.
INT. MAISIE’S HOME - DEN - SAME TIME
Ed holds the rotary phone in his hand as he cradles the
handset. MAISIE, 30, gestures toward the phone with a wave.
                     COACH TEMPLE
               (on the phone)
           ...Your sister says hello.
                                               INTERCUT WITH:
INT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
C.B., in a pretty nightgown, finishes wrapping her hair in a
satin scarf.
                     C.B.
           Tell Maisie I miss her.
                     COACH TEMPLE
               (to Maisie)
           C.B. sends her love. And Maisie,
           thanks again for letting me and my
           team sleep here.
                     MAISIE
           After what they did out there
           today, it’s all my pleasure, Ed.
           Have a good night.
C.B. motions to The Temple children walking down the hallway.
EDWINA, 6, and LLOYD, 4, come in and kiss her goodnight. She
holds the phone toward them.
                     C.B.
           It’s your Daddy.
           EDWINA                        LLOYD
Hey, Daddy!!! I miss you!     Daddy!!! When are coming
                              home?!
A moment of relief graces Ed’s face.
                                                               42.

                     COACH TEMPLE
           I miss y’all too.
                     C.B.
           They will be all yours come
           tomorrow evening.
                      COACH TEMPLE
           I’ll be there. We should be back no
           later than noon.
               (beat)
           You nervous about your meeting?
                     C.B.
           I’m fine. It’s the men of the
           church who get nervous every time a
           woman takes the lead on anything.
                     COACH TEMPLE
           You do know how to strike fear.
She laughs. He somehow knows just how to make her do that.
                     C.B.
           Long as you know to stay in line.
                     COACH TEMPLE
           Always, baby.
Edwina and Lloyd start playing around. Time to shut it down.
                     C.B.
               (to the Kids)
           Say ‘Goodnight.’
           EDWINA                         LLOYD
Goodnight! Love you, Daddy!    Goodnight! Love you!
                     C.B.
           Now go on and get to bed. Love you.
C.B. makes sure Edwina and Lloyd have gone down the hallway.
Their door SLAMS. C.B. leans into the phone listening to the
silence on the other end.
                     C.B. (CONT’D)
           You gonna talk or just hold the
           weight of the world?
She knows him. Ed shifts his weight as he leans against the
wall. His mind is heavy.
                     COACH TEMPLE
           Walter won’t give me a chance.
           Marvin’s boys aren’t up to snuff.
           They can’t even outrun my girls.
                                                                43.

                     C.B.
          See the good, baby. Y’all came in
          first place... in every event, Ed.
          I don't know how you can do better
          than that.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          By getting the job, C.B.
The TIGERBELLES’ LAUGHTER wafts into the room. Ed, still
irritated, furrows his brow.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
              (shouting out the door)
          Hold it down in there!
INT. MAISIE’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
The Girls hear Ed and softly GIGGLE with the forks firmly in
their hands.
                    BILLIE
          Oh, I’m gonna hold it down alright.
She digs into the pie. The Girls quietly laugh as they follow
suit, eating right out of the tin.
Eleanor slips out the room.
RESUME - ED AND C.B. PHONE CONVERSATION - SAME TIME
                    COACH TEMPLE
          And it's not about coming in first.
Eleanor listens on the other side of the door.
                    C.B.
          What’s it about then?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          The girls’ effort. They only get
          one meet a season. They need to
          leave it all out there on the
          track. They’re doing this apart,
          not together. It’s not good enough.
Eleanor takes this in.
                    C.B.
          It wasn’t good enough for what? You
          can’t take your dreams out on
          everyone else.
There’s a KNOCK on the door closest to Ed.
                                                                44.

                    COACH TEMPLE
              (into phone)
          I’ve got to go now. I love you.
He hangs up the phone and steps out into the hallway to find
Eleanor standing there.
                    ELEANOR
          Coach, I’m sorry for interrupting,
          but I think you need to see this.
She shows him the SPORTS ILLUSTRATED MAGAZINE.
INSERT: ELEANOR’S HANDWRITTEN NOTES are on the page.
TIGERBELLES RUNNERS NAMES appear.
Ed studies the page, then locks eyes with Eleanor. Knowing.
She gives a subtle smile. He nods, optimistic... Whatever he
has just read is a game changer.
INT. COACH TEMPLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Ed lugs his bags from Tuskegee inside. Then, he spots his
portly mother-in-law, MAMA GRACE, 60, on the couch
crocheting. She delivers a judgmental glance over the top of
her glasses as he walks in the door.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Oh! Hi, Mama Grace. I wasn't
          expecting you here. Where's C.B.?
                    MAMA GRACE
          She had her literacy program
          meeting at the church. She waited
          and waited on you, and then had to
          call me to watch the kids.
Shit, he forgot. Mama Grace seems to take some joy from this.
HEADLIGHTS shine through the window as the sound of TIRES on
GRAVEL invade the house. C.B. comes in the front door. She
looks at Ed, visibly annoyed.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          C.B., I'm sorry, sweetie. I tried
          to make it back in time, but I had
          some moves to make and fast.
          Eleanor showed me something that--
                    C.B.
          --That could’ve waited. You know I
          have commitments and
          responsibilities too.
                    MAMA GRACE
          To the Lord!
Both C.B. and Ed throw Mama Grace a glance.
                                                               45.

                    COACH TEMPLE
          Mama Grace, let me drive you home.
                    MAMA GRACE
          At this time of night? What would
          my neighbors think? Oh, no. I'm
          spending the night tonight.
C.B. and Ed turn to one another... not exactly their choice.
INT. COACH TEMPLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
The bedroom is well-kept with his and hers beds. It’s
functionally decorated with practical mid-century decor. Ed
walks in and looks at C.B. in bed, reading a CHURCH PAMPHLET
about her LITERACY PROGRAM.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Good you’re still awake. Something
          I need to show you.
He pulls out the Sports Illustrated Magazine. A WHITE TRACK
TEAM from Texas is on the cover. C.B. raises a brow.
                    C.B.
          Women runners on the cover? That's
          good for you. For next year at
          least.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Look at page eighteen.
She turns the page and now we REVEAL...
INSERT: CHART OF RUNNING TIMES. The Tigerbelles’ TIMES are
written on it by Eleanor for comparison.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          They got the cover with those
          times. Their time in the one
          hundred is point five below our
          slowest runner. Point seven in the
          two hundred.
C.B. closely examines the page.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          And look at the relay. These Texas
          girls aren’t the best runners in
          country. My girls are.
He swallows hard, but is certain.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          The National meet is in six weeks.
          In New York.
                                                               46.

C.B. shakes her head, knowing what this means.
                    C.B.
          National meet, not a Colored meet.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          That’s why I stayed behind in
          Tuskegee.
He settles on the bed next to C.B.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          I need to put ‘em up against a
          whole set of runners they don’t
          know. Both men and women.
                    C.B.
          But your speed is your speed, isn’t
          it? Doesn’t matter who’s running.
                     COACH TEMPLE
          Beating each other at practice only
          gets them so far. I gotta bring ‘em
          together, C.B.
              (beat)
          To beat them white girls, they need
          an ‘us against the world’
          mentality. And they can’t be an
          ‘us’ if they’re focused on ‘I.’
C.B. nods in agreement as she sits up in bed.
                    C.B.
          Is President Davis on board with
          this plan of bringing in other
          runners? You think he’s gonna let
          the girls run up against grown men?
His silence is a resounding no, but to clarify:
                    COACH TEMPLE
          High school boys, not men.
                    C.B.
          How are you gonna creep around and
          do this without getting caught?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          There’ll be hurdles, but I can
          clear them. Baby, if we win in New
          York there’s no way Walter can keep
          snubbing me. It’ll be the first for
          the school. Hell, the first for any
          Black college.
C.B.’s eyes move to the literacy pamphlet, then back to him.
                                                               47.

                     C.B.
          Six more weeks of training and
          fundraising... I’ve got my own work
          to do, Ed.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          I’ll make it up to you.
She purses her lips.
                    C.B.
          Oh, so you want my mama to keep
          showing up at the house, I see.
He chuckles.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Not one bit. I can’t do this.
He cuddles up to her and kisses her neck.
                    C.B.
              (giggling, whispering)
          Mama’s in the other room.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Then you best be quiet.
The two whisper and make love.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - EVENING
Wilma trains alone on the track. Determined, she’s wearing
the brace Ed gave her. Jesse and his TEAMMATES pack up their
gear at the end of football practice. Jesse lingers behind
his Teammates to watch Wilma run. She's natural and
beautiful. He walks toward her and she slows down to a trot.
                    JESSE
          Your stride’s looking good.
                    WILMA
          Coach swears this thing is helping,
          but I don’t know.
She fidgets with the brace, embarrassed. Jesse notices.
                    JESSE
          It’s just another piece of
          equipment. No different from my
          helmet or shoulder pads.
She nods, grateful for his kind words.
                    JESSE (CONT’D)
          I'm excited to see what y’all pull
          out in New York. I can't wait.
                                                          48.

                    WILMA
          What you talking ‘bout?
                    JESSE
          Coach asked me to help drive y’all
          up there.
Wilma tries not to look excited about the news.
                    JESSE (CONT’D)
          I thought he was done with me after
          the other night, but he wants to
          pay me to go. But I won’t take it.
                    WILMA
          Boy, you crazy. You coulda loaned
          me the money.
                    JESSE
          What I’m about to witness you doing
          on that track is priceless. Why
          take anything less?
Wilma cuts her eyes to the ground.
                    WILMA
              (exhales)
          I’m kinda nervous.
                    JESSE
          You're as good as any runner I've
          ever seen. Girl, you are fast.
A smile comes to her face.
                    JESSE (CONT’D)
          But you could work on your head
          games, though.
Huh? Her smile falls.
                    WILMA
          Head games?
                    JESSE
          Sports aren't just physical.
          You've gotta get your mental game
          together. Get into your opponent’s
          head before the race even starts.
          Lemme see you in the blocks.
Wilma walks over to the blocks and directly settles in.
                    JESSE (CONT’D)
          I'm not afraid of that.
                                                                49.

                    WILMA
          What?
                    JESSE
          That’s not gonna cut it. I'm not
          second guessing myself. Look here,
          watch me.
Jesse gets into the blocks next to her.
                    JESSE (CONT’D)
          Get close. Take up space.
He's close to her, intimate. Their bodies just inches away.
                    JESSE (CONT’D)
          If you stretch, make it wide. If
          you jump, make it high. Don't look
          at nobody, but make sure everyone
          can see you. Be a blind peacock.
                    WILMA
          A blind peacock?
                     JESSE
              (nods)
          Beautiful and don’t even know it.
They steal a glance at each other. Both liking what they see.
Wilma’s breaks eye contact and Jesse picks up on it... the
intimacy’s too much. He switches gears.
                    JESSE (CONT’D)
          Runners on your marks. And... Go!
They take off running together, playfully racing, laughing.
                                                  CUT TO:
MONTAGE - 4 WEEKS UNTIL NEW YORK:
-- Barbara slides through COUPLES slow grinding on the dance
floor at the ALPHA’s frat house. Wendell rolls a cigarette
during a spades game. He sees Barbara and jumps up. Wendell
happily leads her into the party.
-- The life of her own party, Billie’s at a JUKE JOINT
grinding and throwing back drinks.
-- Wilma shakes Yolanda’s bottle while skimming the graded
test in her hand. She got a C. Yolanda squirms in her arms.
She holds the poor test in her mouth during feeding.
-- Late, Eleanor’s in bed looking over her track notes. She
hears LAUGHTER outside. She peeks out of her window to see
GROUPS of GIRLS having fun. She closes her shade.
                                                                 50.

-- Wilma counts out a tiny stack of CASH. She stuffs all but
$3 in an ENVELOPE addressed to her MOTHER.
-- Wilma and Barbara come to the dorm late from practice.
Stomach growling, Wilma looks at the clock. It's 10 P.M. She
turns to her pile of books, sighs and sits down to start
studying.
-- Ed adjusts the brace on Wilma’s body. She winces as it
digs further into her skin.
-- Exhausted, Wilma prepares an ice bath. She SCREAMS when
she plunges into the freezing water.
-- The Tigerbelles run hard. Energy wavers. Ed YELLS from the
sidelines.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Push!
-- Ed monitors Billie and Barbara as they struggle doing push-
ups and crunches.
-- Morning sun comes through the window to find Billie’s in
bed still dressed from her night on the town. She snores
drunkenly.
INT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
The family is having a sit-down dinner. C.B. exhales as Ed
talks animatedly.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          The girls aren’t giving me their
          all at practice. They’re not
          focused.
                     C.B.
          Well, all I know is that I’m happy
          to have us all eating together for
          a change.
              (then)
          How was your day at school, Edwina?
Before Edwina can answer, Ed keeps on talking.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          They’re just coasting on their raw
          talent. But everyone at this AAU
          meet is gonna have the same kind of
          raw talent. We’re gonna be the
          first all-Black team at this event.
          All eyes will be on us.
C.B. sighs. She’s not going to win this battle.
                                                               51.

                    C.B.
          They know that. No Negro who has
          the potential to be ‘first’ at
          something doesn’t realize those
          stakes. But, Ed, these girls aren’t
          professional athletes. They’re
          college students. Beyond all of
          your practices, they’ve got the
          early morning classes, the late
          night studying...
                    COACH TEMPLE
          ...the parties, the
          extracurriculars, the boys.
A light bulb goes off. He suddenly grabs his jacket.
                    EDWINA
          Daddy, where are you going?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          I’ll be back.
                    C.B.
          Ed?
                    COACH TEMPLE
              (to Edwina and Lloyd)
          Y’all get to bed on time, you hear?
C.B. grits her teeth as the door SLAMS behind him.
EXT. HALE HALL / INT. COACH TEMPLE'S STATION WAGON - LATER
Ed stakes out in his station wagon across from the dorm. All
is peaceful and quiet. He yawns and checks his watch.
Suddenly, a PACK OF SORORITY PLEDGES wearing dunce caps exit
the AKA SORORITY HOUSE across the way. The AKAs, dressed in
pink and green, bark orders at the Pledges as they do army
crawls in the dirt.
Ed puts his glasses on to take a better look. Amongst the
group, he sees BARBARA! They finish the drill and disperse.
Barbara’s worn-out as she stumbles to the dorm.
                    COACH TEMPLE
              (mumbling to himself)
          Pledging...
As Ed shakes his head in disappointment, a shiny CADILLAC
squeals up to the dorm curb. Out climbs BILLIE!
Aghast, Ed FLASHES his headlights and HONKS. Billie,
startled, squints to see who’s honking. She recognizes Coach
Temple’s car.
                                                                52.

                    BILLIE
          Shit.
She makes a run for it and heads directly to the dorm.
                    COACH TEMPLE
              (to himself)
          You running faster now than you do
          in practice.
INT. HALE HALL - HALLWAY - SAME TIME
Billie comes thundering down the hall. Barbara pops her head
out her door.
                    BARBARA
          What’s wrong? Someone chasing you?
In pajamas and an old housecoat, Eleanor pokes her head out
her door.
                    ELEANOR
          What’s all this commotion about?
                    BILLIE
          Coach is outside! He caught me
          sneaking in!
They bolt to the window and peer down on Coach Temple’s car.
BACK OUTSIDE
Wilma and Jesse carry to a stack of books as they head for
the dorms.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Not Skeeter too. These girls take
          me for a damn fool! Not tonight!
Ed speeds his car toward Wilma and Jesse. She’s a deer in his
headlights.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          What’s going on here? Curfew was
          two hours ago!
                    WILMA
          Coach... I'm sorry... I... I just--
                    JESSE
          Coach, Skeeter wasn’t--
                    COACH TEMPLE
          --I don't need any explanation from
          you, son. This is between me and my
          runner.
                                                                53.

Wilma takes a deep breath. This is gonna be difficult.
                    WILMA
          I’m failing math. School comes
          before running, right?
Ed can’t argue with his own rules.
                    WILMA (CONT’D)
          Jesse’s helping me study. He can’t
          come in the dorms and the library
          just closed.
Even though they can’t hear the conversation, Barbara,
Billie, and Eleanor watch the drama unfold FROM THE DORM
WINDOW. They might as well have popcorn.
                    WILMA (CONT’D)
          That’s why I missed curfew. Am I
          off the team?
Jesse waits with baited breath.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Goodnight, Jesse.
Cue noted. Jesse carefully places several more books into
Wilma’s arms before leaving.
FROM THE DORM WINDOW: Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor stay
focused on Ed and Wilma. He’s very animated. They turn to one
another with a knowing look... this can’t be good.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - DAY
Ed BLOWS THE WHISTLE to end practice. The Tigerbelles are
sweat-soaked and worn.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Not sure what happened, but y’all
          really pushed yourselves today.
          Good job.
Barbara and Billie exchange a glance as they all pack up.
                    BARBARA
              (whispers)
          He didn’t say nothing.
                    BILLIE
              (whispers)
          I’m not gonna stick around to see
          that change.
They pack faster and begin to leave the field with Wilma and
Eleanor.
                                                                54.

                    COACH TEMPLE
          Barbara? Billie?
Shit. Barbara and Billie both stop in their tracks. Wilma and
Eleanor slow their pace, listening from a distance.
                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Since you both like to be running
          all around town after curfew, maybe
          you’ll like running a few more laps
          around the track. Fifteen laps.
              (then)
          Eleanor, stay and keep their tally.
          Make sure they aren’t cutting
          corners.
                    BARBARA
          What about Skeeter? She was out
          past curfew too last night too.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          That’s another eight laps for not
          minding your own business.
Billie starts to protest, but Ed BLOWS his WHISTLE.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Get to work.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - NIGHT
Wilma, Billie, Barbara, and Eleanor, all in their Tigerbelles
uniforms, walk toward a handful of CARS illuminating the
track with headlights. Barbara pulls at her uniform.
                    BARBARA
          What kinda practice is this?
                    BILLIE
          A mess. Probably a weigh-in to make
          sure we ain’t got too big.
                    WILMA
          You sure about this, Eleanor?
                    ELEANOR
          Coach said be here at 9.
Billie scans the darkened area. She can’t see if anyone is in
the cars.
                    BILLIE
          Sending Black folks into a dark
          field can’t ever end well.
                                                                55.

As the Tigerbelles emerge closer to the track, a CAR DOOR
OPENS. They hesitate until they see Ed get out of his car,
with his whistle, stopwatch, and clipboard in hand.
                    BARBARA
          What’s going on?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Your next meet.
Suddenly, PEOPLE emerge from the other cars. FOUR HIGH SCHOOL
BOYS, Black 14, and 4 HBCU ALUMNI WOMEN TRACK TEAM, Black 25.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Your competition.
Wilma, Eleanor, Barbara, and Billie take in the teams. Billie
puts her hand on her hip.
                    BILLIE
          Now I don’t mean no harm, but what
          makes you think some boys who can’t
          grow a beard and some old women who
          probably growing beards, can
          compete with us?
Barbara stifles her laughter. Wilma and Eleanor half-grin.
                    BARBARA
          Coach, I don’t want to question
          your methods--
                     COACH TEMPLE
          --But you can’t help yourself. Go
          ahead, BJ.
                    BARBARA
          We’re faster. This is a waste.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          The Texas girls get fifteen races a
          season. Y’all get one. Practice is
          never as good as the real deal.
                    ELEANOR
          I guess a dress rehearsal couldn’t
          hurt us.
A string of ‘Whatever’ shrugs and unenthusiastic nods pepper
Wilma, Billie, and Barbara’s faces. Ed hands them their BIBS.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          We’re doing everything by
          regulation like a real meet. As
          real I can make it anyway.
                                                               56.

The Girls see Ed has accumulated some REFEREES. Jesse puts
the final touches on the FRESH LANE LINES. Wendell holds
FINISH LINE ROLLS. Ed’s called all hands on deck.
Billie puts on her bib and starts for the track.
                    BILLIE
          Let’s go ‘head and beat these folks
          so I can go to bed.
                                                   CUT TO:
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - LATER
4x200: Winded, Billie PANTS as she runs full speed at the
TURN. Her head slightly turns to either side. She’s actually
being matched by the HIGH SCHOOL RUNNER and the HBCU RUNNER!
Billie is shocked as hell. Ed watches, astounded.
Pouring with sweat, Billie pushes harder and harder to find
herself LAST. Eleanor anxiously awaits the baton.
                    ELEANOR
          Hurry up, Billie!
Billie finally sticks the handoff. Eleanor concentrates as
she breathes RHYTHMICALLY to count her step count. In the
turn, her habitual syncopated cadence is thrown off. She
can’t turn her burners on. Barbara sighs heavily as she
watches Eleanor’s squinted face approach.
                    BARBARA
          Dig it out, Eleanor!
Handoff complete. Barbara’s usual slick glide is enough to
catch the HBCU RUNNER, but she’s a step away from the HIGH
SCHOOL RUNNER.
Wilma keeps her eyes locked forward as Barbara approaches.
She holds out her hand. Flat. Palm upwards... waiting to
accept. As Barbara goes to deliver the baton with a single
swift deliberate smack, they bobble the handoff AGAIN!
                    BARBARA (CONT’D)
          Damnit!
They try to stick it again, but go outside of their
changeover zone! Billie and Eleanor immediately double over.
Ed lays into the whistle. FWEET!!!!!
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Disqualified!
                    BARBARA
              (to Wilma)
          Why can’t you keep your hand still?
                                                                57.

                    WILMA
          I didn’t make us go out the zone!
                    BILLIE
          BJ, you the one who messed up.
Barbara spins around ready to unload, but Eleanor hops in.
                    ELEANOR
              (to Billie)
          Stay out of it. We wouldn’t be here
          if you got out the blocks on time.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Girls.
                    BARBARA
          If Skeeter’d stop showing off--
                    WILMA
          --I know you ain’t talking!
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Enough!
Barbara and Wilma stop arguing.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          See, this right here is why coaches
          don’t mess with girls. This is why
          I didn’t want this team in the
          first place.
The Tigerbelles are stung and hurt by all this.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          How can anybody else take y’all
          seriously if you don’t take
          yourselves seriously? I can’t get
          y’all to focus for two seconds on
          the track cause you’re always
          distracted by booze and boys!
Seething, Ed starts to walk away.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
              (over his shoulder)
          Baton handoffs and conditioning at
          five a.m. sharp.
                    BILLIE
          That’s too early.
Ed spins around, his fury and disappointment with them swirls
on his hardened face.
                                                                58.

                    COACH TEMPLE
          If you can stay in a bottle of
          liquor that late, you can get up
          that early.
Ed goes over to the COACHES, REFEREES, and other RUNNERS.
Jesse sympathetically looks at Wilma. Barbara, embarrassed,
avoids Wendell’s gaze.
Demoralized, dejected and DQ’d... they stand as the most
separate foursome ever.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - KEAN HALL - NIGHT
The smooth, low rumble of a BARITONE SAX BLOWS while a TRIO
OF FEMALES SINGERS snap their fingers to the beat. The R&B
MUSIC from the LIVE BAND weaves through the elegantly dressed
COLLEGE COUPLES dancing. Hanging sign read: HOMECOMING 1959.
AT A PHOTO BACKDROP
Wilma and Robert pose for formal portraits. Robert’s suit is
a little ill-fitting and unstylish. It’s definitely more of a
hand-me-down Sunday suit than a formal one.
Barbara and Wendell sit with Eleanor. Naturally, Barbara’s
decked out fabulously. Eleanor has done little to transform
her look. She still clings to her infamous notebook.
                     BARBARA
              (re: Eleanor’s notebook)
          You taking notes on how to have a
          good time?
                    ELEANOR
          I’ll write that one down.
                    BARBARA
          You need to be writing down how
          Coach is playing favorites.
                    ELEANOR
          He’s a fair man.
                    BARBARA
          Oh, really? He catches Skeeter with
          Jesse and nothing. He ran me and
          Billie for three hours after
          practice that night. That seem fair
          to you?
Barbara stops her rant to take a bite off her plate. Eleanor
jots something down in her notebook.
                    BARBARA (CONT’D)
          Are you writing down what I'm
          eating to tell Coach?
                                                                59.

                     ELEANOR
          Who do you think sent me here to
          chaperone?
                    BARBARA
              (aghast)
          Eleanor! Dang, can’t you be one of
          us for second?!
Billie arrives, turning heads, but dressed more for a
nightclub than a formal. She catches Wilma’s eye.
                    WILMA
          Hey, Billie. Looking good.
Wilma gives her a warm smile, but Billie simply ignores her
and walks on. Wilma’s face falls. Then--
                    BARBARA
          Billie! Over here!
Billie perks up and Wilma notices, hurt. Billie walks over to
join Barbara and Eleanor. She sizes up Eleanor’s attire.
                    BILLIE
          No man tonight, Eleanor? Oh wait,
          that’s every night.
In fun, Billie winks. Eleanor merely responds with an
unbothered look.
                    BARBARA
          Billie’s right, Eleanor. You keep
          dressing dowdy like that you’re
          gonna end up an Old Maid.
Eleanor scans her attire.
WITH WILMA ACROSS THE ROOM
Robert notices a cloud cross Wilma's face; she’s noticed the
cold shoulder Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor are giving her.
                    WILMA
          I'm gonna go get some punch. I'll
          meet you back at the table.
Robert heads to join the Tigerbelles and their DATES. As
Wilma heads for the punch, Jesse enters in his well-cut,
stylish and sharp suit. He stops her en route.
                    JESSE
          You look better than mama's
          biscuits tonight, girl.
                                                               60.

WITH ROBERT AT THE TIGERBELLES’ TABLE
                    ROBERT
          Y’all ready for the white folks’
          track meet?
                    ELEANOR
          Won’t be white anymore after we get
          there. We are the TSU Integrators!
Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor give each other hand-slides and
self-assured nods; they proudly smile at the accomplishment.
                    ROBERT
          I never woulda thought Skeeter
          going to college would take her all
          the way to The Big Apple.
                    BARBARA
          That’s where Wendell and I are
          moving once he finishes dental
          school.
Wendell looks over at Barbara, confused.
                    ROBERT
          You gonna be a dentist?
                    WENDELL
          I guess so. And a Yankee too,
          apparently.
Everyone laughs. Suddenly, the Crowd starts CHEERING. The MC
of the event comes to the front of the stage.
                    MC
          Now bringing y’all the one, the
          only... Mr. Ray Charles!
FINGERS start to pound the piano keys, playing the opening
notes of “What’d I Say.” Eleanor puts her notebook down and
jumps up, clapping to the beat. Billie and Barbara both join
her, screaming with excitement.
                    BILLIE
          Ray!!!!
RAY CHARLES, 29, does his signature side rock as the TSU
Crowd goes wild.
                    RAY CHARLES
              (singing)
          ‘Hey mama, don't you treat me
          wrong. Come and love me all night
          long. Oh oh, hey hey.’
                                                                61.

As Barbara, Billie, Eleanor, and Wendell dance, Robert’s on
cloud nine. He searches through the Crowd. Suddenly, he looks
like he got hit by a truck.
Jesse and Wilma are dancing! Jesse holds Wilma’s hand as he
gets into the dance. She giggles with joy.
                    ROBERT
              (to himself)
          What the hell?
Billie turns around to find Robert clenching his teeth. She
nudges Barbara. They watch Robert, pissed, cut through the
Crowd toward them.
                    BILLIE
          Let’s see her get outta this one.
Robert comes up behind Wilma. His eyes cutting into Jesse.
                    ROBERT
          Who the hell is he?
Wilma spins around seeing Robert’s scrunched face.
                    WILMA
          Oh, this is Jesse. He’s in my Math
          class.
                    ROBERT
          I don’t think they teaching y’all
          to move like that in Math class.
Jesse slides in between Wilma and Robert.
                    JESSE
          Just calm down, man.
                    ROBERT
          I don’t wanna hear nothing you
          gotta say. You hear me?
Eleanor has now joined Barbara and Billie in looking at the
brewing tension between Robert and Jesse.
                       ELEANOR
          Good Lord.
Eleanor grabs Barbara and Billie, quickly pulling them toward
Wilma, Robert, and Jesse.
Wilma steps in between Jesse and Robert.
                    WILMA
              (to Robert)
          You stop this now.
                                                               62.

                    ROBERT
          Is he why you don’t come home to me
          and Yolan--
                     WILMA
          --Don’t!
                    ROBERT
          Oh, that’s right. He don’t know.
                    WILMA
          Please, Robert. Not here.
                    ROBERT
          Why don’t you please stop telling
          me lies?
                    WILMA
          I’m not lying to you.
Robert isn’t convinced.
                    JESSE
          Go on home, Robert.
When Jesse puts his hand on Wilma’s shoulder, a rage sets
across Robert’s face.
                    ROBERT
          Stay away from my girl!
Robert PUNCHES Jesse. The Tigerbelles SCREAM as Jesse hits
the floor.
                     WILMA
          Robert!
Jesse collects himself and begins to return the punches. A
couple of his FOOTBALL TEAMMATES run over. Wendell and his
FRAT BROTHERS rush in to shut this down... they hold back
Jesse and his Teammates from Robert.
Wilma looks mortified, Barbara and Eleanor are appalled, but
Billie is smugly satisfied.
                    ELEANOR
          This isn’t funny, Billie.
                    BILLIE
          Oh, I know it ain’t.
Wilma looks over at Billie who makes sure to speak loud
enough for Wilma to hear.
                    BILLIE (CONT’D)
          Neither was running all night.
                                                                63.

Billie’s very pointed with this and Wilma can do nothing, but
run out of the room.
                     ELEANOR
          That was Coach’s call, Billie. Not
          Skeeter’s.
There’s truth in this and Billie knows it. Pride still bigger
than reasoning, Billie shrugs her shoulders and walks off.
EXT. PARKING LOT - ROBERT’S PICKUP TRUCK - LATER THAT NIGHT
Solemn, Wilma and Robert lean against his truck.
                    WILMA
          You embarrassed me.
                    ROBERT
          Embarrassed you? You had me in
          there looking like a plum fool!
                    WILMA
          I told you Jesse’s just a friend.
                    ROBERT
          I don’t need no college degree to
          know what I saw.
Robert hops in his truck.
                    WILMA
          Don’t leave.
Robert doesn’t bother to respond. He speeds off leaving Wilma
alone in the parking lot.
EXT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
The Tigerbelles load their suitcases into the back of Coach
Temple’s station wagon. Ed kneels down in front of Edwina and
Lloyd. C.B. stands behind them.
                    EDWINA
          Will you bring us gifts from New
          York, Daddy?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Depends if y’all are gonna be good
          for your mama.
                     EDWINA
          We will!
He gives each of the them a kiss goodbye. When Ed goes to hug
C.B., she hands him a box full of BAGGED LUNCHES. Clearly,
there won’t be any hugs coming his way. He peers over his
shoulder to make sure The Tigerbelles can’t hear.
                                                                64.

                     COACH TEMPLE
           You still mad at me?
C.B. doesn’t say anything.
                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
           If I could stay to support your
           little event, I would.
She’s taken aback by his phrasing.
                     C.B.
           ‘Little event?’
                     COACH TEMPLE
           You know what I mean, C.B.
                     C.B.
           I’m beginning to see that.
He checks again to make sure they aren’t being overhead.
                     COACH TEMPLE
           Baby, I apologized.
                     C.B.
           You can’t take your team giving
           excuses, but you’re quick to give
           ‘em yourself, aren’t you?
C.B. takes out a few bagged lunches from the box. She puts on
a smile and goes over to join The Tigerbelles at the car. She
hands each girl a paper bag.
                     C.B. (CONT’D)
           Lunch bag for the trip, ladies.
           Coach wants to limit the stops.
Wilma and Billie peer into the paper bag.
THEIR POV: There’s a SANDWICH wrapped in wax paper, an APPLE,
a COOKIE, and an EMPTY MASON JAR. Wilma and Billie sneak a
look at each other in confusion about the empty jar.
           WILMA                        BILLIE
Thank you, ma'am.            Thanks, Mrs. Temple.
Barbara and Eleanor give C.B. a warm smile of appreciation.
                     C.B.
           You're welcome, girls. But if you
           wanna thank me, y’all do your best.
           And I know your best is nothing
           short of winning.
                                                               65.

The Tigerbelles beam at C.B.’s support. Ed uses this warm
moment as a nice segue into stealing a kiss goodbye. C.B.
returns it, but it’s not the warmest moment.
                    C.B. (CONT’D)
          Be careful, Ed.
He watches her put her arms around Edwina and Lloyd. Nearby,
Jesse jogs up with his bag. He tosses it in the car. Wilma
pulls Jesse to the side for privacy.
                    WILMA
          Jesse, I’m sorry about what
          happened at the dance.
                    JESSE
          It wasn’t your fault. Beautiful
          girls make men do crazy things.
          Don’t you worry about it. Barely a
          scratch.
Wilma is thankful for his playing down the severity.
                    JESSE (CONT’D)
          Now let’s get on the road.
EXT. NASHVILLE / INT. COACH TEMPLE’S STATION WAGON - DAY
Jesse drives while Ed sits shotgun, going over paperwork.
Wilma gazes out the window.
HER POV: The car passes MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE, where she
was treated as a child. An OLDER WOMAN with polio comes out
on crutches with the aid of a NURSE.
Wilma adjusts the brace that Ed makes her wear... a constant
reminder of how her childhood struggles are still with her.
I/E. COACH TEMPLE’S STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON
They’re deep in countryside now. Jesse flips on the radio.
"Baby You've Got What it Takes" by Brook Benton and Dinah
Washington. Barbara wiggles uncomfortably in her seat.
                    BARBARA
          Um... Coach? I need to stop.
                    BILLIE
          For what? You can't be hungry, you
          already ate your sandwich.
                    ELEANOR
          And half of mine.
                                                             66.

                    COACH TEMPLE
          No unscheduled stops. We’ll stretch
          our legs once we get to
          Philadelphia.
Wilma watches Barbara continue to squirm in her seat.
                    WILMA
          Well, how far away is that?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          I don't know. 300 miles or so.
                    BARBARA
          Coach, I cannot wait that long. I
          need to use the ladies’ room now.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          If you have to do your business, do
          your business.
The Girls are confused. Wilma fishes around her lunch sack
and pulls out her empty jar.
                    WILMA
              (realizing)
          Uh...
The Tigerbelles looks vary from disgust to disbelief.
                    BARBARA
          What? I'm not peeing in no jar.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Well, we're not stopping so figure
          it out. When I was a runner back in
          the day, we used jars when we
          traveled. There's a modesty sheet
          behind you if you need it.
They check the space behind them to see a FOLDED SHEET.
                    ELEANOR
          Coach, these are young ladies here.
                    BARBARA
          I will not, I cannot... pee in a
          jar.
                    JESSE
          Coach, it's fine. I can pull over.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          No, you can't. We're a car of
          Negroes driving through Virginia.
          I don't want any run-ins.
                                                                67.

                    ELEANOR
          Didn’t you bring a Green Book?
          Surely it can direct us to a safe
          place to stop.
                    COACH TEMPLE
              (holds up a Green Book)
          Yes, of course I have it! There
          are no places listed that are
          welcoming to Negroes until we get
          into Maryland. We're not stopping.
          Like I said, if you need to do your
          business, do your business.
Barbara looks disgustedly and inquisitively at the jar.
                    BARBARA
          How? How exactly am I supposed to
          do this?
                    ELEANOR
          Sir, she’s right. The equipment and
          mechanics is a little different
          from men.
                    BILLIE
          How would you know?
                    BARBARA
              (indignantly)
          If I tell my Daddy that you took us
          on an eight hundred mile road trip
          and wouldn't pull over so that we
          could relieve ourselves with the
          tiniest bit of dignity, that you
          had us use mason jars while two men
          sat within arms reach in the front
          seat... he will blow his top. And
          you do not want my Daddy to blow
          his top.
EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER
The Station Wagon pulls over to a wooded area near a dirt
driveway that leads down to a property. The Tigerbelles climb
out, a little triumphant. Jesse glances after them, Ed throws
him the modesty sheet to cover his eyes.
WITH THE GIRLS IN THE BUSHES
They stride hurriedly into the bushes to pee. Barbara is
especially vexed and struggling with her fussy coat and purse
to hurry and relieve herself.
                    WILMA
          BJ, why did you bring your
          pocketbook?
                                                                68.

                    BARBARA
          Because it matches my shoes.
Eleanor and Billie just stare at her in disbelief.
                     BILLIE
              (then)
          Can you believe that man?
                    BARBARA
          I know. Suggesting we pee in a jar?
                    WILMA
          And he was serious.
                    ELEANOR
          The idea of treating us no
          differently than male athletes
          certainly has its limitations.
They all squat down to pee.
BACK WITH ED AND JESSE
They stretch their legs outside of the station wagon. A
POLICE CAR approaches. Ed motions to Jesse.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Pretend like you checking the tire.
Jesse does as told. A WHITE OFFICER looks out of his window,
taking in the scene as he drives slowly. Jesse fiddles with
the tire. Ed holds his breath. But the Officer doesn’t stop,
he drives off. Ed and Jesse exhale in relief. Then...
A FARM TRUCK
...toting a FARM DOG pulls up onto the property. It slows
upon seeing Ed and Jesse. They tense up. The Tigerbelles
emerge from the bushes jovial and buoyant. The DOG begins to
BARK wildly.
The driver’s door opens slowly... a SHOTGUN BARREL appears
through the crack. The door swings open to reveal a pimple-
faced WHITE BOY, 14, dressed in too-large overalls. The gun’s
so heavy it’s awkward in his arms.
                    WHITE BOY
          What the hell y’all doin’ on my
          property?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          We're just leaving. My girls were
          begging for a pit stop.
                                                                69.

                    WHITE BOY
          A ‘piss stop?’ You pulled over to
          piss on my land?
Barbara tries to maintain a straight face at his blunder.
                    BARBARA
          Your land? You own this?
Ed throws her a death glare. Eleanor slyly hits Barbara in
her side to shut up.
                    WHITE BOY
          My daddy do. And he ain’t gon’ be
          happy ‘bout a bunch of niggers
          pullin’ on his land.
Everyone stiffens. Ed knows this could go badly.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Young man, sir, I'm sorry. We
          didn't realize. We meant no
          disrespect, sir.
The Tigerbelles watch Ed’s humble plea. This is a side of
their coach they've never seen before.
                    BARBARA
              (under her breath)
          Sir? That child’s voice hasn’t even
          changed yet.
Ed shoots her another look to keep quiet, as do Jesse and the
rest of the Girls.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          We're just driving through on our
          way to New York for the track and
          field National Championships. We
          don't want any trouble, sir. We'll
          be on our way.
The White Boy, with his gun clumsily and dangerously aimed at
the group, steps closer to the station wagon.
                    WHITE BOY
          I reckon that’s a good idea.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Thank you, sir.
              (to Jesse and the Girls)
          Get in the car.
They hurriedly climb inside, not daring to look back.
                                                              70.

INT. COACH TEMPLE’S STATION WAGON - MOMENTS LATER
Everyone sits shaken by this close call. Jesse tries to
lighten the mood.
                    JESSE
          Much as y’all have been training,
          you could’ve outrun his rusty old
          truck. That mangy mutt too.
Wilma and the Girls force a chuckle. But Ed’s grim, still
affected by the moment.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Were y’all gonna outrun the
          bullets, too?
Everyone goes quiet.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          And, Barbara...
Ed turns, looks Barbara squarely in the eye.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          You might not know this, but I’m
          from Philadelphia. I understand
          Northern thought. But that Chicago
          mouth and attitude is gonna get you
          in a world of trouble down here in
          the South. Your tail best learn
          when to button that lip pretty damn
          quick if you wanna live.
Ed faces forward.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Now tell your daddy that.
Everyone sits in silence and reflection.
EXT. HARLEM STREETS - DUSK
The station wagon crosses 125th Street and into Harlem.
STYLISH BLACK PEOPLE cruise the streets. Ed’s station wagon
pulls up outside of the HOTEL THERESA.
INT. HOTEL THERESA - MOMENTS LATER
The Tigerbelles bubble with excitement.
                    ELEANOR
          Coach, I think it might be a good
          idea if we stretch our legs and get
          the blood flowing before tomorrow.
                                                                71.

                    COACH TEMPLE
          Good thinking. I’ll see if we can
          run in the alley out back.
                    ELEANOR
          I meant a walk, sir. There are some
          important historical landmarks
          nearby. And we are students first.
Ed is grumpy, but it’s hard to argue with her logic.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Okay, but be back in three hours.
          Jesse, you’re bunking with me.
              (to the Girls)
          Don't make me regret giving you
          some slack.
                    BILLIE
          Come on, Eleanor. Introduce us to
          this ‘Apollo’ fella.
Before Eleanor has a chance to protest, Billie and Barbara
hook her arm and whisk her away. Only Jesse and Wilma remain.
                    JESSE
          I was thinking I'd find a bite to
          eat. Wanna join me?
EXT. HARLEM - STRIVER’S ROW - LATER THAT NIGHT
The LIGHTS sparkle. Romantic. Idyllic. Wilma and Jesse walk.
                    WILMA
          My mama told me I could take on
          anything in the whole world. Didn’t
          ever think it’d take me here.
Jesse takes this in.
                    JESSE
          Sounds like a wise woman.
Wilma’s mind wanders...
                    WILMA
          I was a really sick child.
                    JESSE
              (somewhat certain)
          Polio?
                     WILMA
          Yeah. Doctors said I’d never walk
          again. My mother said I would.
              (beat)
          I believed my mother.
                                                       72.

Jesse looks at her anew; taking her in with awe.
                    JESSE
          Never supposed to walk and now here
          you are... a college track star.
          Well, you've certainly made a
          recovery. In every way.
He sweetly compliments her figure. Wilma blushes and
deflects, embarrassed by the attention.
                    WILMA
          Well, what's your story?
                    JESSE
          My people are from North Carolina.
          It's just me and my older brother
          as far as kids go. He sorta fell
          into the family business. Farming.
          He didn't finish high school and I
          decided I didn't want that life. I
          knew that college was gonna be the
          only way to get outta there.
                    WILMA
          So, was it football that brought
          you to TSU?
                     JESSE
          Yep. I’m trying to go pro.
              (beat)
          So, uh, after all this, you’re just
          gonna go right back home? To
          Robert?
                    WILMA
          Not back to him,   but my family. I
          mean, where else   am I supposed to
          go? I wish there   was something like
          football for us,   but there’s not.
          So, I’ll go back   home and teach.
                    JESSE
          You’ve faced so many limitations in
          life, why limit your dreams?
                    WILMA
          I ain’t think I was. Being a
          teacher is dreaming too low?
                    JESSE
          Not at all. Thinking track has to
          stop at graduation is.
                                                                73.

                    WILMA
          That’s a long way off. And if I
          can’t pass Algebra, it won’t make a
          difference anyway.
Jesse folds his arms, disagreeing.
                    JESSE
          You built it up to an A-.
                    WILMA
          Thanks to you.
                    JESSE
          I’m your backup, Skeeter. You’ve
          always been the star.

Damn, he’s too sweet. Wilma meets his eyes. Jesse takes her
hand. Wilma’s hesitant as hell, her uncertain eyes meeting
Jesse’s as he takes a step closer to her. The romantic energy
is palpable. He leans in and the romantic moment overtakes
Wilma’s initial resistance. They kiss with the lights of the
big city twinkling all around them.
E/I. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - MORNING
CIRCUS TRUCKS pack up outside with ANIMALS, JUGGLERS,
ACROBATS, CARNIES, the whole nine yards. Ed leads The
Tigerbelles past the spectacle.
Ahead of them lies the track. In the middle of the field are
a sea of WHITE TRACK TEAMS warming up. Bodies buzz around in
every direction. The Tigerbelles take in the scope of the
event. The stakes could not be more visual: They are the only
Black runners here.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Ok, girls. We have everything to
          prove today. Doing well here will
          change how TSU thinks about women’s
          track. That means better equipment,
          more scholarships...
                    BARBARA
              (under her breath)
          I’m not on scholarship.
Wilma and Billie both jab her.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          We have to prove that we have the
          right to be here. I need complete
          focus and 110%. Eleanor, run ‘em
          through the warm up.
Ed gets in the TEAM CHECK-IN LINE. It’s long and
disorganized.
                                                               74.

He stands behind COACH ABERNATHY, 50, the white coach of the
Texas team featured in the Sports Illustrated article. Ed
does some small talk.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          I thought this meet would be a
          little more organized. I mean, when
          a circus prevents you from a proper
          warm up.
Coach Abernathy finally looks at Ed. He doesn’t seem to be
impressed, rather Abernathy’s amused.
                    COACH ABERNATHY
              (matter of fact)
          You’re out of your element, boy.
Ed eyes Coach Abernathy from head to toe. Ed isn’t impressed
by him either.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          The name is Temple. See you on the
          track... Abernathy.
Abernathy’s surprised by this and takes a sudden interest in
Ed, watching him closely as he walks away.
A FEW YARDS AWAY
The Tigerbelles begin to unload near the TEXAS TRACK TEAM.
Barbara leans toward Wilma, Billie, and Eleanor.
                    BARBARA
              (whispers)
          Look. It's them. The ‘cover girls.’
The Texas Team stare at The Tigerbelles who stare back...
each sizing each other up. We recognize JANICE, the Sports
Illustrated cover girl; a tall, immaculately groomed blonde.
                     WILMA
          How can they run with their hair
          that high?
                    BILLIE
          A foot tall bee hive, but no ‘bee-
          hinds.’
Eleanor stares at them as they warm-up. They’ve got a
military-like precision to their training.
                    ELEANOR
          Maybe it’ll slow them down.
                    WILMA
          We’re fast too.
                                                               75.

                    BARBARA
          Yeah, but we just got beat by some
          menopausal women.
                    ELEANOR
          They were in their mid-twenties!
                    BARBARA
          Hitting too close to home?
                    BILLIE
          Eleanor’s two weeks away from being
          asked to join the Mother Board.
Meanwhile, Janice whispers to her own Team. They glance over
to The Tigerbelles and laugh, talking shit of their own.
                    BILLIE (CONT’D)
          You got something to say to me?
Ed walks up, flipping through paperwork.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Girls, don't talk about it, be
          about it. Save it for the track.
                    WILMA
          If we struggle and lose to these
          white girls...
Wilma, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor know the stakes. It
weighs heavily on them. Ed squats down, making sure all eyes
are on them.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Blacks folks have struggle tattooed
          on our souls, yet we keep on going.
Ed hands them their numbers.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          We have eight races today. Billie,
          you're up first in the 200 heat.
          Lane seven.
Eleanor, confused, scans her notebook.
                    ELEANOR
          Why is she in lane seven? Her times
          have earned her a center lane!
                    BILLIE
          Yeah, Coach! Now I’ve gotta deal
          with the turn. That’s not fair.
                                                                76.

                    COACH TEMPLE
          Someone’s moving the goalpost on
          us. Nothing new. But a hurdle ain’t
          nothing to a track athlete, right?
          You just run your race.
Encouraged, the Tigerbelles nod in agreement.
ON THE TRACK - MINUTES LATER
Janice is in lane five, the best lane, shaking herself loose.
Billie passes directly over her blocks to mess with her.
Janice tries to seem unfazed.
THE STARTER readies himself on the sidelines. All RUNNERS
settle themselves into the blocks.
                    BILLIE
          Hey, Blondie.
Janice slightly looks over at Billie.
                    BILLIE (CONT’D)
          You're in my lane.
BAM! The Starter FIRES the starting pistol. Janice falters
getting out of the blocks. Billie’s off like a dart. The
other Runners struggle to keep stride with her. Billie
crosses the finish line FIRST and with panache.
The Tigerbelles all CHEER. Ed remains stoic.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Barbara, you're up next!
Ed notes the grandness of the Crowd and the arena. Barbara
takes off her warmup sweats.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Hey, show this city what you got.
Barbara nods   and struts her way up to her starting block.
BAM! Barbara   WINS her heat without once even looking at her
competition.   As she crosses the finish line, her eyes are
caught up in   all of the SPECTATORS in the stands.
Coach Abernathy YELLS at his Team. He glares at Ed, not happy
about how his team is doing. Ed pulls Wilma aside.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Take off the brace. You’re ready.
                    WILMA
          But I need it for my stride.
                                                               77.

                    COACH TEMPLE
          Trust me, Wilma. You’re ready to
          run without it now.
Wilma’s unsure, but hands the brace over. Ed notes Abernathy
talking to an OFFICIAL. The Official strides over.
                     OFFICIAL
          Mr. Temple, I'm going to need to
          check out your team's cleats before
          the relay.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Why's that?
                    OFFICIAL
          We need to ensure that your spikes
          comply with indoor regulations.
A wry smile crosses Ed’s lips; he recognizes this strategic
attempt by Coach Abernathy.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Alright, then. Cleats off, girls,
          so we can get back to work.
Ed hands the cleats over to the Official, never taking his
eyes off Abernathy. The Tigerbelles stand huddled together,
feeling very small in this large arena.
                    ELEANOR
          They're just trying to throw us off
          our game.
                    WILMA
          They’re trying to ice us.
                    BILLIE
          I’m too hot to be iced.
Billie licks her finger and makes a SIZZLING SOUND as she
touches her butt.
                    BILLIE (CONT’D)
          And y’all are too, for damn sure.
She touches The Tigerbelles and makes the same sizzle sound.
They all giggle, relax, and stand taller. The Official
returns to Ed with the cleats.
                    OFFICIAL
          Looks like everything checks out.
Ed collects the Tigerbelles.
                                                                78.

                    COACH TEMPLE
          Girls, they stole our lane and
          tried to stall us out. We don’t
          have the tools to beat them at
          their game, but we can certainly
          beat them at ours. Show ‘em what
          being a Tigerbelle is all about.
They put on their cleats and line up for their relay.
Eleanor is the lead off. Barbara’s 2nd, Billie’s 3rd and
Wilma’s the anchor.
Wilma looks into the Crowd, slightly nervous. Jesse catches
her eye, and motions for her to peacock. She does a few large
stretches and huge leaps to stretch. The RUNNERS next to her
watch. She is ready.
AT THE STARTING BLOCK
Eleanor takes her place at the starting block. BAM! The
pistol fires.
ELEANOR takes off, neck and neck with the Texans. There’s a
clean handoff to Barbara, who’s charged by the Crowd. She
keeps pace with the Texans and passes to Billie who...
SLIPS as she takes off. Not a huge fall but enough of a
stumble to lose ground to the Texans, who begin to gain. She
hands the baton to Wilma, who is now behind.
ED watches Wilma as she digs deep, and makes up all the
ground that Billie just lost. Through pure determination, she
crosses the line FIRST!!! It's an amazing performance. An
emphatic win. The Tigerbelles CHEER.
                    TIGERBELLES
              (at once)
          Yes! We did it! Woo-hoo!
But it's CRICKETS in the stands. WHITE SPECTATORS walk out
silently without cheering. Ed clocks this, but the
Tigerbelles are oblivious, caught up in their victory with
hugs and cheers.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Congratulations. Y’all came to New
          York and made a statement. And you,
          Wilma, you have arrived.
Wilma smiles shyly. Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor stand by
waiting to receive their individual praise, but it doesn’t
come. The smiles stiffen on their faces. A TRACK OFFICIAL
comes up to them.
                                                           79.

                    TRACK OFFICIAL
          Great job out there today. You guys
          are going to give everyone a run
          for their money in Mexico City.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          What’s in Mexico City?
                    TRACK OFFICIAL
              (surprised)
          Pan-American Games. Olympic trials.
Ed and the Tigerbelles stand, stunned by the revelation.
INT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Dishes clang and clatter as C.B. cleans up after dinner,
pissed.
                    C.B.
          No, Ed! You said New York was last.
          That’s what you promised.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          But baby, I had no way of knowing
          we would do this well.
                    C.B.
          Why is it that you’re fine to break
          a commitment to me, but not to the
          team?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Honey, that’s not it. It’s just...
          it’s the Olympic trials.
                    C.B.
          And then it’ll be the Olympics.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Exactly. Forget kissing Walter’s
          ass for a piddly job he doesn’t
          want me to have when I can be an
          Olympic coach. That’s what’s gonna
          take me to the next level.
                    C.B.
          What’s next after that, Ed? There’s
          always gonna be something with you.
This irks Ed.
                     COACH TEMPLE
          That ‘always something’ is what
          keeps us in this house. ‘Always
          something’ is what putting food on
          the table.
                                                                80.

                    C.B.
          Oh, so doing what you’re supposed
          to for your family makes it okay to
          put everybody else on the back
          burner? I swear you’re the smartest
          man I know, but that is the dumbest
          shit I’ve ever heard.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          I work this hard for us!
                    C.B.
          You work this hard for you! When is
          it gonna be your turn to have my
          back like I’ve had yours every damn
          day?! When? ‘Six more weeks?’ Or
          six more after that?
Ed throws the dishrag in the sink.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          I just need time. Why can’t you get
          that?
                    C.B.
          And I need a husband who’s gonna
          let me have my time to succeed. A
          man who doesn’t mind giving his
          time to make my dream come true.
          Now, when are you gonna get that?
He snatches his jacket and heads out before he snaps back.
INT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - LIBRARY - MORNING
Wilma re-shelves books. She glances around, then pulls a
thick LEATHER TOME off the cart. It’s an OLYMPIC HISTORY
BOOK. She flips through it.
INSERT: PHOTOS of MALE OLYMPIANS. WHITE FEMALE OLYMPIANS.
Wilma flips with purpose, then finally stops.
INSERT: A TINY PHOTO of ALICE COLEMAN, the first Black woman
to win a gold medal.
Wilma traces a finger over the gold medal. A new goal.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - DAY
TRUMPETS AND TROMBONES BLARE and DRUMS POUND as the MARCHING
BAND AND DRUM LINE train. Nearby the FOOTBALL TEAM push brand
new shiny football sleds.
Ed leads Wilma, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor away from the
track and to...
                                                             81.

EXT. EMPTY FIELD - SAME TIME
Ed stops in an empty field where the OLD JUNKED CAR sits
abandoned.
                    WILMA
          What's this?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Your new trainer.
He can’t help but to glance at the football team and their
new sleds.
         ELEANOR                          WILMA
What?                          You gotta be kidding me.
Billie and Barbara share in their dismay.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          This meet will be like no other
          meet you’ve ever gone to. We've
          gotta step up our training if we
          wanna be contenders.
                    BILLIE
              (under her breath)
          So now he wants oxes not foxes?
                    BARBARA
          He don’t even want to coach us.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          I was wrong to say that to y’all.
          That wasn’t right and to be honest,
          I wasn’t nearby true.
                    BARBARA
              (under her breath)
          Lord, hell done froze over.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          It’s not right for me to correct
          y’all when you wrong, but not call
          out myself for falling short.
The Tigerbelles all nod in agreement. Apology accepted. Ed
walks toward the abandoned car.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Now, a relay team needs to work in
          sync if they wanna win.
He pats the broken down junker.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Now get her on up on the track.e ca
                                                                82.

MONTAGE - JUNK YARD TRAINING UNDER A DRUM LINE BEAT:
-- The Girls struggle to push the car. Half of the wheels are
flat and barely turn.
-- The Girls are out of sync in their pushing of the car.
Frustrated, they BARK OUT instructions at one another.
-- The car begins to move more quickly. The Girls now more in
step with one another, but now the car needs steering.
-- Ed recruits a SKINNY MARCHING BAND MEMBER from a LINEUP of
STUDENTS that range from a RAIL-THIN WOODWIND PLAYER to a
GIGANTIC TUBA PLAYER.
-- The Skinny Marching Band Member steers the clunker as the
Tigerbelles pull it around the track.
-- More MARCHING BAND MEMBERS are inside the car as the Girls
continue to pull it around the track.
POV FROM INSIDE THE CAR: The Marching Band Members excitedly
check out the Girls’ butts as they pull the clunker around
the track. Billie turns around, catching them. She hikes her
shorts up a little higher to really give them a show.
-- President Davis watches skeptically from the sidelines.
-- Ed brings over the GIGANTIC TUBA PLAYER.
                    BARBARA
          Oh no, I'm not pushing Tubby.
                    WILMA
          C’mon, y’all. Let's just do it.
-- The Tigerbelles pull the packed car, complete with the
Tuba Player. It's slow going. A CROWD, including Jesse, have
gathered to watch. The Tuba Player plays his instrument out
the top of the car; the SLOW TOOTS match the pace of the car
being pulled.
-- As the car gains speed, Ed sends more BAND MEMBERS to jump
on the car. The Tigerbelles continue to gain speed as TUBA
BEAT QUICKENS. They complete their lap! They jump on the hood
as the CROWD CHEERS them on.
Ed’s proud, but tries to hide it. President Davis approaches
with intense heat.
                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          Ed, this training... it’s just not
          appropriate for young ladies!
                     COACH TEMPLE
          They’re athletes, sir. They have to
          be strong.
                                                               83.

                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          Pulling around scrap metal? Toting
          around men? It doesn’t look right,
          and you are putting their fertility
          in jeopardy.
Ed shakes his head at Davis.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          My girls aren’t thinking about
          children right now. They’re focused
          on studying and breaking that tape.
                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          Exactly. And that’s why I need to
          make sure I am thinking about their
          long term well-being.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          You mean the university’s well-
          being.

Taken aback by Ed’s audacity, his eyes dig into Ed.
                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          I’m putting a stop to this.
President Davis, irritated, walks off in a huff.
EXT. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH, CAPITOL HILL (NASHVILLE) - DAY
A CHOIR SINGS. C.B. sings along as Ed sits next to her.
Wilma, Barbara, and Eleanor are by his side; they’re in full
on “fox” mode. Billie slides in late with sunglasses,
grinning at Eleanor.
                    ELEANOR
              (under her breath)
          From the pub to the pews.
Several pews away, President Davis and his dignified wife,
MARY, sing along in a very reserved manner. The choir
selection ends and the PASTOR takes the pulpit.
                    PASTOR
          Amen! Glory be to Him. Can you feel
          His love? For those of y’all who
          don’t know, we got some joyful news
          last weekend.
              (nods to Coach Temple)
          Our own Brother Temple and his
          Tigerbelles brought home a big win.
          These young ladies are the first
          women's Negro college team to win a
          national championship--
                                                                84.

                    COACH TEMPLE
              (yelling from the pews)
          --First Negro team period!
                    PASTOR
              (chuckles)
          Amen! Brother Temple, c’mon up here
          and spread the good word?
Ed heads to the pulpit.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          I truly believe God has a larger
          purpose for these young ladies.
          See, this here is bigger than
          banners. Bigger than medals. Bigger
          than the school name that’s on
          their uniforms.
Members of the Congregation nods.
                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          These girls are the only Black
          faces some of these track meets
          have ever seen. And that’s why this
          is bigger than track, cause these
          girls represent all of us.
              (beat)
          I don’t have to tell y’all that
          some folks don’t wanna see us.
Ed glances over at Davis. He clenches his teeth, closely
monitoring Ed.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          But when you have a light you don’t
          hide it in a bushel, you shine it.
The Mother Board lead the way with “Amens.”
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Now there’s another competition on
          the horizon in Mexico City. It’s
          the step we need to qualify for The
          Olympics so the world can see. But
          we need help to shine brightly. If
          the world is gonna see these
          ladies, we need to make sure they
          see that greatness.
He looks around, trying to figure out his next move. He spots
MRS. ENDICOTT, 60, stern looking, refined woman.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Mrs. Endicott over there has been
          raising up women to show their
          greatness through finer womanhood.

                                                               85.

                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          I know many of our wives came up
          through Mrs. Endicott.
The Deacons throw their hands in the air to echo this fact.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          She showed ‘em grace and etiquette.
The CONGREGATION stirs in excitement.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Mrs. Endicott, would you keep on
          that work and help train up our
          girls for that world stage?
Mrs. Endicott primly stands, proud.
                    MRS. ENDICOTT
          Yes, I will.
People APPLAUD and CHEER.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Amen!
Davis shifts in his seat. A DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMEN rises to
his feet.
                     DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN
          I'd be happy to assist with the
          fundraising. Y’all are gonna need
          more than another fish fry to get
          to Mexico.
                    PASTOR
          Hallelujah.
Feeling moved, Mary stands up. Davis stares at her, shocked.
                    MARY
          And Walter and I would be happy to
          help get ‘em new uniforms!
Ed shoots a coy grin Davis’ way. Davis looks like he could
strangle Ed, but puts on a forced smile for the stirred up
church.
HANDS shoot up in the air as the Congregation offers their
services. Ed’s humbled and pleased. The Choir starts SINGING
as a collection plate is passed.
EXT. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH, CAPITOL HILL - LATER
President Davis catches Ed as the Tigerbelles chat politely
with fawning Congregants nearby.
                                                             86.

                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          That was a tactical ambush, Ed.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Had to be done.
                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          We are supposed to be moving our
          student body away from stereotypes.
          Broadening the way the world sees
          Negroes--
                    COACH TEMPLE
          --Walter, these girls are doing
          just that. They aren’t just the
          best college runners. Not just the
          best Negro runners. They’re the
          best American runners in the
          country. Maybe even the world.
                     PRESIDENT DAVIS
          Olympic coaches get paid in pride.
          You think you can survive on pride
          alone, Ed?
Ed reads between the lines.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          What are you trying to say?
                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          You’d just better hope you make
          this Olympic thing happen.
          Otherwise, you won’t have to worry
          about Marvin coaching the men.
          Cause you won’t be coaching or
          teaching anybody else... definitely
          not at TSU.
The stakes land on him as Davis leaves with a steely gaze.
EXT. MEXICO CITY AIRPORT - TARMAC - DAY
Various PASSENGERS debark the Boeing 707. Ed’s flanked by
Wilma, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor. The ladies done their
smart suits of all colors, pill box hats, gloves, and
carrying hat boxes. They turn all heads in the airport.
EXT. MEXICO CITY AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER
Ed leads the Tigerbelles to the curb, where there’s a SIGN
that says: PAN-AMERICAN GAMES - COACH TEMPLE & THE
TIGERBELLES. A suited HOSPITALITY AGENT holds it next to a
pristine CHRYSLER IMPERIAL LIMO.
                    BILLIE
          Now that’s what I’m talking ‘bout.
                                                               87.

                    BARBARA
          Finally got a ride as fine as me.
The Tigerbelles are giddy with delight. Hell, Ed is too. The
DRIVER opens the door for them.
                    COACH TEMPLE
              (perfect pronunciation)
          Buenas tardes. ¿Cómo está su día?
The Girls nudge each other, impressed with their coach.
                    DRIVER
          Mi día es un gran agradecimiento,
          señor.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Bueno escuchar que. Gracias.
I/E. LIMO / EXT. MEXICO CITY - MOMENTS LATER
Wilma, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor are glued to the window,
staring out in wonderment at the city. Modernity, colorful,
Spanish style buildings, lively. Even Ed stops doing
paperwork to take in the sights.
                    NEWS ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Athletes arriving in Mexico City
          today for the start of the Pan
          American Games.
EXT. CAMINO REAL HOTEL - DAY
The limo pulls up to an upscale and grand hotel. As Ed and
the Tigerbelles get out of the car, they can’t help but to
note the ATHLETES at the hotel... it’s NOT SEGREGATED.
                    NEWS ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          These week-long games are Olympic
          qualifiers, and will determine the
          national teams for this summer’s
          Olympics in Rome.
Cute MEXICAN GUYS pass by sharing seductive smiles at Billie
and the Tigerbelles. Eleanor throws her a warning glance.
                    BILLIE
          I know, I know Eleanor. I’m here to
          focus.
Eleanor relaxes and looks away. Billie steals a glance over
her shoulder, ogling the butt of one of the GUYS. Her eyes
tilt up and sees he has been doing the same to her.
                    BILLIE (CONT’D)
              (to herself)
          Lord, gimme strength.
                                                                88.

EXT. MEXICO CITY STREETS - DAY
-- The Tigerbelles carry shopping bags as they laugh and
talk. Enjoying this adventure.
-- MEN flirt with them as they sit at a restaurant... they
flirt back. Even Eleanor tucks her flashcards back in her
purse, overtaken by the experience.
-- The Tigerbelles eat fresh coconut and elotes.
-- Barbara puts a few Mexican COMBS in Wilma’s hair and gives
her the seal of approval. Wilma buys the combs and a DOLL.
END MONTAGE
INT. CAMINO REAL HOTEL - LOUNGE - NIGHT
Ed’s at an International Coaches Gathering. The room hums
with casual conversation as HOTEL WAITERS deliver drinks. Ed
sits with other Coaches, socializing. He’s an equal here.
INT. CAMINO REAL HOTEL - BALLROOM - SAME TIME
Wilma, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor sit in room full of
gorgeous YOUNG ATHLETES from all nations.
                    BARBARA
          That boy did not say that, Billie.
                    BILLIE
          Swear to God.
                    ELEANOR
          You can’t even speak Spanish.
                    BILLIE
          Attraction has its own translation.
They LAUGH. Wilma peeks over at the clock in the distance.
                    WILMA
          Oh, dang. I forgot I’ve gotta make
          to phone call. I’ll be back.
                    ELEANOR
          Okay.
As Wilma walks out, a LARGE RADIO is wheeled by her. A WORKER
plugs it in. BALLROOM MUSIC begins to PLAY. Barbara sways to
the music, but Billie and Eleanor aren’t really feeling it.
                    BARBARA
          This makes me miss Jack-and-Jill.
                                                               89.

                    BILLIE
          Girl, if you brag about that stupid
          club one more time... I’m gonna
          tell you something. You ain’t no
          aristocrat... you a faux-ristocrat.
Eleanor almost spits out her drink in laughter, thoroughly
amused.
                    BARBARA
          Whatever. But isn’t this a blast?
                    BILLIE
          ‘A blast?’ Are you 70? You’ve been
          watching too much Ed Sullivan, BJ.
Billie rolls her eyes at the ballroom music as it swells.
                    BILLIE (CONT'D)
          Hell, my grandmama don’t even
          listen to this music.
Billie goes to the radio and nods to the ATHLETE next to it.
                    BILLIE (CONT’D)
          Mind if I change the channel?
She surfs the dial until she finds "Don’t Let Go" by Roy
Hamilton. She and Barbara start to dance.
                    BARBARA
              (to other Athletes)
          Vamanos muchachos!
Other INTERNATIONAL ATHLETES join in. It’s infectious, even
Eleanor does a move or two.
INT. CAMINO REAL HOTEL - PHONE BOOTH - SAME TIME
The combs Wilma bought gleam as brightly in her hair as does
the smile on her face.
                    WILMA
              (into phone)
          Hey! It’s me, Charlene! How y’all
          doing... what’s wrong?
Wilma’s face falls, her eyes fill with worry.
                    WILMA (CONT’D)
          Did you call the doctor?
Wilma bites her lip in anticipation.
                    WILMA (CONT’D)
          But I can’t come home right now.

                    WILMA (CONT’D)
          Are you sure? Okay, well call me of
          anything changes.
Wilma hangs up and thinks. She faces a difficult decision.
INT. CAMINO REAL HOTEL - BALLROOM - SAME TIME
The dancing Tigerbelles are at the center of a raucous dance
party. Everyone’s having the time of their life until...
                    COACH TEMPLE (O.S.)
          Girls. Girls! Tigerbelles!!!
Ed wades through the gyrating BODIES on the dance floor.
Eleanor tugs at Barbara to show her an incoming Ed. Billie
doesn’t see a thing, that is until Ed pulls her to the side.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Eleanor, you’re supposed to be
          watching these girls! I can’t
          believe y’all are wearing out your
          legs like that the night before a
          race! In here jitterbugging like
          some jumping beans!
Wilma enters from the phone booth.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          And where have you been?
                    WILMA
          I... I... had to call home.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          I’m glad someone on this team ain’t
          out here acting a fool.
Barbara and Billie glare at Wilma... as does Eleanor. Wilma’s
so deep in thought she doesn’t even notice any of this.
                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Party’s over. Get in your rooms.
          We have a lot on the line tomorrow.
          I need you on time, in the lobby,
          looking spick-and-span from head-to-
          toe. Move!
With final dirty looks to Wilma, the rest of The Tigerbelles
leave the banquet hall.
INT. CAMINO REAL HOTEL - ROOM - MORNING
Room service breakfast is on the table. Eleanor removes the
BIG PINK CURLERS out of her hair, and piles them on the
table. Barbara uses HOT CURLERS on Billie’s hair.
                                                                91.

                    BILLIE
          I don’t care if she’s faster. All I
          know is I’m sick and tired of--
Wilma enters from the bathroom, freshly showered. Billie goes
quiet, but her bitter eye cutting doesn’t.
                     WILMA
          Morning.
                    ELEANOR
              (a bit cold)
          Good morning, Wilma.
Wilma’s hair is still undone. She looks at the curlers.
                    WILMA
          How long until you hand those off?
          The last thing I need today is
          Coach lecturing about my
          appearance.
                    BARBARA
          Oh, it shouldn’t take long. I’m
          after Billie, and you know I’ve got
          the good stuff, so it’ll curl
          quickly.
Eleanor rolls her eyes at Barbara’s comment.
                     WILMA
          Well, maybe I should go first in
          that case?
Barbara and Billie share a secret sidelong glance.
                    BILLIE
          We already started. Don’t worry.
          It won’t be long.
                    WILMA
          Billie, please, you know how Coach
          gets about our hair.
                    BARBARA
          Anyways... did you see that cute
          Italian runner last night?
                    BILLIE
          Hmm-hmm. They sure don’t have any
          hang-ups over here. I’d be the
          coffee to his cream any day.
Barbara finishes curling Billie’s hair. She starts to curl
her own hair, but at a snail’s pace. Wilma pours herself a
bowl of cereal and sits at the table, anxiously eyeing
Barbara’s hair in the curlers.
                                                                92.

Barbara inspects a section of hair. Wilma watches hopefully.
                    BARBARA
          I’m sorry. It’s taking longer than
          usual for some reason. I don’t
          think my hair likes this Mexican
          weather.
Barbara and Billie sly eye each other. Wilma looks in the
mirror, concerned. What’s she going to do?
EXT. CAMINO REAL HOTEL - LATER
Ed stares at his watch, waiting as Barbara, Billie, and
Eleanor come out of the lobby. He looks down the line of
Girls, all immaculately groomed. Suddenly, Wilma steps out of
the hotel wearing a HEAD SCARF. His eyes broaden. Billie and
Barbara smirk with satisfaction.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Skeeter! What in God’s name?
                    WILMA
          Coach, I ran out of time.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Take that mess off before someone
          sees you!
Wilma takes the scarf off and reveals her unkempt hair.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Lord To-day! This child trying to
          kill me dead.
              (huffs)
          Skeeter, hurry up and cover that
          head up. Folks are gonna think you
          haven’t had one lick of home-
          training.
Wilma quickly re-ties the scarf under her neck a la Grace
Kelly. Meanwhile, Barbara and Billie are enjoying every
minute of his explosion. Some REPORTERS approach them.
                     ITALIAN REPORTER
          Coach Temple! Italian Press. Can we
          get a quick picture and ask some
          questions?
Barbara and Billie primp in preparation.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          We’re about to leave, guys.
                    ITALIAN REPORTER
          It won’t take long. We just have a
          couple of questions.
                                                               93.

                    BARBARA
          About time.
Barbara and Billie step forward, even Eleanor has a slight
smile. The Italian Reporter turns to Wilma, ignoring them.
                       ITALIAN REPORTER
          For Wilma.
                    WILMA
              (shocked)
          For me?
Embarrassed, pissed, and pushed aside, Barbara, Billie, and
Eleanor fall into the background.
                    ITALIAN REPORTER
          Yes. The Italians have been
          following Olympic hopefuls from
          around the world very closely. ‘La
          Gazzella Nera.’ That’s what we call
          you in Italy.
                    WILMA
              (to Coach Temple)
          What’s that mean?
                    ITALIAN REPORTER
          ‘The Black Gazelle.’
Ed hesitantly nods for her to go on. Wilma touches her scarf
self-consciously as she’s pulled away by Reporters. Barbara
and Billie glower; Eleanor’s a little bit jealous.
                    BARBARA
          We should change our name to ‘The
          Wilma Rudolph Show featuring The
          Tigerbelles.’
                    BILLIE
          Let’s see how good her solo sounds
          without her backup.
EXT. UNIVERSITY STADIUM - TRACK - DAY
The Tigerbelles take their places around the track for the
relay.
                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Up next we have the highly
          anticipated 4x100 relays.
First Eleanor, then Barbara, followed by Billie, with Wilma
running as anchor.
                                                               94.

                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          The Americans are anchored by Wilma
          Rudolph, who took first in both the
          100 and 200 meter events earlier
          yesterday.
They look at the competition. PANAMANIANS, ARGENTINIANS,
CANADIANS, all strong-looking athletes.
                                              INTERCUT WITH:
INT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
C.B. listens to the RADIO as she organizes boxes of books.
                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          The stakes are high as only the top
          three teams will compete in Rome
          this summer at the Olympics...
EXT. UNIVERSITY STADIUM - TRACK - SAME TIME
Ed looks over and sees the CANADIAN and PANAMANIAN COACHES.
They meet his gaze with world-class game-faces.
BANG! Eleanor bounds from the blocks.
                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          American Eleanor Williams, first
          out of the blocks, can’t create any
          distance. Right on her heels is
          Carlota Gooden of Panama. And now
          we have the first hand off...
Eleanor hands the baton to Barbara who takes off, but not
nearly as fast as we’ve seen her go.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Barbara! Pick up the pace! Chest
          up! Stride!
                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Panama’s Jean Holmes-Mitchell is
          closing in on the Americans! It is
          still a battle for first between
          the US and Panama with the
          Canadians following closely behind.
INT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
C.B. stops organizing, drawn in by the race.
EXT. UNIVERSITY STADIUM - TRACK - SAME TIME
The Panamanians hand off the baton a split-second before the
Tigerbelles.
                                                                95.

Barbara hands the baton to Billie, who also takes off at less
than top speed. Ed’s losing his mind as he crumpling the
paper in his hands.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          What is going on?! You’re running
          like you’re in quicksand!
                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          And the Panamanians pull away in
          this third leg! In a surprising
          turn of events, the Americans slip
          into second and seem to have no
          answers for this Panamanian
          machine. With Silvia Hunte closing
          for the Panamanians, it would take
          nothing short of a miracle from
          ‘The Black Gazelle’ to save the
          day.
Wilma makes a valiant effort to catch up. She passes FOUR
RUNNERS, but isn’t able to make up enough ground to catch 1st
or 2nd place. The Tigerbelles place 3rd in a PHOTO FINISH.
                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          And there we have it! Silvia Hunte
          secures a place at the Olympic
          table for the Panamanians. In
          second place, we have the
          Canadians, and with a surprising
          and disappointing showing, the
          Americans just barely secure third
          place in this race.
Ed throws his notebook to the ground.
                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          This team just did not look
          together today and this might not
          bode well for them in Rome.
INT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
C.B. turns the radio off and slumps in a chair.
EXT. UNIVERSITY STADIUM - STAGING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Billie nonchalantly chews gum as Barbara takes off her
cleats. Eleanor wipes off sweat as Wilma sits with her head
in her hands. Ed towers over them, livid.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          What the hell was that? You looked
          a mess out there today. If it were
          not for Skeeter digging deep...
                                                                96.

                    BILLIE
          Here we go again.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Long as you out there taking
          strolls out there on that track,
          you deadgum right here we go again.
                    BARBARA
          No, here we go again with ‘Skeeter
          can do no wrong.’ She’s ‘pretty’
          and ‘leggy’ and ‘perfect.’
                    COACH TEMPLE
          This is not about looks. This is
          about performance. And the two of
          you have let this team down.
                    BILLIE
          Team? This ain’t no team!
                    BARBARA
          The team don’t get no interviews.
                    BILLIE
          We need to call this what it really
          is... ‘Wilma Rudolph and the three
          also-rans.’
Billie and Barbara’s scowls finally click for Wilma. Her brow
slowly furrows.
                    WILMA
          So that’s why y’all wouldn’t let me
          use the curlers this morning?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          That’s why your hair was a mess?
Wilma gets closer to Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor.
                    WILMA
          Y’all got mad cause you ain’t
          getting interviews? I didn’t ask
          for any of this.
                     BARBARA
          But you’re not turning it down
          neither. And you’re definitely not
          turning down Coach’s special
          treatment.
Maintaining calm, Ed tries to bring this down to a simmer.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          My rules are concrete, BJ. I treat
          all my runners the same.
                                                               97.

Lips pursed, Billie and Barbara stare at Ed like he’s crazy.
                    BARBARA
          ‘Tell the truth, shame the devil.’
                     BILLIE
          Eleanor?
Billie cuts her eyes so deep into Eleanor, that she can’t
help but to speak out.
                    ELEANOR
          You don’t always treat us the same.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Now, that’s not tr--
                    BILLIE
          --Me and BJ get busted when we
          break the rules, but Skeeter’s free
          to run around with her boyfriend at
          all hours of the night.
                    WILMA
          I was studying! I actually need
          good grades, Billie.
Ed holds up his hands to pause their back and forth.
                    COACH TEMPLE
              (connecting the dots)
          Eleanor, did you know about the
          shenanigans going on with them?
Eleanor swallows hard with her teammates’ eyes on her.
                    ELEANOR
          The curlers, yes. But I didn’t know
          Billie and BJ were going to throw
          the race.
Ed stops short... never did this even cross his mind. He
turns to Billie and Barbara.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Are you telling me y’all just lost
          that race on purpose?

They stay silent for a beat then--

                    BARBARA
          We were never gonna throw away our
          shot at the Olympics.

Ed shakes his head in disbelief.
                                                      98.


                    BILLIE
          But you and Skeeter needed a
          reminder that taking first place
          means y’all need us too.

Wilma’s uncorked and angry. It’s all coming out.
                    WILMA
          After all the bruises and aches,
          all the sacrifices, after all the
          time we put in... y’all throw the
          race over curfew and interviews?
          This ain’t a game.
                    ELEANOR
          I’m not playing games.
                    WILMA
          You might not be in their game,
          Eleanor, but you’re on the
          sidelines letting it happen. None
          of y’all might not mind treating
          class and track like we in grade
          school, but I need this.
                    BILLIE
          Hold up, now. I’ve put in so much
          sweat, I’ve done damn near flooded
          most of Nashville.
                    WILMA
          And that sweat shoulda took us on
          to victory, but you let it drown us
          instead! Don’t y’all see that?
Livid, Wilma rushes to pack her things.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Where you going?
                    WILMA
          Home.
                    ELEANOR
          You can’t leave.
                    WILMA
          What’s the point of staying?
Wilma slings her bag across her body.
                    BILLIE
          Ain’t nothing back home but
          chiggers, fire ants, and--
Fed up, Wilma’s had enough and finally lets it out.
                                                             99.

                    WILMA
          --My child.
Ed, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor are gut-punched.
                    ELEANOR
          You have a baby?
                    BARBARA
              (softened)
          Skeeter?
Regret billows Billie’s once stiffened demeanor.
                    BILLIE
          Why ain’t you tell us?
                    WILMA
          Cause you like pouring water on a
          drowning woman. Y’all might not
          need me, but my daughter does. And
          now she’s sick at home I’m here
          fighting about hair and chasing
          folks around a track.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Skeeter, you shoulda come and
          talked to me--
                    WILMA
          --‘No mothers on the track,’ ain’t
          that the rule?
              (trails off near tears)
          This is nonsense. I’m done.
Wilma storms off upset, leaving them with dropped jaws.
INT. WILMA’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Robert gently walks up with Yolanda. Wilma rushes to take
Yolanda in his arms. Charlene watches Wilma feel Yolanda’s
forehead testing for a fever.
                    WILMA
          Is she okay?
Yolanda CRIES as Wilma holds her tightly.
                    CHARLENE
          It was a pretty scary fever.

                    ROBERT
          It was a little touch and go for a
          while, but it came down.
Wilma’s touch doesn’t soothe Yolanda, who reaches out for
Charlene.
                                                                100.

                    CHARLENE
              (to Yolanda)
          It’s okay. Stay with your mama.
Wilma’s heart is breaking. Her tears come pouring.
Comforting, Robert lovingly rubs Wilma’s back.
                    WILMA
          I shoulda stayed here.

Robert parts his mouth to speak, but Charlene puts her hand
to halt his words. She’s got this.
                    CHARLENE
          It wouldn’t have stop nothing.
                    WILMA
          But what was it all for? A child
          who doesn’t even know me? For so-
          called teammates to stab me in the
          back? I call myself doing what I
          thought I had to do. And it still
          wasn’t good enough.
Wilma pulls the DOLL FROM MEXICO out and gives it to Yolanda.
She holds her tight and rocks her, trying to comfort both her
baby and herself.
EXT. WILMA’S HOUSE - PORCH - DAY
Charlene sits next to a massive pile of laundry, scrubbing
clothes in a tub by hand. The YOUNG GIRLS help by creating an
assembly line that ends at the clothesline. Wilma enters with
Yolanda, eyes the laundry.
                    WILMA
          Y’all didn’t have to do my washing.
                    CHARLENE
          I just threw it in with the rest.
          We’re all helping Mama with the
          laundry anyway.
A silent beat off the reality of her family’s work life.
                    CHARLENE (CONT’D)
          Skeeter, what you doing with this
          track business? You started out
          running to help pay for school. Now
          it’s turned into something else.
Wilma picks up some clothes and starts folding.
                    WILMA
          I don’t know what I’m doing. I
          never expected it would go this
          far.
                    (MORE)
                                                             101.

                     WILMA (CONT'D)
          The thing is I’m good at this,
          Charlene. It feels nice to finally
          be good at something. But no team
          means no Olympics.
              (then)
          It ain’t like I can make a living
          from running no way. Even Jesse
          Owens couldn’t make a living off it
          without racing horses and dogs for
          white folks like he was the animal.
Wilma scoffs at the lunacy of this fact.
                    WILMA (CONT’D)
          Sad part is to even get that kind
          of humiliation or to even get a
          fighting chance, you gotta be man.
                    CHARLENE
          But men ain’t mothers. Mothers are
          strong, Skeeter.
                     WILMA
          Yeah and mothers know how to
          sacrifice, which I haven’t been
          doing. Mama toted me around for
          years when I was sick. And it took
          me two days to get home to my
          child. Just think how I would’ve
          felt if that fever didn’t break. No
          gold medal could’ve fixed that.
              (beat)
          ‘Feeling nice’ is a luxury. I need
          to go back to school and focus on
          school. Graduate. Get a good job
          and take care of my baby.
Wilma grabs the laundry basket and goes inside leaving
Charlene at a loss.
EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - DAY
Ed glances at his watch as he walks toward the track. Only
Eleanor is there.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Where is everyone?
                    ELEANOR
          Off somewhere mad at you.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          And you’re not?
Eleanor looks away, not answering.
                                                                102.

                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Take a rest day, Eleanor.
She walks away without making eye contact. Ed looks across at
the men’s field. President Davis approaches.
                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          Temple! No training today?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          I gave the girls the day off.
                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          And well deserved. I believe
          congratulations are due. The
          Olympics! You have done more with
          the Tigerbelles than me or anyone
          else could have ever expected.
It’s difficult for Ed to take this as a compliment.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Well, thank you, Walter.
                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          It pains me a little to say it, but
          you were right. TSU is on the lips
          of people all around this country.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          The girls worked really hard. You
          couldn’t ask for better
          representatives of this school.
                    PRESIDENT DAVIS
          I know. And you’re the reason for
          their success. It’s because of
          that, that I’ve made a decision.
E/I. IMPOVERISHED SCHOOL - LIBRARY - EVENING
Ed stands outside of a window and gazing inside.
ED’S POV: C.B. is amongst a group of VOLUNTEER LITERACY
WORKERS from her church. CHILDREN sit at tables with books.
C.B. is helping one of them with their reading.
Ed comes inside, slowly crossing to C.B.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          It looks really good in here. I’m
          really proud of what you’ve done
          with these kids. A lot of elbow
          grease.
There’s distance and tension in the air.
                                                         103.

                    C.B.
          When it’s what you’re meant to do,
          it doesn’t even feel like work.
          You know that.
He nods in response. He takes a deep breath.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Can we talk?
EXT. IMPOVERISHED SCHOOL - SCHOOL YARD - MOMENTS LATER
C.B. leans against the Merry-Go-Round as Ed paces.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Walter offered me the men’s
          coaching job.
                    C.B.
          What’d you tell him?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Given I’ve got no girls on the team
          left to coach, looks like the
          decision’s been made for me.
          Everybody but Eleanor quit.
                    C.B.
          What?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          They don’t know any better. But I
          can’t let the girls’ squander their
          opportunity.
                    C.B.
          You mean your opportunity.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          This isn’t about me, C.B.
                    C.B.
          It’s always about you.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          You just talking nonsense now.
                    C.B.
          You’re selfish.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Me? Selfish?
                                                                104.

                    C.B.
          I love you, so I won’t lie. Yes.
          You’re so focused on getting
          Marvin’s job, on getting to the
          trials, on getting to the Olympics
          that you aren’t focused on seeing
          on those girls.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          I see them.
                    C.B.
          You know every piece of food they
          eat, but you didn’t even know
          Skeeter had a whole baby at home.
He takes a deep breath. There’s truth in these words.
                    C.B. (CONT’D)
          You work so hard to make up for
          what you couldn’t get on that track
          years ago, that you can’t see what
          or who is right in front of you.
Ed absorbs the hard blow. Something hits him. He takes a seat
on the nearby swing.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          I wanna see those girls get what I
          wasn’t good enough to achieve.
C.B. joins him on the swing set.
                    C.B.
          You’re good enough, Ed. You always
          have been. You just let pride get
          in the way.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          And that pride made me let you
          down. I preach excellence, but have
          given you mediocrity. You don’t
          deserve nothing less than the best.
Ed grabs her hand, holds it lovingly.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT'D)
          But when you know better, you do
          better, right?
She nods gently stroking his hand.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          So what time do I need to be here
          in the morning?
C.B.’s confused.
                                                                105.

                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          To teach. These kids shouldn’t have
          to wait until high school to learn
          social studies.
C.B. gives him a warm kiss. They’re on track to heal.
                     C.B.
          Thank you, Ed. Really.
              (then)
          You’ve worked too hard to get where
          you are. Those girls have worked
          too hard. They need you and you
          need them. You’ve got to make this
          right... with everyone.
C.B.’s wise words land on him.
INT. WILMA’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
The house is quiet. Wilma wakes up with her Yolanda curled up
close. She takes a deep whiff of her sleeping baby’s head.
Wilma opens a closet. Inside are the LEG BRACES of various
sizes she wore as a child. She picks up a brace and turns it
over in her hands, and fingering the scuffs and scrapes.
EXT. WILMA’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Wilma stares at the PARALLEL BARS her family built years ago.
She walks to them. She looks over her shoulder to find
Charlene watching her. They lock eyes. Wilma makes the
FIGHTER FIST from their childhood. Charlene does it back.
Wilma stares out into the open field ahead of her. One step
in front of the other... until she picks up speed.
EXT. FIELDS - SAME TIME
Wilma runs slowly at first, then she melds into the green
scenery behind her as she pumps her arms faster and her legs
carry her away. She is revived. She was born to do this!
She stops to catch her breath. She finds a familiar STATION
WAGON parked up ahead. Ed sits on the hood.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          We really got that stride evened
          out, didn’t we?
Surprised, Wilma self-consciously pats her hair into place
and straightens her clothes.
                    WILMA
          Hey, Coach. I wasn’t expecting--
                                                              106.

                    COACH TEMPLE
          --I was in the mood for a drive and
          this is where I ended up.
Wilma smiles at his excuse. They look out onto the fields.
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          You know, I ran for TSU. Not as
          good as you girls, but I was good.
          I never really made my mark there,
          so I thought I could make it
          coaching. If I’m being honest, I
          wasn’t happy when they stuck me
          with the girls’ team.
                    WILMA
          Yeah, you already told us you
          didn’t want us.
Ed holds up his hand, he’s not finished.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Like I said, I was wrong ‘bout
          that. Up until this season, that’s
          how it felt.
                    WILMA
          What changed?
                    COACH TEMPLE
          I’m starting to realize that
          sometimes what we think we want
          shouts so loud that it drowns out
          what we are made to do.
Wilma thinks over his words. She becomes fully aware of why
he’s there.
                    WILMA
          I was made to be my baby’s mother.
          There’s no changing that.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Listen, Skeeter, I’m not
          downplaying your responsibilities
          here. Believe me, I’m not. But
          you’re made to do something
          remarkable in this lifetime. Every
          time the world has tried to topple
          you over, your destiny sets you
          back upright. Don’t underestimate
          the importance of what you girls
          are doing out there on that track.
          I know I’m not going to.
Wilma takes this in.
                                                                107.

                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          President Davis offered me the
          men’s coaching job. But no matter
          what you decide, my decision has
          been made. I’m taking the
          Tigerbelles all the way.
Ed turns to leave, but can’t help himself...
                    COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
          Your hands are passing your body
          too low. You better get ‘em up to
          the hips if you plan to beat the
          West Germans.
Wilma chuckles to herself. Ed hops in his car and drives off.
EXT. DOWNTOWN NASHVILLE - DAY
The BLACK LABOR DAY PARADE is in full effect. The TENNESSEE
STATE UNIVERSITY BAND break into a dance, amping up the
CROWD. CHEERLEADERS flip and twirl.
An ornate TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY FLOAT rolls by with
Jesse and the rest of the FOOTBALL TEAM as the main event.
President Davis’s also aboard waving to the Crowd.
Meanwhile, a modest CONVERTIBLE carrying a PATHETIC BANNER
that simply reads, TIGERBELLES, is transporting Eleanor. Yet,
she’s the only Tigerbelle in attendance.
IN THE CROWD
Barbara stands with the AKAs. She can’t help but to see the
TIGERBELLES FLOAT. Eleanor looks downright miserable. A few
AKAs snicker about the poor sight. Suddenly, Barbara sprints
for the convertible.
AT THE CONVERTIBLE
Barbara leaps into the slow creeping car. Eleanor’s shocked.
                    ELEANOR
          What are you doing?
                    BARBARA
          I couldn’t leave you in front of
          this crowd all by yourself.
              (joking)
          They expect some showmanship.
Eleanor brightens and hugs her. Barbara waves to the Crowd
like a beauty queen.
                                                                108.

                    ELEANOR
          Well, we might as well enjoy our
          moment in the sun. This is as close
          as we’re going to get to it.
                    WILMA (O.S.)
          Barbara! Eleanor!
They look over into the Crowd and see Wilma waving them over.
                                                TIME CUT TO:
THE END OF THE PARADE ROUTE
Barbara and Eleanor make their way through the Crowd of
people and floats at the end of the parade. They finally
connect with Wilma.
                    WILMA
          Come help with these autographs.
                    BARBARA
          What autographs?
Wilma points to a bunch of cheering, enthusiastic YOUNG
GIRLS. They’re part of C.B.’s literacy group. Ed and C.B. are
amidst the kids.
Eleanor and Barbara stand in awe reading the HANDWRITTEN
SIGNS the Girls are holding: GO FOR GOLD! TIGERBELLES ARE
SWELL! GO TEAM TIGERBELLES!
                    ELEANOR
          Does this mean what I think it
          does?
                    WILMA
          It’s the Olympics. And we gotta
          real chance to win.
Barbara puts a loving hand on Wilma’s arm.
                    BARBARA
          I’m sorry. We let our team down.
                    ELEANOR
          We let you down, Skeeter.
                    BARBARA
          We didn’t know about your baby, but
          that still doesn’t make what we did
          right. Baby or not, we had no
          business acting how we did.
                    WILMA
          I shoulda let you know what was
          going on.
                    (MORE)
                                                                109.

                    WILMA (CONT'D)
          Y’all supposed to be my sisters. I
          shoulda told you. I let y’all down
          too.
This warms both Barbara and Eleanor’s hearts. A PACK of
LITERACY GIRLS holding notebooks and pens follow C.B.
                    C.B.
          Girls, I couldn’t keep ‘em away any
          longer.
Barbara and Eleanor are bombarded with attention.
                    LITERACY GIRL 1
          Is it true that y’all are the
          fastest runners in the world?
                    LITERACY GIRL 2
          I wanna go to college just like
          y’all when I grow up.
Barbara melts as she signs autographs for them.
                    BARBARA
          You will. If you’re good enough,
          you can even get a scholarship!
Eleanor and Wilma throw Barbara a playful glance. A Literacy
Girl eagerly watches Eleanor as she signs her notebook.
                     LITERACY GIRL 3
          What are you going to get a gold
          medal for?
                     ELEANOR
          I’m running the 200 and the relay.
              (then)
          But you can’t run a relay with only
          three people.
She looks up and catches the eyes of Wilma and Barbara.
INT. JUKE JOINT - NIGHT
A LIVE BAND plays for a CROWD in their 30s and 40s. Wilma,
Eleanor, and Barbara take in the cool and lively Crowd.
Eleanor locks in on the risqué, bluesy LADY SINGER, dressed
in a short sleeved button up, trousers, and suspenders,
belting out “I Want to Walk You Home” by Fats Domino.
They spot Billie holding court at a table with a slick, good-
looking OLDER MAN. Billie’s stunned to see them.
                    BILLIE
          What the...
She shoos the Older Man from the table.
                                                               110.

                    BILLIE (CONT’D)
          Did they double-book a Girl Scout
          troop meeting here tonight?
Excited by the popping energy, Barbara happily takes a seat.
                    BARBARA
          This place is cool.
                    WILMA
          Better than Jack-and-Jill?
Billie laughs at Wilma’s wisecracking.
                    WILMA (CONT’D)
          We need you back, Billie. We wanna
          go to the Olympics and we can’t win
          without you.
                    BILLIE
          ‘We?’ You back? What about your
          baby?
                    WILMA
          If I don’t do what I’m best at, how
          will she ever learn to do her best?
          Plus, I’ve got my family and Robert
          to help me.
                    BILLIE
          Your girl’s lucky. I didn’t have a
          mama like you to look up to.
                    BARBARA
          Where was she?
                    BILLIE
          She passed away when I was little.
                    ELEANOR
          Oh, Billie.
                    BILLIE
          She used to work here, but she did
          more drinking than working.
              (sips her whiskey)
          Hell, the apple don’t fall far from
          the tree.
The Girls soak her words in, seeing her for the first time.
                    WILMA
          Well, this is your chance to prove
          ‘em all wrong.
                    BARBARA
          You belong in Rome with us.
                                                                111.

                    WILMA
          Listen, Billie, running’s in my
          soul. And whether you wanna own up
          to it or not, it’s in yours too.
                    ELEANOR
          It’s in all of us. And my legs
          don’t have another four years in
          them. Don’t you steal this old
          lady’s best shot at gold.
They look to Billie, hopeful.
                      BILLIE
          Eh, okay.
Wilma, Barbara, and Eleanor beam.
                    BILLIE (CONT’D)
          Shit, I need the exercise. My hips
          starting to get as big as BJ’s.
                    BARBARA
          Never heard any complaints.
Barbara chugs the rest of Billie’s drink. They all,
especially Eleanor, stare in shock. Barbara sticks her tongue
out at Eleanor. They can’t help but to laugh.
                    BILLIE
          I was planning on that to be my
          last drink.
                    WILMA
          We’re gonna make sure it stays that
          way. You may not have no mama, but
          you still got family.
                      ELEANOR
          Us.
                      BARBARA
          Always.
Billie’s eyes water. The Girls put their hands one on top of
the other in solidarity.
The BLUES SINGER begins singing “Finger Poppin Time” by Hank
Ballard. Eleanor focuses on the Singer... again. Billie
clocks it and leans in to Eleanor.
                    BILLIE
          You ain’t no old maid after all.
The two stare at each other... a thorough but brief
conversation plays out just between their eyes. Billie winks
in support.
                                                                112.

Amends have been made. The Tigerbelles are back.

EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - EVENING
Practice has wrapped. Wilma wipes the sweat from her brow.
Jesse stands nearby watching.
                    JESSE
          You looking skinny, girl. Lemme get
          a meal in you.
                                                           113.

INT. NASHVILLE DINER - NIGHT
Wilma and Jesse sit at a booth across from each other.
                    WILMA
          Training for the Olympics is way
          more intense than I could’ve
          imagined.
                    JESSE
          Well, I’m really excited for y’all,
          but I can’t wait for things to die
          down so I can see you a little more
          often. You coming back to campus
          after you get back from Rome?
                    WILMA
          I’ve gotta go home.
                    JESSE
              (disappointed)
          To see Robert?
Wilma takes a deep breath. She has to say tell him.
                    WILMA
          Jesse, I’ve got a baby at home. My
          family keeps her while I’m here in
          Nashville... and everywhere else.
Jesse’s stunned, but tries to gather himself.
                       JESSE
          And Robert    is her daddy?
              (Wilma    nods)
          Wow. Well,    that explains a lot.
          What’s her    name?
                       WILMA
          Yolanda.
                    JESSE
          That’s a beautiful name. Sounds
          like she’s gonna be somebody. Just
          like her mama.
Jesse pulls out a SMALL GIFT wrapped in tissue paper. He
hands it to Wilma.
                    WILMA
          What’s this?
                    JESSE
          Gotta open it to find out.
She opens it and inside is a beautiful GAZELLE BROOCH.
                                                                114.

                    WILMA
          Jesse... this is beautiful.
                    JESSE
          I don’t speak Italian, but they’re
          calling you something like, ‘La
          Gazelle Negra.’
Wilma really takes in the brooch. It gleams and seems to
energize her.
                     WILMA
          ‘La Gazzella Nera.’
              (laughs to herself)
          And I thought ‘Skeeter’ was the
          only nickname I was ever gonna
          have.
              (then)
          I’m just a simple girl from
          Tennessee, Jesse.

                    JESSE
          Now the whole world knows that
          Tennessee girl. Greatness doesn’t
          care about geographical boundaries.
          It spreads all over the globe.

Wilma takes this in, grateful over what feels like a fantasy.
                    JESSE (CONT’D)
          Just don’t forget us little people
          when you win gold.
                    WILMA
          I never forget my friends.
Wilma’s clearly defined what their relationship will be,
which leaves Jesse a tad disappointed. He musters an earnest
smile. Relieved, Wilma responds in kind both appreciative of
their friendship.
EXT. ROME - VILLAGGIO OLIMPICO - DAY
Ed and the Tigerbelles weave through the plethora of
INTERNATIONAL ATHLETES in the Olympic Village. They crosses
paths with the WEST GERMAN TRACK TEAM. The GERMAN COACHES and
Ed each exchange polite nods. Wilma and Jutta each size each
other up. Their game faces on.
INT. VILLAGGIO OLIMPICO - ATHLETES’ QUARTERS - EARLY MORNING
Wilma, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor stand together in front
of a mirror doing their hair and makeup. They’re completely
in sync as they pass each other brow pencils, hair spray,
combs. Their USA uniforms are impeccable.
                                                                115.

Billie hands Wilma the hair curler. The Tigerbelles share
tender looks in the mirror. They’re in this together now.
EXT. STADIO OLIMPICO - DAY
It’s the 100M SEMI-FINALS. Barbara, Billie, Eleanor, and
Wilma jump and stretch to keep warm on the sidelines.
                    ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
          Up next we have the qualifying
          heats of the Women’s 100. Only the
          top two from each heat will advance
          to the final.
                    ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
          That’s right. And there are high
          expectations for this U.S.A. team,
          lead by Wilma Rudolph. This is one
          of the three events she is running
          at this Olympics. She stands a good
          chance to set an Olympic record by
          taking gold in all three.
Ed tightly holds his notebook in his hands. He’s got some
nerves, but puts on a brave face.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Billie, Skeeter, you’re in the
          first heat.
                    BILLIE
          Okay, Coach.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Skeeter, lane 5. Billie, lane 3.
                    BILLIE
          Let’s get it.
Billie and Wilma slap hands as they line up for a 100 heat.
BANG! They’re off. Wilma has an quick step out of the blocks.
                    ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
          And Rudolph pulls ahead of the
          pack. Rudolph continues to create
          space between herself and the rest
          of the runners...
The LANE 2 RUNNER strains to keep up with Wilma who crosses
the finish line in FIRST PLACE. The Lane 2 Runner narrowly
edges Billie out.
                    ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
          And good golly, Wilma Rudolph
          commandingly sets an Olympic
          record! 11.3 Seconds!
                                                               116.

At the finish line, Billie gives Wilma a sincere hug.
                       BILLIE
             Go get that gold, country gal.
NEXT HEAT
Barbara lines up next to a variety of EUROPEAN RUNNERS,
including DOROTHY HYMAN from England. The gun FIRES and...
Dorothy sprints to victory.
                       ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
             And Great Britain’s Dorothy Hyman
             stakes her claim in this Olympic
             games!
Barbara fights to come in THIRD. She’s disappointed, but
Eleanor is there to give her an encouraging pat.
                       ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
             Barbara Jones will not advance,
             which means Wilma Rudolph will be
             the sole U.S. competitor in the 100
             finals.
                                                   CUT TO:
100 FINALS
There’s a fully-packed, excited CROWD for the track finals.
                       ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
             We expect that these finals will be
             all Wilma Rudolph, who set a World
             Record in the qualifying heat, but
             British newcomer, Dorothy Hyman has
             been making quite a statement at
             these games thus far.
ON THE TRACK
Wilma lines up in LANE 4 next to Dorothy Hyman in LANE 5. Ed
and the Tigerbelles watch nervously from the sidelines.
Barbara, Eleanor, and Billie join hands in solidarity.
BANG! The RUNNERS explode from the blocks. WILMA pulls ahead
of the pack... she CROSSES THE FINISH LINE several strides
ahead of the closest RUNNER.
                       ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
             Wilma Rudolph takes the gold in the
             100! This showing is certainly no
             disappointment for the first ever
             televised Olympics. I can’t wait to
             see what happens in the 200 final!
                                                                117.

Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor jump up and CHEER. Ed proudly
claps his hands as the Crowd ROARS.
                    ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
          Up next, the 200 meter semi finals.
                                                     CUT TO:
SEMIFINALS 200
The CAMERA PANS past Eleanor and Wilma at the starting line
to REVEAL the intimidating JUTTA HEINE practicing her starts
with fluid precision. Wilma looks on.
                    WILMA
          She’s a machine.
Eleanor redirects Wilma’s attention.
                       ELEANOR
          So are we.
Eleanor gives Wilma a quick high-five and walks back towards
her lane to settle in the blocks.
                    ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
          This should be a great race. West
          Germany’s Jutta Heine is the best
          answer for stopping pure dominance
          from the Americans.
Wilma begins to peacock Jutta, stretching big, and doing huge
jumps, but Jutta doesn’t bite. Instead, Jutta jumps higher
and stretches bigger! Shit! Wilma is momentarily unsettled.
Wilma settles into the blocks, takes a deep breath. The gun
BANGS!
Wilma and Jutta jockey for the lead through the turn. With 50
meters to go, Wilma’s long strides create some distance.
Wilma LEANS INTO THE TAPE with Jutta a few strides behind.
The Crowd CHEERS uproariously.
                    ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
          Incredible! Rudolph not only runs
          her fastest time in this event, but
          also sets a second Olympic record!
Eleanor comes in FOURTH PLACE, but Wilma is there to give her
a congratulatory hug.
INT. VILLAGGIO OLIMPICO - ATHLETES’ QUARTERS - DAY
Ed’s laser-focused as he leans in close to Wilma.
                                                               118.

                    COACH TEMPLE
          Jutta is the one to beat. And I
          think she was holding back for the
          final. Don’t get comfortable.
                    WILMA
          I won’t, Coach.
A TALL, HANDSOME BLACK U.S. ATHLETE approaches. We recognize
him as a young...
                    CASSIUS CLAY
          Coach Temple? I just wanted to
          introduce myself. I’m Cassius Clay,
          future heavyweight champion of the
          world.
Ed happily shakes his hand.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Well, you’ve certainly got a lot of
          spunk. Hope your punch can back it
          up, son.
                    CASSIUS CLAY
              (holding his fists up)
          Look at these paws!
Cassius nods to Wilma.
                    CASSIUS CLAY (CONT’D)
          I’ve been following the
          Tigerbelles’ journey. But I really
          don’t have any choice... I always
          have to pass by y’all in the
          newspaper just to find any little
          blurb about me!
Wilma chuckles.
                    CASSIUS CLAY (CONT’D)
          And Wilma, you’re just as pretty as
          in your pictures. You feeling as
          good about your odds as me?
                    WILMA
          If it’s an odds game, I have three
          chances for gold. You have one.
                    CASSIUS CLAY
          Oooohhhh! That’s a knockout.
Ed and Wilma laugh.
EXT. STADIO OLIMPICO - DAY
Wilma and Dorothy Hyman prepare at the starting line.
                                                                 119.

                    ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
          We are standing by to see if the
          U.S. can secure another Olympic
          Gold in this 200 Meter foot race.
Jutta confidently strides onto the track. Ed eyes her
leader... COACH SCHWARZ.
The RUNNERS crouch down into their starting blocks. Jutta
sneaks a peak at Wilma, but Wilma’s got on blinders... she’s
focused straight ahead, looking at the finish line.
BANG! Jutta and Wilma both pull away from Dorothy and the rest
of the pack. They are neck-and-neck. Wilma leans into the
FINISH LINE for a close win.
                    ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
          And Rudolph picks up a second gold
          medal for the United States! There
          is simply no stopping Rudolph! She
          is one medal away from an
          unprecedented 3 track and field
          golds in a single Olympics! She
          will have her shot at history
          tomorrow with the 4x100 relay.
                    ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
          And if they win, each member of Ed
          Temple’s small little Tennessee
          college team can go home with a
          gold medal. This will certainly be
          a historic race.
The Tigerbelles run to the field to congratulate Wilma. As
they prance in celebration, Wilma’s FOOT TURNS in a hidden
HOLE in the grass.
                    WILMA
          Aaaah!
Everyone goes SILENT. Ed turns his head quickly in horror.
EXT. VILLAGGIO OLIMPICO - MEDICAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
CLOSE ON: Wilma’s heavily BRUISED and SWOLLEN ANKLE. (NOTE TO
READER: This injury actually happened).
She winces in pain as an OLYMPIC DOCTOR examines it. Wilma
watches as the Olympic Doctor speaks to Ed privately.
Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor stand by Wilma’s side. Ed
shuffles back to Wilma as the Doctor moves off.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          Well, the good news is it’s not
          broken. And the bad news is, we’re
          gonna need an alternate for the
          relay tomorrow.
                                                                120.

Wilma fights tears as the Tigerbelles console her. Ed hangs
his head in sadness.
INT. VILLAGGIO OLIMPICO - ATHLETES’ QUARTERS - NIGHT
PAN ACROSS Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor... each resting
peacefully in bed. Everybody’s sound asleep except for Wilma,
who sits up in bed, staring at her ankle.
INT. ATHLETES’ QUARTERS - BATHROOM - SAME TIME
Wilma hobbles into the bathroom. She locks the door and looks
at her legs in the mirror. Tears well in her eyes.
Outside the window, she glimpses an AMERICAN FLAG rustling in
the pre-dawn breeze. She stares at her SWOLLEN ANKLE.
INT. WILMA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Charlene, Robert, Mr. and Mrs. Rudolph, Yolanda, and the rest
of the Family gather around a brand new black and white TV.
It’s really small, but that doesn’t stop them.
                    ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
          The Tigerbelles are now preparing
          to take the track for the relay.
Charlene moves closer to the screen, squints.
                    CHARLENE
          Where’s Skeeter?
EXT. STADIO OLIMPICO - WARM-UP AREA - SAME TIME
Barbara, Eleanor, and Billie surround Ed. Everyone looks
unsettled, out of sync, but Ed presses on.
                    COACH TEMPLE
          We’re going to shuffle our lineup.
          Billie, you’ll be running anchor--
                    WILMA (O.S.)
          --No, she won’t.
All heads turn... it’s Wilma! The Team is stunned.
                    BILLIE
          What are you doing? You’re supposed
          to be in the bed.
                    WILMA
          It’s not broken. I’m running.
                    BARBARA
          But you can’t.
                                                                121.

                     ELEANOR
           You shouldn’t.
                      WILMA
           I will.
               (beat)
           I’ve spent my life listening to
           people tell me what I can’t do.
           Today, I decide. And I’m running.
The Girls look to Ed... he nods his approval.
                     COACH TEMPLE
           Skeeter’s right. And she ain’t
           alone. The world’s been telling all
           of you what you can’t do. Where
           your place is and where you could
           never go.
Ed swallows hard.
                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
           And that included me.
The Tigerbelles look up in surprise.
                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
           If any one of you had ever
           listened, none of us would be here
           right now. Hell, none of us are
           supposed to be here. But I’ve never
           been in the habit of doing what I’m
           supposed to do.
           BILLIE                        ELEANOR
Deadgum right, Coach.          Preach.
                     COACH TEMPLE
           So, let’s get that gold and put our
           name in the history books before
           they catch on.
He puts his hands in to lead a cheer, but before he can say a
word, the Girls take over. Building to a roar of excitement:
                     TIGERBELLES
           Foxes not oxes... Foxes not oxes...
           FOXES NOT OXES! GO TIGERBELLES!

Wilma’s family gathered around a TV set.
                     ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
           It looks as though Rudolph’s ankle
           is heavily taped. That doesn’t look
           good.
                                                                  122.

                      ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
            This last minute injury could keep
            Wilma from taking an unprecedented
            3rd track and field gold medal in a
            single Olympic Games.
Charlene curls Yolanda’s little hand into a fighting fist.

            C’mon, Skeeter. You got this.

            No American female athlete has been
            able to accomplish this feat.
EXT. STADIO OLIMPICO - TRACK - SAME TIME
The Tigerbelles take their places around the track. They look
to Ed, then at each other. They are ONE.
The START GUN GOES OFF!
BARBARA
Has a strong start of the blocks. Her head is down and
strides are rhythmic. She runs and perfectly passes the baton
to Eleanor. The West Germans, Polish, and Soviet Union stay
neck and neck with the Tigerbelles.
ELEANOR
Eleanor’s legs are flashes of lightning. Her breathing is
even and she is focused on Billie up ahead. She flawlessly
passes the baton to Billie; they are perfectly in sync. The
West Germans and Americans gain a slight advantage over the
other teams.
                                                                123.

BILLIE
Takes off, pumping her arms furiously. Her face displays its
normal nonchalance, but her body is working in overdrive.
She times her pace with Wilma, whose hand is outstretched
behind her, impatiently waiting for the baton. The West
Germans are closing in.
WILMA
Wilma BOBBLES the baton slightly -- the pass is not clean.
Jutta receives the pass with no issue and pulls ahead. Wilma
regains control of the baton, and strikes hard with her taped
ankle. She winces.
Jutta is ahead, but Wilma’s real race is against herself and
the too familiar pain in her leg.
                    ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
          Heine and Rudolph neck and neck...
          This may come down to a photo
          finish.
Suddenly, just like when she was a child... Wilma dig deeps
and lets loose a reserve burst of speed! She decidedly PULLS
AHEAD of Jutta!
                    ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
          Oh my word!
WILMA LEANS INTO THE TAPE! VICTORY! The Crowd goes wild.
                    ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
          Rudolph with a final burst of speed
          take it! The Tigerbelles have won
          gold and set yet another world
          record!

EXT. STADIO OLIMPICO - TRACK - SAME TIME
The Tigerbelles, tears of joy streaming down their faces,

PHOTO MONTAGE OF REAL LIFE TIGERBELLES OVER POST SCRIPT:
Billie White went on to become a storied track and field
athlete, becoming the first athlete from the U.S. to
participate in 5 Olympic games. After her Olympic retirement,
she founded an organization for helping inner-city children
build self-esteem. She died at age 67 in 2007.
Barbara Jones had a successful track and field career that
spanned 8 years, earning 335 medals and 56 trophies. She
married and had two children with Wendell, and went on to
become a Physical Education teacher.
Eleanor Williams retired from running after the 1960
Olympics, but stayed on as a chaperone as the U.S. Team
toured Europe through 1963. She earned a master’s degree in
Physical Education, and was inducted into the Savannah, GA
Hall of Fame in 1968, and the TSU Hall of Fame in 1983.
Wilma Rudolph was the first American woman to win three gold
medals in track and field at a single Olympics. This record
has still not been surpassed.
Wilma retired from Track and Field in 1962, became an
elementary school teacher, and eventually married and had
three more children with Robert. In 2004, her legacy was
honored with a U.S. Postage Stamp. She died of brain cancer
at the age of 54 in 1994.
Ed Temple coached at Tennessee State University for 41 years.
He was the head coach of the US Olympic Women’s Track team in
1960 and 1964, and was the assistant coach in 1980. In his
time as a coach, his Tigerbelles earned 34 National titles,
and 23 Olympic medals -- 13 of them Gold. However, he was
always more impressed with his record of 39 of his 40
Olympians earning one or more college degrees. He died in
2016.
