 Grass. Waves of it. We’re low. Stalking, as if a predator. *  A distant GROWL. We push forward, the grass sways, the growl *  intensifies. Something’s out there. *  As the sound crescendoes--we emerge from the grass to reveal: *  The grill of a 4X4 pulls into frame. The engine cuts. A *  boot squelches earth. *  Two MEN step from the TRUCK. One grabs a rifle. Behind *  them, the moonlit SAVANNAH. *  The men move cautiously through tangled Marula trees. Only *  the sound of their footsteps. Then the CRACK of a branch. *  Both men lower to a knee. Listen. *  Labored breathing, beyond the tree-line. The leader motions. *  LEADER *  Sala, sala. *  His PARTNER nods. They stay low, sweating now. Reveal: *  In a CLEARING. A FEMALE LION. Agitated. She is eight feet *  from hip to jaw. 300 pounds. Her leg caught in a SNARE *  TRAP. Even still: *  There’s a phenomenal presence about her. Acknowledged in *  both men’s eyes. The leader raises his rifle. Pulls the *  hammer. CLICK. *  Her attention whips towards us. The leader fires. THWAP. A *  TRANQ DART. The lioness jolts, staggers, falls. *  The leader breathes relief. Hands his partner the rifle. *  They enter the clearing as: *  We CUT BACK to another POV. Something is watching them. *  ANGLE ON: The leader, crouched beside the animal. He *  releases the hinge on the trap, pulls the dart, checks the *  animal’s teeth, underbelly--comments-- *  But we focus on his Partner, kneeling, listening-- *  A RUSTLE is the grass. Partner pivots, eyes the darkness. *  Je, umesikia jambo hilo? *  Leader shakes his head. No, I didn’t hear anything. Partner *  stands anyway--raises the rifle. Steps towards the shadows. *  Eyes searching. Then that RUSTLE again. *  He stops--listens--until: *  WHAM. He’s hit from the side. Partner almost screams. *  Then realizes. Leader has him by the arm. Grins. *  Pata Kamba. *  Using ropes affixed to the lioness’s legs, the two men heave *  the animal into the bed of the truck-- *  While Leader secures the ropes, his Partner jumps down-- *  Taps a cigarette from his pack. Glad to be done. He steps *  away. Puts the cigarette to his lips. Raises the lighter. *  VPPP. CLICK. *  But it never touches the cigarette. A CRACK to his right. *  ANGLE ON: The Leader as it happens. A MASSIVE SHAPE rips *  through frame. Leader turns. But his partner is gone. *  Silence. He jumps down from the truck. Calls once more. *  Nothing. Grabs a flashlight. Scans the terrain. *  Moves away from the vehicle. *  Hii sio ya kuchekesha? *  Suddenly he kicks something. Looks. The man’s expression. *  Oh. My. God. Then we see what he does: *  A BLOOD SOAKED SHOE. Abduya’s foot is still in it. And the *  grass beyond... *  Like someone sprayed the Savannah red. *  But it only gets worse. A deep, guttural, snarl from behind. *  Leader is almost too terrified to look. He slowly turns. *  But we only see the horror in the man’s eyes... *  He BOLTS. Back towards the thicket. *  The Marula trees lit in bursts of swinging light. Branches *  whip his body. His face. And then: *  SNAP. DRAW. The man is ripped off his feet, as if grabbed *  by something... The flashlight tumbles. *  But it wasn’t something--his own fucking SNARE-- *  He pries at his leg. Blood oozes. The monster is coming. *  We can hear it, feel it. *  Slowing as its prey has been immobilized. *  The man struggles in ungodly terror. But it’s no use. So he *  crawls. Desperate. Until: *  The chain draws tight. And now he knows. Apoplectic with *  fear. He turns. *  A shape enters frame. Something massive. The last thing we *  see are the MAN’S EYES before the entire screen is obscured *  by the monster.... *  Though we can still hear him SCREAM. *  We hold. Then from the darkness one word emerges: *  FROM TITLES: *  Gliding above the plains of Central Africa. Dark storm *  clouds curl against the bluest sky. *  A BUSH PLANE drops into frame. *  CLOSE ON: A silver WEDDING RING spun between fingers. Pan *  up to NATE SAMUELS, early 40’s, reflected in the dusty *  The PILOT is local--accented British-Afrikanese. A thermos *  with an extra tin cup. Nate considers-- *  He sips. Grimaces. Strong. *  Pilot looks towards two girls. Dead asleep in their seats. *  The one with the headphones is JESS, 13. Awkwardly trapped *  between the girl she was and the woman she’ll become. *  The other is MEREDITH (MARE), 17. Honor student, UCLA bound. *  She snores softly. *  They seem very excited. *  Nate smiles again, reflexively slips the ring back on his *  finger. Then: *  In the near distance--ELEPHANTS emerge from a tree grove--- *  He grins, dips the wings--banks down so the elephants begin *  to run--Nate marvels-- *  As they glide alongside, the animals close enough to touch. *  A strip of graded sand. Chickens cluck on the tarmac. Pan *  up as the bush plane descends, scattering the birds. *  Nate helps the pilot unload luggage from the rear of the *  aircraft. Jess, still groggy, sits on a silver roller bag. *  see are chickens. *  They’re back, clucking at her feet. *  Mare, knelt over her CAMERA BAG, half smiles, half rolls her *  eyes. Busy fitting a lens onto a beat up Nikon-- *  Nate grins, pulls the last bag from the back, glances at *  Mare. *  She stands. Lens fitted. Pushes her dark curls back. *  But her tone betrays the comment. A dream come true for her. *  Evident as she turns away. Takes in the air, the sky, the *  cracked-stucco building that serves as: *  Large fans pump air through the building. Makeshift vendors *  sell everything from sodas to “authentic” tribal masks. *  Nate and Jess sit on a bench. Nate’s head back. Eyes *  closed. *  A joke. Mostly. He smirks. Tousles the hair on her head. *  She ducks away, as he looks towards: *  Mare, who peruses the vendor stalls. Plastic animals, wood *  A car horn draws her attention. Nate and Jess too. *  A white RANGE ROVER, scraped and bush-worn, approaches in a *  swirl of dust. Nate emerges, pack slung, followed by Jess. *  Squinting in the sun drenched plume. *  The man who steps out is MARTIN BATTLES. White. South *  African born. A bushman through and through. Nates grins-- *  the men are long time friends. *  They hug. *  Indicating with his hand--a toddler at most. She smiles, *  shy, there’s the child, but only for a moment. Martin’s eyes *  travel past her-- *  To Mare. Pack, camera. Just walking up. *  The girls have that shy we know you but we don’t vibe. *  As he helps with their stuff we hear: *  Martin drives--Nate shotgun--Mare and Jess in back. The *  latter watches the grass and the marula whip past. *  Martin glances at Nate, grins. *  A two story colonial, built nearly a century ago. Thick  foliage surrounds the property like walls. An open air  garage filled with mechanics tools, a half built motorcycle.  The Rover pulls in and parks. On Nate as he steps out.  Takes the house in.  With a grin--  Nate and the girls follow Martin inside. A unique mix of old  world and bachelor pad.  That’s the kitchen, parlor, and in  Once formal, now forgotten.  Dusty boxes. Framed photos and art stacked against walls.  Mare looks back, but it’s Jess who responds:  She’s not. Martin throws Nate a look, grins.  sometimes the people--  Mare picks up a tribal mask--  Before he can answer--  A framed photograph. Jess wipes the dust.  She hands it to Mare. Black and white. A woman in a cotton  dress, standing on a deck. This is Hannah Samuels.  Nate, early 20’s, leans against a wood railing, grinning at  Hannah.  Jess beams at her Dad. He returns the smile. It’s Mare who  catches the heartbreak behind it.  Indicates the small bulge in Hannah’s tummy. The emotion  from both girls is palpable.  Mare looks at her Dad, then Martin.  They follow him--  He unlocks a french door, top then bottom--  He pushes open the doors to reveal:  Two chairs on the peeling porch. That same hand carved  railing under vaulted eaves. And beyond:  The ZAMBEZI RIVER winding through the Savannah--an impossible  sky stretches into the horizon.  It’s an unbelievable sight. Reflected in both girl’s eyes.  We hold on this tableau. This family. Just for a few  seconds more.  The sun falls over the plains. Impossible hues of pink. The  symphony of wildlife.  Dark now. Light glows from within. We hear laughter.  Would be formal with a familial touch. It’s not. A half *  finished bottle of wine. Martin, Jess, Nate, and Mare, their *  plates nearly empty. Radio plays local rock and roll. *  Martin is looking through photos on Mare’s camera. *  Mare glances at her Dad. Martin too. *  old man’s footsteps. UCLA. Long *  Mare glances at Jess. The little one looks at her plate. *  Martin grins. Looks at Nate. *  Where Nate stares out over the landscape. The buzz of *  fireflies and distant bats black against the purple sky. *  The screen door squeaks. Martin emerges, two whiskeys, hands *  one to Nate, then nods towards the girls: *  Nate looks back. Mare and Jess wash dishes in the kitchen. *  Martin grins and raises his glass. *  They toast. *  Nate nods. The moments holds, then: *  An envelope from his pocket-- *  Nate looks at the envelope, meaningful. *  Nate looks over. *  Martin nods. The rumble of thunder. *  their chests and throw themselves *  This effects Nate deeply. He looks at Martin. *  We hold on Nate. And it begins to pour. *  Rain in sheets on the window. Pan down to Mare, reading in *  the lamp light. A soft knock on the door. She looks up.  Jess. Skinny in her dad’s old T-shirt. From teenager to  child.  Mare smiles, nods. Jess climbs in next to her big sister. *  They settle. *  Then looks up at her big sister.  We hold on Mare, her little sister snuggled into her chest.  Find Nate, unpacking his suitcase. Underneath the clothes is  a small card board box.  He removes it. Sets it on the dresser across from him. Then  sits on the bed.  Stares at the box. And the envelope sitting next to it.  The sun rises pink. Giraffe necks like palm trees against *  the horizon. Last night’s rain already evaporating in the *  heat. *  Nate loads his day pack into the rear of the rover. Comes *  around to find Martin, leaning against the open driver side *  door. CB handset on a spiral cord from the rover-- *  Martin hooks the CB. *  Jess and Mare approach. The former looks worse for wear-- *  Both in tank tops and jeans, Mare’s camera bag over her *  shoulder. A long angle lens in her hand. To Nate: *  Martin. The rhythm of family. *  They do. Martin grins at Nate. *  A drive like nowhere else in the world. The rover on a *  single dirt road--herds of WILDEBEEST and ZEBRA run along *  side. *  A RESERVE EMPLOYE, local, early 20’s handsome, this is BANJI. *  He turns as the Rover pulls up. *  Nate, Martin, and the girls pile out. Martin greets Banji in *  the native tongue. Introduces: *  Opens the back of the rover. Pulls out a BLACK CASE. *  Thick accent. His eyes fall on Mare. She notices, so does *  Nate. *  Come see for yourselves. *  Martin steps past Banji’s truck. Nate and the girls follow. *  Reverse to reveal. A PRIDE of lions at the edge of: *  No more then fifty yards distant. Eight females. Two large *  males, and several cubs at play... A series of large rocks *  embedded into the grass, dotted with Marula trees. *  He kneels down as Mare snaps off photos. *  Two very large male lions. Tavo looks up, catches them in *  the distance. Roars. Jess startles. Nate puts a hand on *  her shoulder. *  Protect them from what?  Martin glances at Nate, grins.  Martin says something to Banji. Hand him the case. Then *  takes off his jacket and radio. Takes one step-- *  Martin winks. Then walks slowly towards the pride. *  Immediately the lions take note. All of them. Their heads *  turned towards Martin. We stay with: *  NATE and the girls. Watching. The lone figure of Martin, *  hands out stretched as if facing a loaded gun. *  Mare notices that Banji has opened the black case and is *  assembling what looks like a rifle. *  He stands, looks through the scope. *  That’s when, two males drop off a rock. Now positioning *  themselves between Martin and the females. *  Jess looks back at her dad. *  INTERCUT WITH MARTIN *  Who’s no more then 25 yards away. The two MALES have taken *  aggressive posture, both stare him down as: *  What’s he doing--  Back with Martin as he stops, kneels. Sepo roars. The sound *  like a cannon blast. Martin holds up a single hand. *  His voice calm, soothing. Sepo, the lion who roared, takes *  another step forward. Martin’s hand still up. He and the *  lion lock eyes. Martin smiles-- *  That’s when the lion bounds forward. Martin holds his *  position. The lion closes fast-- *  Rears on his hind legs and Martin steps into it. *  Catching Sepo as if in a hug. Which it is. Because *  immediately the lion nuzzles his neck. *  Mare, Jess, and Nate watch. It’s an amazing sight, this man *  and a lion. *  Martin scratches the animal’s mane. As Tavo comes forward *  too. Banji lowers the rifle. Grins. *  Martin kneels to greet them both. The familiarity, the love, *  The two lions rub their bodies against his. Like house cats *  when you’ve just come home from a long day. *  Mare snaps another photo. *  Back with Martin, his eyes look past the lions. Scanning the *  lionesses, the cubs. And then he spots something. *  LUWI, the matriarch, the only lioness who has yet to stand. *  She remains in the shade of a Marula tree, licking a wound *  around her fore limb. Martin takes this in. Then turns his *  attention back to Sepo and Tavo-- *  Rubbing their ears, his eyes back on the lioness as we go: *  Martin returns to where the family waits. *  Nate throws her a look “hey.” *  Who just put the case back in Martin’s rover. They converse *  in the Native tongue, Martin’s expression is grave, then he *  explains to Nate and the girls: *  Banji says something. Martin responds. Banji nods. But:  Heads back towards his truck. A beat. *  Martin smiles, unconcerned. Looks at girls--  Jess nods. Mare steps forward. Snaps a photo of the *  matriarch. We hear: *  Heading further into the Savannah.  Nate looks over at him. *  Martin grins. You might be right.  The Rover flies past. But we stay. Panning across the bush *  to reveal a TRUCK. *  The same one from the opening. *  Barely visible. Parked right where the two poachers left it. *  Then we see the blood. Painted across the entire side of the *  truck with the vultures still bobbing for leftovers. *  The air is thick, the heat oppressive. Nate hands each girl  a camel pack.  The trunks slams. Martin comes around. Both girls notice  for the first time. He carries a RIFLE. That’s  disconcerting.  Nate shoulders his pack. Takes a WALKIE from Martin, who  clips his on his belt.  Martin glances at Nate. Smirks.  WE GO WIDE AND ABOVE as they head off.  What’s left of the mud has turned to dust. A hot wind blows  through sparse trees. Our family in single file. Martin and  Jess chatting--  Shows Nate a PHOTO on her camera of the lioness. Just  separate from Martin and Jess.  I like the way the light hits the  back of her neck--  He nods, then notices that Martin and Jess have stopped.  They’re looking at something. He approaches.  As he comes alongside, we see:  A GOAT. Standing in the middle of the trail. White.  Splattered with mud. A ROPE around its neck.  Mare snaps a picture.  It bleats mournfully. Martin kneels next to it--reaches out--  it flinches--he lays his hand to sooth.  Martin pulls the rope. The edge is frayed. Torn off. He  looks up.  A series of thatched roofed huts. Eleven in total. The  group approaches. The goat in toe.  The first thing they notice is the silence. But for the  wind. And a weird, rhythmic: WOOO KUNK. WOOO KUNK.  The village is seemingly empty.  Snaps off a photo. Martin looks back at Nate. Not sure to  what to make of it. Steps forward.  No answer. Except: WOOO KUNK. WOOO KUNK. Martin crosses to  a HUT, looks inside, as:  Nate approaches a small fire pit, leans down. The goat  BLEATS. WOO KUNK. WOO KUNK.  Who turns from the hut. Clearly no one inside.  Coals are still hot.  Suddenly the WOO KUNK stops. Martin turns. Mare stands over  the WELL at the center of the village. She hold the BUCKET  on the end of a rope.  But they hear something else now. BUZZING. Martin walks  past Mare. A small hill at the opposite side of the village.  Nate looks at Martin. Both are unsettled now.  Martin ascends the hill. Nate watches, then looks at his  girls. Mare scolds Jess for letting go of the Goat, the  latter defends herself.  When Nate looks back. Martin is gone. We hold. The  oppressive stillness. The heat.  Nate wipes sweat with his sleeve. Looks up the hill. What  the fuck? The unease getting to him.  They follow their father to the top of the hill. Where Nate  stops. Looks down to reveal:  He doesn’t answer. Kneeling at the edge of the grass. The  buzzing incessant. Nate descends.  That’s when stench hits. He recoils, a hand to his face--  sees what Martin does. Thankfully. We don’t. Only the  FLIES. Martin looks back. No fear. Just anger.  Nate’s seen some gnarly shit, but this--  what’s left of him.  ANGLE ON JESS:  What are they looking at?  A lie. The village. The behavior. She knows exactly what  they’re looking at. She steps forward. Angle on Jess. A  noise to her right. She turns. A flash of white. BACK TO:  Then a SQUAWK from the sky. Martin and Nate look. Vultures  circle above.  Nate turns. Mare is halfway down the hill--looking back--  suddenly frantic. It takes only a second to realize.  Jess is gone.  Jess moves through the grass. The huts in the background.  The noise she heard--a snuffling--louder as she draws closer.  Then movement, obscured by blades in the wind.  Another step and the movement stops. Something looks at her--  we can’t tell what. Jess freezes. A low growl. Then a yip--  whatever it was takes off.  Behind her, voices yelling her name. But she’s compelled.  Young, curious, stupid. She pushes forward. Hands in the  grass. An object in front of her. Feels something--  Sticky. Red. Even she knows. Blood. A spray of it. The  buzz of flies. Like a siren song. She parts the grass.  We don’t see what she does, not yet. But her eyes tell the  story. Her face drains of color. Pure fucking horror. She  opens her mouth to scream--  But it never comes. She’s ripped out of frame.  Reveal Nate, shielding his daughter’s eyes. Looks back.  Sees what Jess did.  The severed head of a man. His mouth locked in terror.  The rover zooms by.  What the hell happened back there?  The mood is tense. The hum of the engine and the jolt of  suspension over the rough road. Nate looks back at his  daughters--Mare has her arm around Jess, the latter’s dirty  face streaked with tears.  Martin shakes his head. He doesn’t know. Then:  Small, tears in her eyes.  Looks at Martin. The man’s eyes dead set in front. Then:  Before he can finish--  Both men looks to reveal:  A SHADOWY SILHOUETTE distorted in the waves of a heat--we’re  not sure at first... then realize--  A figure stumbles down the middle of the road. As they draw  closer, it appears to be a man--his clothes half shredded--  Martin does. The man suddenly stops--turns--the whites of  his eyes--he reaches out.  And crumples. A stunned beat. Then:  But he’s already out. We stay in the car as Martin circles,  pops the trunk and grabs his rifle.  He moves to the man. Scanning the terrain. Stops. Kneels.  Is he okay?  Nate watches. Then the doctor in him.  Nate gets out too.  He approaches Martin and the man--slows as he realizes the  latter is more blood then skin. Martin looks at Nate.  Nate keels. Feels for a pulse.  Martin nods. A unbelievable anger rising inside of him.  They ease the man to his back. The severity of the wounds *  reflected in Nate’s expression. Jesus. *  The man’s eyes shift. Swim. Can’t focus. The fact that  he’s even alive is a fucking miracle.  But Martin clocks their surroundings. The high grass just  beyond the road.  Then the man speaks....  Martin’s eyes snap back. Something haunting in this.  He looks back at Martin. Jaw clenching.  Martin steps away. Something’s out there. He can feel it.  Nate follows his eyes. He can feel it too:  That’s when the man grabs Nate’s collar. Pulls him down. In  broken fucking english.  Then a rush through the grass. No more then 40 yards away.  Martin spins. The rifle up. Hold. Silence.  Nate looks at Martin. His eyes gone feral. Oh no.  A beat. Martin scans the grass and trees. Decides.  He moves towards the sound. Rifle poised.  Nate looks back at the Rover.... His daughters faces pressed  against the glass. Then back to Mutende--  Mutende groans. When Nate looks up. Martin is gone.  The rover out of sight. Martin creeps quietly through the  grass towards a collision of high bush and sparse trees. The  silence is staggering.  Rifle up. Wary of any movement that isn’t his own. Squeezes  sweat from him eyes. Looks left, then right. That’s when he  hears the strangest sound---  Almost like HOLLOW WIND CHIMES.  The rear door opens, Nate rifles through supplies for the  first aid kit. His daughters watch from the back seat--  Nate finds what’s he looking for.  He looks up. Swallows the panic.  She nods, okay. He shuts the trunk. As we go:  With Martin. The bush and trees are head height. Visibility  fucking nil. Yet he pushes forward.  The sound is louder now.  Rifle on a swivel. He finally emerges:  The size of an olympic swimming pool. A mud beach on the far  side. But here, the bush grows almost to the edges. A few  CROCODILE slip into the water.  But that’s not what gets his attention. He looks up. The  source of the sound.  ANIMAL BONES hang from the trees. Hundreds of them.  And below. An ALTAR of colored stones and feathers and a  painted buffalo skull.  He kneels. What the fuck?  That’s when he sees it. Nearby. Fresh prints. A CAT TRACK.  And they’re fucking huge. He moves.  Nate, dripping sweat, goes to work on Mutende. Blood spreads  across the sand. The flies already buzzing.  Nate applies gauze to the neck. But that’s not the worst of  it. The man’s wounds are everywhere. He’s delirious.  Fading fast.  He rips open the man’s shirt. Reacts. Jesus. That’s when  Mutende gives a final heave. And goes still.  Mare, now in the front seat, has the CB working, but it’s  only static. She twists channels. Into the handset.  Static. Jess, in the back, knees hugged to her chest. Looks  towards her father who begins CPR.  The question unanswered. Back to Martin. Along the water’s  edge. The sun dappling through. Moisture rises.  He stops. Across the water is old elevated structure,  painted the color of the trees. A HUNTERS BLIND. Then:  SNAP. RUSTLE. Martin pivots. There it is again. Just  beyond the trees.  GOTCHA.  CLOSE ON: Nate’s hands. Blood slick. Rhythmically pushing  Mutende’s chest. One. Two. Three. Breath.  Jess watches. One. Two. Three. Breath.  One. Two. Three. But it doesn’t matter. He stops. Shirt  soaked crimson. The man is dead.  He looks back once more--  Where Martin emerges from the trees. On the opposite side of  the watering hole. The sun rages. The grass in waves.  THAT SOUND AGAIN. Just ahead. MOVEMENT. He steels himself.  Cautiously forward.  Something is there. He sweats fucking bullets. Draws  closer.  Reaches with the barrel and..... WOOOOOOOSH. He screams.  Falls back--  Nate hears the scream, turns. The girls too. It echoes.  Then a burst of quail scatter into the sky.  Nate moves towards the trees. Further from the rover.  Everything’s gone really fucking quiet. A beat.  Who rises to his elbows. Breath in gasps. The birds flock  towards the horizon. Somewhere in the distance:  Pulls himself together.  He looks. Finds. The rifle. He dropped it. Several feet  away. He breathes.  Reaches. Stops. That’s when it happens.  A HORRIBLE SOUND. Behind him. A low guttural snarl.  He doesn’t even fucking turn.  Looks back at the gun. A beat.  And lunges--  On Nate. Eyes scanning the horizon. BOOM. Echoing in the  stillness. BOOM.  Two gunshots. Hold. Then. A GUT WRENCHING SCREAM.  The worst sound he’s ever heard. Terror. Pain.  The girls hear it too.  Who looks from the radio to--  Nate scans the tangled growth.  We hold. Then he sees it. Movement.  Bursting from the trees. 100 yards in the distance.  ANGLE ON MARTIN  Fast limping in abject terror. His right leg shredded.  Breath in strangled bursts. No longer holding the gun.  Looks back, eyes manic as:  Steps forward. Can see Martin’s bleeding. The men’s eyes  meet. Martin YELLS. Nate can’t make out the words.  Desperate. His screams choked by rasping breath.  Steps forward again. Equidistant between the rover and  Martin. Then he hears it:  A moment to realize. That’s when it happens.  Martin’s feet are torn out from under him. He vanishes in *  the grass. An ungodly SCREAM. A brief glimpse of matted *  fur. A guttural snarl we’ll never forget. *  The girls see it too. Mare pulls Jess away from the window. *  Back to Nate. Suddenly paralyzed with indecision. The *  desire to help Martin. The safety of the rover.  Fight or flight mother fucker.  But the screaming stops. Silence.  Mare and Jess both watch in horror. Their dad. The grass  beyond. Jess, tears in her eyes, on the fucking verge--  But Mare doesn’t answer... because she sees something that  takes her breath away.  She pounds on the window.  Nate turns. Her muffled scream. Then she rolls the window  down. Fast. The terror in her eyes.  NATE looks back. Now sees what she did. Something in the  tall grass. Moving. Like a torpedo in the ocean.  And it’s headed right towards him. He takes off as fast as  he fucking can. The moment he does.  So does the animal. Though we only see flashes.  Sprinting through the grass.  Mare can see movement closing on Nate. As he runs like a bat  But the movement is almost on him. Nate draws close.  Mare opens the ROVER door for him as he dives:  Slams the door behind him just as:  WHAM. The Rover is rocked by a half ton of pure FORCE. The  side window spiderwebs--  Jess SCREAMS in terror.  WHAM. It’s rocked again. The door bends, plastic cracks.  Mare too, both girls screaming. Nate on top of Mare, the two  of them knocked to the floor.  He can see her curled into a ball.  STAY DOWN, JESS, STAY DOWN.  WHAM. The rover is literally lifted off its wheels before  slamming BACK. With a groan and a crash.  Then silence.  CLOSE ON: Mare and Nate. He holds his hand over her mouth.  Her dinner plate eyes. Looks at Jess. Hyperventilating.  Tears streaking her dirty cheeks--you’ve never seen terror  like this.  BOOM. The animal comes again, hard, fast. This time  shattering the window. His massive paw inside the ROVER.  All CLAWS and blood stained fur. The sound is incredible--  Like being in shark cage. Nate torques sideways, Mare pinned  beneath him. Drives his boot into the animal’s leg.  We only catch glimpses in the frenzy. The animal trying to  jam his way in--  Jess covers her ears, eyes squeezed, screams--  Nate kicks. The lion swipes. Claws dig into his boot.  The look on Nate’s face. Oh fuck. He’s suddenly yanked off  Mare and towards the window. He plants his other foot.  Catches himself.  He strains. Claws dig in. He yells. It’s trying to pull  him out of the fucking rover. Mare grabs his arm.  But she realizes. They aren’t gonna win this tug of war.  Clocks the keys in the ignition. She reaches. Fires the  engine. RUMMMMMMM.  She lunges for the gas pedal. Floors it with her palm. The  wheels spin, then catch.  The rover jolts forward. Moves. We stay inside. Can’t see  anything. Rocks, bushes, dust.  Hits 20, 25--  The animal suddenly rips free. Nate drops into the seat.  He sits up, tries to get control but it’s barreling towards a  dry river bed--  Too fucking fast. Barely time to brace as:  WHAM. The Rover PLOWS into an outcropping of rocks with  astonishing force. The back end lifts, threatens to FLIP--  Over the rocks and plummet into the RIVERBED.  But it slams down.  We hold on the rover.  The rippling heat. The front end crushed. Canted against  the rocks. Steaming. Crippled.  We go WIDE. The rover. Tiny against the endless Savannah.  Hold. Nothing but the wind.  CLOSE ON: Nate. Forehead on the steering wheel. Sweat  dripping with blood. He comes to. Gets his bearings. Sees  Mare crumpled against the floor below the dash.  Moves to her. She stirs. Opens her eyes. Looks at him.  No. But there are tears. Nate spins.  We don’t see her yet. Just the look on his face.  There she is, curled in the seat. Trembling. Eyes wide.  Breath in bursts.  She looks at him. Eyes frantic. Can’t get a breath. Nate  climbs in the:  BACK SEAT  Where he takes her hands.  Panicked. Sucking air.  Mare watches her Dad. As Jess calms. The whole experience  suddenly crashing home.  Jess nods. Throws her arms around him. Nate looks back at  Mare.  He doesn’t know how to answer. That’s when Mare looks  towards the trees... the grass.  Is he dead? Martin, you saw him,  right? Did it kill him?  Back in front. NATE turns the ignition. The engine coughs,  WAAAA WAAAA WAAAA. Again. WAAAAA.  Once more, but:  The rover is dead.  Nate sits back. Mare’s eyes on him. The glare of the sun  through the dusty windshield.  But Nate’s just trying to catch up with his own raging fear.  see us--  He doesn’t, clearly. Not sure what to say, how to control  the situation... and then:  And for the first time it occurs to him. The shattered  driver’s side window. Their exposure. He can’t help but  scan the grass.  We hold on this. The complete stillness of the Savannah.  Then:  A burst of static. Something that sounds like a voice.  Not from the CB, but--a radio--knocked under the seat--  Nate finds it. Turns the dial--  Adjusting the frequency.  A little farther, until:  A beat. The response forever to come.  With Martin. He’s sitting against a tree. His complexion  near death grey. Splattered with blood. Soaked in sweat.  Incomprehensible pain. His eyes fixed in front of him.  Every word a struggle. Radio laced with static.  Are the girls (static) are they--  Martin either. Both men at a loss. On Nate--  But he can’t finish the thought, he tries to move but the  pain is too much--he groans through it--  Nate looks back at Mare. A beat. Calms himself. Does the  only thing he knows how to do.  your leg, right?  Where’s the wound--  Martin pulls back the torn pant leg. Cries out.  Soaking the sand beneath his shredded leg.  Martin struggles to pull off his belt. Loops. Draws it  tight. Cries out. We hear this through the radio.  Nate lowers the radio--looks back at his daughters. A  decision to make.  On Martin now. He shakes his head. Still staring ahead,  we’re not sure at what. Back to:  Static. Then clear as hell.  That’s when we reverse to Martin’s POV. We don’t see it at  first because of the grass. And then we do. Two golden eyes  fixed on Martin. Only 20 feet away.  He’s staring right at me.  Even though we can’t see it, Martin can.  Nate looks back at the girls. Then into the radio:  Martin grinds, finally:  Nate look out over the endless landscape. There is nothing--  least of all help. Into the walkie:  We hold on Martin. Staring head, delirium taking hold. *  That’s when the animal turns away. Disappearing into the  grass.  Who lowers the radio. Looks back at his daughters. Big *  eyes. Then: *  Nate--on his knees, T-shirt ringed with sweat--rifles through  the turned boxes and scattered items from the crash. Finds:  FLARES, ROPE, EMERGENCY BLANKET. AID KIT, SURVIVAL KNIFE. *  FLASHLIGHT.  He stops. Then notices. A pad-locked METAL BOX bolted into *  the side of the rover.  But he needs a key. Doesn’t have it. *  A beat. Then:  He rips back the carpet. The SPARE tire. The portable jack.  He works fast. Jams the jack inside the lock. Steadies with  his foot.  And cranks. It takes all his strength. Finally:  POP. The lock breaks. He opens the BOX. Inside is the *  BLACK CASE. He opens the case. *  In three pieces. STOCK. CHAMBER. BARREL. Also in the BOX.  A zippered pouch. Inside are THREE DARTS. Filled with  liquid.  Nate looks back Mare and Jess. Relief. No matter how  fleeting.  She does. Climbs in back. A beat later. Jess too. Doesn’t  want to be alone. Into the walkie:  Struggling to stay conscious.  Martin breathes. He’s fading fast.  Nate hands Mare the radio.  He nods. Go ahead.  it’s a lock-in mechanism.  It does...  Nate looks out. It’s flat as far as the eye can see. Then:  She looks up. The rover has a retractable sun roof.  Martin lowers the radio, it’s almost too much just to hold  Nate cranks the SUN ROOF BACK. Both girls sweating now too.  She hands him the rifle. The dart pouch. He sets them on  the roof. Back to his daughters.  They nod. He swallows, breathes, emerges.  Into the blaring sun. He shimmies all the way out. Reaches  back for the radio.  Now laying on his stomach--sniper style. Exposed. The case  with the remaining two tranqs next to him.  Nate scans with SCOPE. We see the tree. The grass between.  He lowers the radio. Back into the scope. A magnified view  as he pans slowly across the Savannah.  Nothing but the wind and sound of CICADAS.  Sweat drips into Nate’s eyelashes. He blinks it away. The  radio blares. It’s shockingly loud.  He wipes the sweat with his collar.  Jess and Mare both look out. Jess catches Mare’s eye. The  fear--  Nate. Still scanning. That’s when he hears it. The cicadas  have stopped. Even the wind. It’s eerie.  A new kind of silence. Then:  Hard to tell what. Obscured by the grass. Looks like it’s  headed towards the tree, towards Martin--  He ignores her. Finger on the trigger.  Then it emerges. Or rather... they. THREE ANTELOPE.  Munching grass. Not a care in the world. Nate relaxes.  He lowers the scope.  gone. Maybe it lost interest...  But he trails off. Sees something--  He looks through the scope. The antelope are no longer  eating.  Three heads pointed in the same direction. Their noses  stretched into the wind. It’s fucking creepy.  He follows their eye line. Panning to his right....  Slowly, slowly, slowly.  THE POV of the scope. He leans to the side. Scope to his  right. Nothing but grass and then...  He stops. Hold.  Pans back. Even slower. Slower. Slower. He stops.  Something out of focus.  He reaches for the scope. Turns it. One notch. Two.  CLICK. The image in focus.  It takes a second to realize. The lion, barely visible in  the grass. Stalking forward.  Magnified.  The rest happens fast. The lion charges. Nate fires.  Misses.  Lowers the scope just in time to see:  A SHAPE EXPLODE from grass like a heat seeking missile. *  Nate rolls. Off the rover. Slams into the dirt. He grunts.  Stunned.  A BEAT.  He sees the case with the tranq darts in the dirt. About to  lunge for them when:  DAD. HE’S COMING.  A RUSH of MOVEMENT. All Nate can see are it’s legs. He *  rolls under the chassis as a paw swipe tears a chunk out of  the tire.  But the lion isn’t done.  He jams his head beneath the rover like some possessed  monster. Nothing but jaws and blood and spit. *  Nate scrambles back, pinned to the ditch, nowhere to go.  Realizing he’s out of reach, the animal swipes for him.  Like a kitten swiping for yarn under a door. Except this is  a 1000 pounds of snarling lion under a one ton rover.  Now wedging itself deeper under the rover and closer to Nate.  Still out of reach until... The lion’s shoulders, how under  the car, begin to LIFT IT--  Mare and Jess are tossed to the side as the vehicle tips.  Jess screams.  Nate, desperately looking for a way out.  Then he sees it. His tranq rifle. By his feet. Using his  foot, he strains for it.  Closer. Closer. Hooks it, pulls it up--  Nate swings the butt of the rifle. WHAM. Into the animal’s  nose. WHAM. WHAM. We hear a crack. The lion reels.  THE ROVER SLAMS BACK DOWN  The girls tossed. In the CHAOS.  Nate sees the DART CASE. He scrambles. Half under, half out  from the rover. Grabs the case. Rolls back as the animal  comes at him again--  The lion possessed. Nate fumbles with the case.  Opens it.  Only one dart inside. And it’s shattered. SHIT.  The animal growing more frenzied. Wedging itself again.  Mare braces herself. Looks for something, anything, she can  use to fight if off as BELOW:  SWIPE. A claw connects with NATE’S shoulder. He screams.  He kicks. Drives himself as far back as he can. Dust and  spit and blood everywhere.  Recoils from the snapping jaws. Nowhere left to go. The  animal is inches from tearing him apart. The rover heaves.  INSIDE. Mare braces. Then out of the corner of her eye.  She sees. Rolling across the floor.  THE THIRD DART. BACK TO:  NATE. The animal’s head turned, going for his throat. *  Those gaping jaws. Nate is fucked. On the verge of being  ripped apart. Nothing left to do:  But SCREAM.  And just as the lion surges, the jaws about to clamp down.  Nate closes his eyes. And....  The lion suddenly pulls back. The rover slam down.  And silence.  Hold on Nate. The dust. His face covered in it. What the  fuck happened? *  He catches his breath.  Then two feet outside the car. Mare leans down.  He looks at her.  He nods. Crawls out. To a knee. Still pulsing with  adrenaline. Looks at his daughter.  He pulls her to him. Hugs her with everything he’s got.  Then sees Jess in the open passenger door. Takes her hand.  Gathers. Finally:  A pair of scissors on a blood drenched pant leg.  In the TRUNK. Martin is propped in Mare’s lap. Nate kneels  over the wounded leg. All of them are sweating. The safety  of the Rover is a fucking sauna. Nate manages a smile.  As he cuts away the fabric--  Our first view of the damage. Shredded skin. Bone. Muscle.  It’s Jess who answers.  That’s a lot of blood.  Come here. Reaching for the aid kit. Forceps. He digs  around. Martin yells out.  Pinches the artery. To Mare:  In unfathomable pain.  Nate nods, eases a bit into his mouth. Martin drinks. Lays  back. Staring straight up.  Nate goes to work. Martin grits back the pain. It doesn’t  take long. He bites the sutures with his teeth.  Mare does. No blood pumps. Nate wipes the sweat.  But Martin looks at Nate, the girls.  And finally, mercifully, he passes out. Mare looks at Nate.  Emotional. Tears glisten against the dust on her cheeks.  Nate. His hands covered in blood. Sweat soaked.  Finally Nate looks at her.  Nate looks at his girls. The blood stained trunk. Finally:  He needs a hospital, sweetheart--  What if we carry him--  we can do for him is get help.  A beat. They nod.  She nods. Looks towards the watering hole.  That’s when Nate sees something that he can’t fucking  believe. Out the window, behind her.  But when she follows his eyes, she see what he does. The  lion at the edge of the grass. 20 yards away. His face  mucked with dirt and spit and blood--his massive body heaving  with rapid breath. Staring right at them.  And as this statement lands. Nate’s eyes locked with the  lion. The monster turns away, as if he just wanted to let  them know he’s still there. Off Nate’s look we:  The sun hangs low in the sky. Grass blows. Waves of heat. *  MARE (O.S.) *  Pan up to Mare. Her hair sweat stuck to her forehead. *  Cycling through each channel on the CB. *  Static. But we knew it would be. Nate climbs into the front *  seat next to her. *  He takes off his watch. Puts it on the dash. It’s 6:03 pm. *  Nate turns back to console Jess. Her terrified eyes. *  Nate snaps her a look over his shoulder. *  She’s shakes her head. *  He knows she’s right, but tries maintain a semblance of calm. *  Mare looks out the window. A defeated sigh. *  The two girls. Asleep in the moonlight. Jess in the back. *  Mare in the passenger seat. New sounds in the night. *  Nate sits next to Martin. Vigilant. Eyes out over the *  Savannah. *  Martin stirs--his bandages blood soaked--lips cracked, a *  brutal shade of looming death. *  Nate squeezes water from a soaked cloth into Martin’s mouth. *  Martin shakes his head. *  them starve or are killed by other *  lions. *  Hold on Nate. *  Martin laughs. The night settles. Nate looks back at his *  girls. *  Nate looks at Martin. Nods. Then: *  Nate looks at him. *  We hold. Somewhere an animal calls. That’s when Nate’s eyes *  fix on something. The hardest thing he’s ever had to say: *  Martin follows his eyes to the bottle of water, a quarter *  full--then back to Nate. The implication clear. The emotion *  in both men’s eyes. *  A beat. Nate takes his hand. The former’s head falls back. *  His mortality crashing home. *  We hold on this tableau... *  SMASH TO: *  The sun’s beauty unmatched by the impending horror it brings. *  ON NATE. Asleep. A fly crawls across his lips. Hops up to *  his eye. The lid startles. *  He blinks awake. Disoriented for the moment. His lips now *  cracked. His skin ever so sunken, stained by sun and sand. *  He looks over at Martin. Unconscious once more. His breath *  short, but even. Nate rises, then to his horror-- *  Sees the bottle of water. It’s been knocked over. Spilled *  everywhere. *  He crawls over. It’s all fucking gone. A moment to realize. *  Then the strangest sound. *  Creeeeeeeaaaaak. He rises. He looks. The passenger door. *  Opening in the wind. But that isn’t the worst of it. *  The girls are gone. *  Looking wildly. Panicking. Until... Holy. Shit. He crawls *  to the opposite side of the car. Both Mare and Jess are *  standing in the middle of the grass. Mare behind Jess. Her *  arms around her. Staring towards the horizon. *  BACK IN THE CAR. *  Tries to roll down the window. It won’t budge. He can’t *  open the door either. He’s trapped. Then a crash to his *  right, their left. *  Seemingly oblivious. She looks at him. *  AND A SHAPE FLIES THROUGH FRAME, TAKING DOWN BOTH GIRLS AS: *  Nate rockets awake. Sweating bullets. Realizes it was a  dream. Gathers.  He checks his watch. 4:36 am.  The last few hours have taken their toll. Lips cracked.  Dark circles. He looks stricken. Then:  He looks up. His daughter turned in her seat.  That’s when he sees it. Just past Mare.  She follows his eyes to the CB. A light blinks. Nate climbs  across the back seat.  Nate spins up the volume. A burst of static. Soft. Then  what sounds like a voice--though unintelligible.  Nate adjusts the frequency, the static clears, the voice  coming through--  What’s he saying?  Then it crystalizes. Male. Young. Not in English.  He’s about to... when: there’s LAUGHTER. Something cavalier  in it. That’s when they see it, both of them. In the  distance.  A burst of light. It sharpens to reveal headlights--two  laser beams in the twilight.  As it eclipses a small rise, we realize it’s a PICK UP TRUCK.  Maybe a quarter mile away. Then strangely it stops.  A figure jump out of the bed. Stands in the headlights.  She does. He zooms in. We don’t see what he does.  He looks back at Jess. Something like desperation.  But he’s already climbing in the back.  She stirs as Mare takes the camera.  HER POV: The man in the headlights carries a RIFLE.  Another in the back. The truck is a beat up Nissan, rust  stains and scratches. A searchlight mounted on a makeshift  There’s something in the truck bed.  BLOOD STAINED ELEPHANT TUSKS. At least eight of them.  That’s when the search light turns on. It arcs across the  Savannah. And lands on the ROVER. She turns to:  But the man is Hypovolemic.  The pick up now descending the ridge and heading their way.  Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.  Nate looks back. The SURVIVAL KNIFE.  As the poacher’s truck growls to a stop. No more then fifty  feet back. It idles a beat. We pull back to reveal Nate.  In the driver’ seat. Hands clearly displayed on the steering  wheel. Mare and Jess terrified in back.  Nate looks as two men jump from the truck bed.  One is well built, thirties, a worn Dodgers Cap--the dude  with the Rifle. We’ll call him DODGER. The other is SPECS,  glasses, Jurassic Park T-shirt. Another Rifle.  They aim their weapons at Nate.  Nate doesn’t respond. Dodger steps forward threateningly.  A beat. He looks back at Mare and Jess.  Nate steps out.  Hands out-stretched. The two men evaluate him. Hold.  Then the truck door opens and a man approaches. Clearly the  leader. This is LIKEZO.  Mare and Jess watching.  Nate’s eyes snap from him, to the two other Armed men.  Likezo raises a flashlight, clicks it into Nate’s eyes.  Nate squints, holds up a hand to ward off the light. Likezo  moves the light into the Rover, illuminating Jess and Mare.  Who are they?  The man holds the flashlight on Mare and Jess... as if  evaluating.  We see the knife, tucked in the back of Nate’s jeans.  Then he steps into the light. Blocking Jess and Mare.  Likezo grins. He likes that.  Nate doesn’t say it, but... Yeah, no shit.  You say attacked. By what?  Likezo looks out at the Savannah. To his men:  They laugh.  A loaded beat. Dodger says something. Likezo responds. A  brief argument--it escalates--the implications are  terrifying.  Likezo looks back. Dodger says something else. Gestures  with the gun.  Argument over. Then turns back to Nate.  But Likezo holds up a hand. It feels like an eternity.  Nate nods, grateful.  That’s when he shines the light inside the rover,  illuminating Martin. Recognition. And it’s not good.  Everything suddenly changes.  He pulls his pistol, points it at Nate--  The rest happens fast. Dodger and Specs immediately move  towards the rover. Nate tries to cut them off, but Likezo  brutally pistol whips Nate to the ground.  He falls hard. His ears ringing. Stunned.  We stay on Nate. In the background, the men rip open the  Rover door, they’re yelling, but it seems so far away.  Nate rises to his hands and knees.  Mare is yanked from the rover, fights like hell. Yet, she’s  overpowered, thrown to the ground. Jess is next. Screaming  bloody murder.  But that’s not what draws Nate’s attention. He looks.  Beyond the lights. The edge of the shadows. Movement.  Nate yells, but we hear nothing. Then again, but this time:  THE SOUND RUSHES BACK IN.  TAO. TAO. TAO.  The force of his voice. The men stop. Likezo turns. A  beat. Then:  That’s when it happens. Like a fucking bullet. The lion  comes out of the dark. He grabs Dodger by the throat and  literally carries the man screaming into the bush.  Likezo barely has time to aim and fire. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.  BOOM. But the cat is gone.  And the screaming stops.  Likezo scans the dark. Another sound. He spins. It’s Nate.  Standing now. Both men hyped. A beat. We think he’s gonna  shoot our hero. But:  Nate nods. Helps Mare and Jess from the ground. While:  Likezo SHOUTS something to Specs. Who’s on the verge of  panic. Likezo leaves him, the flashlight held like a SWAT  officer, pistol up. As we go:  Nate opens the door.  Martin groans, his eyes flutter.  Trying to lift the man, who yells in pain--  Finds Dodger prone in the grass. Barely alive. His head and  throat a mess of blood. Behind him:  Help me move him. But Specs is shitting his fucking pants.  He looks back at the truck.  He grabs Dodger’s arm. Flashlight in his teeth. Tries to  pull him, while keeping the gun up.  Specs watches this. Again looks at the truck. Then shines  his flashlight on Likezo--  WOOSH. The lion comes out of the shadows. A paw swipe,  though we barely see it. Likezo is spun out of the light.  The flashlight falls.  Specs officially freaks, as we go:  Nate and Mare lift Martin, but. We hear the TRUCK DOOR OPEN.  Mare is the first to look--  Nate sees Specs climb in the truck--the engine guns.  He sprints after it. We go with him. Hear the truck’s gears  grind. It starts to move.  Accelerating. Nate sprints along side. Tries to open the  door. Pounds on the window.  Faster. Nate can barely keep up. Then he can’t. He  stumbles. Falls. Looks as the tail-lights recede--  Then back towards the Rover. Barely visible in the darkness.  And at least a 200 feet away. Might as well be in the middle  of the fucking ocean.  He takes a step forward. And stops. His face filling with  fear.  Mare slams the trunk door. Jess already looking into the  darkness.  Mare crawls past her. Grabs the FLASHLIGHT. Turns it  towards the window--scanning, scanning, then:  Stops. We don’t see what she does. Only the horror.  Nate. Where we left him. Now illuminated. Across from:  A HORRIFIC SILHOUETTE. The animal. The first time we truly  understand the size of the beast. Approaching Nate at full  height.  Yet still only a shadow.  Nate’s a sitting duck.  The lion ROARS. Echoing across the grassland.  Mare and Jess watching in horror.  We have to help him.  Looks back at Martin. Unable to do anything. But Nate isn’t  alone out there.  We find Likezo, bleeding from his shoulder, crawling towards  Dodger’s rifle. He reaches for it. Rolls onto his back.  Pulls the bolt as:  Nate. Backs away from the lion. Ever so slowly. Brandishes  the SURVIVAL KNIFE.  Doesn’t see Likezo.  Rise from the grass. The rifle aimed. Follows the light to  clock Nate--  THE ANIMAL.  Mare and Jess look on.  Nate raises the knife--  Likezo aims.  The animal coils to strike.  Everything goes quiet as:  Likezo puts his finger on the trigger.  A beat. The animal charges. Nate YELLS. Likezo fires.  BOOM.  Where we’ll stay. Mare and Jess. BOOM. Mare pulls Jess  away from the window. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.  SILENCE. ROOOOOOOOOOOOAR. SOMEONE SCREAMS.  The light on the Rover floor. We hold. We wait.  She looks at Martin. Then Mare grabs the light. Turns.  Reveal:  Nothing but grass. The horizon.  Mare shakes her head. Tears in her eyes. A horrible beat.  WHAM. Against the window. Jess screams. But it’s not Nate.  Likezo.  Covered in blood. His eyes in the throws of panic. Locked  with Mare’s.  The man slides to the ground. Mare tries to hold it  together.  Then we hear a snarl. A sniff. And the sound of dragging.  Just in time to see Likezo pulled into the grass. The rifle  still clung in his grasp.  Mare, on the verge of falling apart. Trembling. Tears  about to fall, until:  From Martin’s radio. She grabs it off the floor.  On Nate. Crouched down, surrounded by a snarl of craggy  trees.  We reverse to reveal... across the way. A shape in the dark,  the silhouette of a small, raised structure.  Mare lowers the handset. Turns to Martin. He smiles.  Moonlight cuts through the foliage in rays. Nate negotiates  gnarled branches--ever so quiet. We’re sure at any moment  the lion is going to explode from the dark.  But he doesn’t. Yet.  Nate squeezes through. Drops off a felled tree. Pauses.  Mare, Jess, and Martin wait nervously. Mare grips the radio  handset, almost willing her Dad’s voice to come through--  Back to Nate. Coming to the edge of a small, moonlit  clearing. The water to his left. Has to cross it. Into the  open.  About 30 feet. He looks back. Breathes. Makes his move.  Low runs across. His footsteps like thunder. Slides into  cover. Waits. Breath held.  A painful beat.  Then exhales. Relief. But as he prepares to go.  His blood runs cold. A sound. Approaching--from his front.  The lion. Though it doesn’t see Nate. And he barely sees  it. Partially hidden in the trees.  Moving idly. Sniffing.  Ever so cautiously, Nate eases himself behind a stump.  Above, a gust of wind. The crack of branches and the whoosh  of leaves.  The lion looks up briefly. Painfully. Nate waits.  Then the animal passes behind--like a ship in the night.  Nate rises slowly, looks back. The animal is gone.  But the next step changes everything.  The radio. Hooked to his belt. Catches on a bush. He  doesn’t notices until:  STATIC. The volume turned up to max level. He might as well  have screamed. Nate kills the sound.  But it’s too late. A crashing in the bush. He spins. Fuck  me.  Mare looks at the radio. She heard it too.  Martin shakes his head. A beat.  Close on the radio. Now lying on the ground.  But Nate is gone. We hold. Then movement in the background.  Just the rattle of a bush. The lion emerges.  We crane up with his arrival to reveal Nate. Perched in a  tree. The lion below him. The first time we’ve seen a  bird’s eye view.  You think Jaws swimming under the boat was spooky.  The animal is bigger then we could’ve ever imagined. Long as  a car--the wire spun muscles visible in the dapple moonlight.  He stops to sniff the radio. Paws at it. Growls.  The response comes in bursts. The weight of the Lion’s paw  keys the mic. Intermittently. But the sound is clear.  A low throated Growl. She looks at Martin.  Where Nate clings desperately to the branch. Muscles aching.  The lion still below.  But only it gets worse. Nate isn’t alone in the tree.  HISSSSSSS. Coiled in the branches and on the move. A BLACK  MAMBA. Nate freezes. The snake moves across the branch, now  gliding over his hand.  He closes his eyes. The fucking lion still below. He can’t  move. He can’t scream. A beat.  Finally, the lion moves away.  The moment he’s gone. Nate grabs the snake. A lightning  strike.  And tosses it:  To the ground. Where it lands. In the foreground. Hisses.  And Nate drops quietly from the tree. Scoops the radio. And  Where Mare is beside herself. *  The painful truth. As she looks back at:  Not around. But in. The water is inky black. Like glass.  And then ripples. We find Nate.  His head just above the water. Like Martin Sheen in  Apocalypse Now. The back pack floats in front of him--the  knife in his teeth.  He moves painfully slow. Carefully. The bank just ahead.  The blind only fifty feet from it.  But it’s exposed. He stops at the edge of the water. The  lip of the bank about 3 feet up. He GENTLY lifts the pack  and sets it on the grass.  About to climb. Then stops. Thinks better of it. The open  space. Something about the surrounding bush.  Too exposed. He needs cover, a distraction, something like--  MUD. Black, sticky.  He’s covered in it. His arms. His legs. Only the whites of  his eyes.  Then he emerges. Pulling himself from the water. But he  doesn’t rise. He stays low.  Military style. Closing the distance to the BLIND.  But he’s only half way there, when:  CRACK. A branch under his elbow. Of course. He freezes. A  Then that the familiar sound. That snarl. Low. Nate goes  still. Flat against the ground.  We stay CLOSE. We hold. Then a shape in the background.  The lion. He comes towards us. Nate’s a sitting duck.  Except. The animal doesn’t see him. Can’t smell him. A  massive, clawed paw steps inches from Nate’s face.  That’s where the animal stops. Nate holds his fucking  breath.  We pan up. The animal’s jaws are directly above. So close  that it’s saliva drips onto Nate’s cheek.  It’s unbearable. The man. The lion.  Something has to give. And finally. Mercifully. It does.  Because in the distance. We hear:  WHAM. WHAM.  The lion looks.  WHAM. WHAM.  And trots off. Nate breathes. The sound continues and we  go:  The source. Mare slams her hand on the door. *  A drum beat. WHAM. WHAM. WHAM. Then. *  She looks back. Static from the radio. A beat. *  She grabs the radio.  She closes her eyes. Thank god.  Inside... A small room. He spots the lock box. She smiles  with relief.  We stay with her. She lowers the radio. Looks at Martin.  The expression on his face. Not relief. Not even close.  She turns just in time to see him. The lion coming out of  the darkness. Full speed. He leaps. Right at the broken  The force of it JOLTS the rover. Actually dislodging it from  the ROCKS. She’s throttled back. Slams against the  passenger door. Jess and Martin tossed.  Mare pinned to the passenger side. But it’s all gnashing  teeth and razor claws. Trapped inside a tiny space. Our  worst fucking nightmare.  The animal is trying to squeeze inside. She kicks at it.  Jess looks on in horror. Her sister, screaming--  SUDDENLY THE ROVER MOVES. The lion is pushing it towards the  edge of the river bed, the DROP OFF.  MARE.  HELP ME, PLEASE!  That’s when a claw swipes her abdomen. She fucking screams.  Then kicks hard at the animal.  As Frenzied as he is. Suddenly he pulls back. And with him  goes the entire fucking door.  Close on the PAD LOCK. Nate shoves his knife between the  lock and the wood. Then steps back. Kicks the handle. It  cracks.  He pries it open... inside are blankets--  Batteries... all kinds of useless shit. He pulls it all out  with ferocity. It was all for nothing. A beat. He sees. A  FLASHLIGHT. Grabs it. Turns it on. Has to tap it.  He searches the place. It’s empty.  At a loss. About to loose it. When he sees something out of  the corner of his eye. Not in the blind, but out.  He crosses to the little view box. As we go:  CLOSE ON: Mare. On the verge. Tears in her eyes. She looks  down at her abdomen. Pulls her hand away. BLOOD. LOT OF  IT.  She looks. Can’t see Martin. Only her wide eyed sister.  She turns. Sees the door is gone. Then a shadow in the  moonlight. The animal approaches slowly.  Now he can fit inside.  With Nate as moves away from the blind into the grass.  Quickly. Then we see what he did. *  A splatter of blood. A strip of cloth. He turns, scans the  grass.  Reveal the rifle. Right where Martin dropped it.  A giant paw steps onto the seat. Mare, in catatonic horror,  as the lion enters the car. Snarling the whole way. Mare  can’t look away. His golden eyes. *  Fucker’s gonna slow play this. Within inches. His jaw  hinges back. Her delicate neck. That’s when it happens.  SCREAM--NO--BATTLE CRY. WHACK.  Jess nails the lion square in the face with the tire iron.  The creature thrashes. Dislodging the rover. Pulls back.  We hear a groan. We feel the world move. The rover.  Perched on the edge. Suddenly it tips. Rolls. Once, twice,  into the river bed.  SMASH. Upside down. We hold. Then a massive ROAR.  Nate looks up from the rifle. The ROAR reverberating. He  realizes. Takes off back towards the Rover as we go:  Mare’s eyes open. She sees Martin. A finger to his lips.  He’s got his hand around Jess’s mouth.  Then she hears a groan. The animal is pushing on the car.  We see its paws through the shattered windows. Sniff, sniff,  sniff. Right behind her.  She’s frozen to the spot. Her eyes locked on Martin.  Then he nods back. She looks at him, questioning. His face  pale, but determined. Then one, whispered word.  That’s when he climbs out of the rover as we go:  Nate sprints through trees. The rover still isn’t visible.  With Martin as he hobbles away from the rover. In ungodly  pain. He looks back over his shoulder. Now a good distance  away. He stops. Looks back. As:  Emerge from the Rover. See Martin. A look between them.  Then they run in the opposite direction.  Watches them go. A beat.  Then as if to answer. A growl. The lion approaches.  Martin falls to his knees. The lion draws closer.  The size of him compared to Martin is unreal. Martin looks *  in his eyes. *  But he’s cut off as the lion charges and takes him down. *  Martin screams-- *  Mare and Jess hear him SCREAM. They stop. Look back. We  hold on them. Exposed. Tears in their eyes. Then they’re  grabbed from behind.  Nate.  Hugging them both. He looks back towards where Martin last  screamed.  and Nate and Jess’s rushing footfalls as they run away from  the watering hole. The terror.  Miles of grass ahead of them.  Nate palms the rifle. Back pack over his shoulder, other  hand holding Jess. But it isn’t long until we realize.  He’s practically dragging her, because:  He turns. Mare stumbles, clutching her abdomen. She falls.  He goes to her. She looks up, her eyes like moonlit dinner  plates. She pulls her hand away from her mid section.  So much blood. We didn’t realize how bad it was.  But the conversation is short lived because:  He turns--sees what she does. The lion on a bee-line. 250  feet and closing fast. Nate drops the pack. Raises the  rifle. Stands.  The lion in his sights. For a moment he hesitates. But he  has no choice.  He fires. CRACK. The shot echoes in the vastness. Misses.  CRACK. Misses again. The animal obscured in the grass.  One last shot. A deep breath. CLICK.  The lion still coming. Full sprint.  Nate lowers the weapon. But he doesn’t tear his eyes away.  No more than a hundred feet away. Charging.  Nate tosses the gun. For a moment we wonder if he’s going to  take on this fucker hand to hand.  But no. There’s a reason humans are the top of the food  chain.  Nate reaches in the pack and pulls a flare. He pops the end.  The lion like a blood soaked predator torpedo.  We go WIDE. PROFILE. A man with a flare facing down a  charging lion. An epic game of chicken. Back on Nate.  Waits. Waits. And as the lion is about to go airborne.  Nate tosses the flare into the tinder dry grass....  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH.  It goes off like a match book. The lion skids. But it’s  engulfed in flames. It roars.  The fire spreads fast. Like the great wall of Africa.  Nate watches the world burn. The lion with it. He turns  back to Mare and Jess.  Their eyes reflected in the firelight. It’s over. The  moment holds as we:  BAM. The door is kicked open. The family in silhouette  against the FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN. Mare’s arm over his  shoulder. He guides her inside and helps her into one of two  chairs.  Takes the other chair, shuts the door, and jams it under the  broken handle. Then flips on the lights.  We’re in a visitor’s center. National park type photos on  the walls. A desk. Behind it is a door marked STORAGE ROOM.  Two hallways lead back into the building. One door with  EMPLOYEES ONLY, the other is open, a sign indicating  RESTROOMS this way.  Nate immediately crosses to a FIRST AID BOX on the wall.  Rips it open. Grabs the KIT--  Then a SMALL fridge under the desk. Bottles of water.  Mare watches. Hand covering her blood soaked tank top. He  moves back to her. Hands them each a bottle.  They both drink as Nate opens the KIT.  Let me see.  Mare takes her hand away. The GASH is a jagged six inches.  The aid kit is rudimentary. He pulls gauze, places it on the  wound.  She nods.  A beat. Now it’s her turn. She can’t find the words.  He nods. Crosses to the Employees Only door. Mare’s eyes on  him. He looks back one more time.  Then pushes open the door:  And flips on the lights. A long hallway, several doors on  either side. He checks the first door, but it’s locked.  The second too.  But the third to his right is open. As he enters we go:  On Mare. She stares ahead. At what we’re not sure. She  stands with a struggle. Jess crosses.  We reverse to reveal:  Those national park photos. Animals. With descriptions,  physiology, mating, etc.  She focuses on a photo of a male lion. It’s mane. Looking  regal. This affects her.  They don’t look so scary now, do  they?  and greens and whites. *  Jess looks back. Smiles then sees: *  A vending machine-- *  Back to Nate. Going through cabinets, the desk drawers *  already pulled out. He comes up empty. Turns and we follow  him:  To the next office, the door is locked. He pivots, a final  office. The door opens. There on the desk, a SAT PHONE.  Thank god. He goes:  Tries to power it on. But the PHONE’S dead. Several  batteries in a charging station. He pops out the battery,  replaces it.  He pushes the power button. Nothing, tries another batter. *  Nothing. The final one-- *  The LCD screen comes alive. Searching for signal. *  That’s when he hears it. A door in the wind. Nate steps *  out. He grabs a mop handle and breaks it off. Uses DUCT *  TAPE to create a MAKESHIFT spear. *  Looks back where he came from. But that wasn’t the source of *  the sound. CREEEEEEEEAK. It’s coming from the other *  direction. The end of the hall. We follow him: *  But don’t see what he does. Only the blood draining from his *  face. The back door open in the wind. *  Then another sound. This one farther away. SNUFFLING. *  Oh shit. He turns. He raises the radio-- *  CLOSE ON THE RADIO. We see the light blinking. But the *  sound is turned down. Rack to: *  Mare and Jess unaware of their father’s discovery. Jess has *  her arm in VENDING MACHINE, trying to get chips-- *  Success. She grins. *  Jess tries a chip. *  Mare grins. Tries one too. *  That’s when she sees something in the reflection of the *  vending machine. Movement. Down the hall. Off her look: *  With Nate, moving deliberately. The HUNTING KNIFE, his only *  protection. *  Pauses. Darkness to his right. Then: *  That sound again. Shuffling. There’s a wetness to it. *  He locates the light switch. Turns it on to illuminate. *  TWO HYENAS, looking up from something on the ground. Their *  blood soaked muzzles, gristle hangs from jaws. They growl-- *  The hyenas take off. When he looks back.... *  The ground is covered with bones. Zebra, antelope, buffalo. *  Human. He realizes, already on the move: *  Empty now. The girls are gone. We hold. Then the door *  slowly opens to reveal: *  Our lion. He limps from the gunshot wound in his right *  shoulder. His fur is matted black. A burn scar on the side *  of his body. His face. *  We pan across. Mare and Jess hiding behind the couch. In *  gut wrenching fear. They can only hear what we can see. *  Whispered horror. *  It’s getting closer. *  But Mare is looking at a small trashcan, just within reach of *  her foot. *  WITH THE LION now. As it sniff the floor. The chip wrapper. *  THE GIRLS *  Jess nods. Mare breathes. And kicks the trash can. The *  lion pivots-- *  Nate stops. He heard that. *  Mare and Jess in mid sprint. Lion behind them. Running for *  their fucking life. No idea where they’re going. Hit the *  end of the hall. Take a hard right. *  The lion slip-slides on the floor. Smashes into the wall *  behind them. They keep going. Don’t know where this leads. *  Careen down another HALL. MORTAL TERROR. They reach the *  end... the door is locked-- *  The lion coming. *  Jess turns. Another door. It opens. *  They try to slam the door behind them. But the lion leaps. *  Collides with the door--they’re blasted backwards. *  Hit the ground. The lion too. Ten feet away. It stares at *  them. Snarls. *  They crab crawl back. Reveal ROWS OF CAGES. Some kind of *  holding. The lion CHARGES. *  They dive into an open cage. Slam the cage door just as the *  lion hits it. Snarls. *  Like being in a shark cage. But the metal built to keep *  animals in--is keeping this one out. Mare pulls jess to her. *  Then they hear-- *  And the lion turns. *  Nate enters slowly. Sees the girls are gone. The abandoned *  radio. Then he notices. Paw prints. Suddenly we hear-- *  Banging. Screaming-- *  Mare and Jess yell through the cage. *  DAD HE’S COMING. *  Nate on the move again--can’t make out the words but hear *  them screaming--he finds the door. The one they went *  through. He pauses--listen-- *  Then pushes open the door. We hold on his look. *  Then the LION LURCHES out, slamming Nate into the wall. *  Nate’s thrust with knife. But he’s too late. He screams. *  We can hear it from outside. Mare slides back an interior *  door on the cage. *  It leads to a shoot--just being enough to crawl through-- *  where the animals can be lead: *  The girls emerge. Jess looks up. A fire extinguisher. *  Find Nate, on the ground. Realing. His arm bitten. He *  spots the knife. Crawls for it. Reveal the lion behind him. *  Limping. Bleeding. It approaches Nate. Then digs his paw *  into it’s ankle-- *  He can’t reach the knife. He turns on his back. Looks into *  the eyes of the monster. Then: *  It’s blasted with the fire extinguisher. The girls are *  there, they help him up, Nate grabes the knife as they run: *  The glare of the sun almost blinding. What they thought was  Now they’re running into the wide open.  And only seconds later. The lion emerges. The grass is  shorter, rockier. Their flight hampered by Mare’s wound,  Nate wounds. *  Luckily the lion is wounded. Not as fast. But pursuing.  They reach the lip of hill, stumbling down. A dry river bed  beneath.  Nate looks.  A SMALL GROVE OF TREES. But they’re blackened, the branches  without leaves. Sentinels of the Savannah. Like  gravestones.  They sprint towards the grove.  The trunks whipping by until, deep in the grove, Nate pulls  his daughters behind a tree.  Mare grimaces, doubled over in pain. This is as far as she  goes and Nate fucking knows it. He hands her the Sat Phone.  Then movement behind them. They look. The lion visible.  Approaching.  Reveal the envelope. *  take her there. *  Their eyes locked. This is the way it has to be. And we go  In full light for the first time. Bigger then we ever  could’ve imagined. More horrific after what we’ve been  through. The worst of creation.  Suddenly he stops. Looks up.  Nate. Stands in view. His make shift spear. Dirty. Blood  stained.  The lion stares at him. Maybe confused. Because there is no  fear in this man.  Nate starts to back away.  The lion steps forward.  Still backing away, leaving the trees. And Mare. Who we  will not see again.  Because this is man vs. Lion. A story as old as Africa.  Suddenly the lions ROARS. And charges.  Nate waits for it. As the lion lunges, he dodges. Stabbing  the lion, the inertia, causes him to roll, breaking off the  knife.  The lion rises.  Nate still backing away. As they emerge from the grove of  trees, he looks behind him. We think we see a glimmer of  water. He turns back.  The lion shakes off the pain. A little unsure now. Nate  breaks the stick over his knee. Two halves. Two sharp ends.  Back peddling slowly.  The lion limps forward. Ten feet and keeping the distance.  The lion charges again. Nate tries to dodge. But a paw  swipe catches him, even though he manages to impale one of  the sticks in the lion’s side.  The animal is up fast. Nate too. Blood pouring from his  shoulder.  Keeps moving backward. The animal charges fast this time.  Nate isn’t able to get the stick up before the lion hits him.  The speed. The power. Astonishing. He falls under the  animal’s weight.  It bites into his collar bone. Skin, muscle.  He SCREAMS. But uses the broken stick to stab into the  lion’s side, once, twice.  The animal reels back--  Nate scrambles up. But he’s really fucking hurt. His arm  shredded from the swipe. The other side of his body mauled.  He stumbles away from the animal. Holding only the stick.  While the lion is hurt. Nate is shredded.  Woozey. Only a blood stained broken stick.  The animal stalks forward. Keeping pace. Nate waves the  sick. It’s feeble. The lion swipes. Misses.  Nate backs up. He swipes again. Now it’s like the lion is  toying with him.  Almost as if it knows it has the upper hand.  The animal’s eyes on him. A low snarl. And for just a  second, we feel something in his animal beyond instinct.  We feel hatred.  The lion CHARGES. Nate looks up. He lunges. Nate thrusts  the stick.  The animal lands on top of him. The stick breaking off in  his breast. The lion rolls still in the mud.  Nate lays there. Bleeding. Did he just kill this fucking  He looks up. A second later. The monster rises. Nate  turns. No longer has the strength to stand. Drags himself  through the mud towards the edge of a WATERING HOLE. The  lion slow-walking behind him.  Finally, mercifully, Nate stops. Rolls onto his back.  There’s something familiar about this place. The rocks. The *  trees. We’ve been here before. *  If Nate knows it, we can’t tell. The lion approaches. Nate *  coughs blood. The shadow of the animal falls over him.  Nate looks into his eyes. And for a moment it doesn’t  attack. It stares at him. And that’s when Nate says the  most unexpected thing.  And just as the lion’s lips curl back. We hear something *  coming. A sound in the water. Both the lion and Nate look *  up to see: *  Racing across the water at full fucking speed. It barrels *  into the monster with a ferocious growl. The monster throws *  But a second one comes from the other direction. We won’t *  know it until later. But the first was SEPO. The second is *  TAVO. *  Yet we stay with Nate. As these two lions fight the Beast, *  This is nature at its most carnal, primitive. The sounds, *  the demonstration of unbelievable strength, these two lions *  dominating the former alpha--doing what Nate could not. *  A final paw swipe and a bite to the neck. *  But we don’t linger. We hold on Nate, who drops back into *  the mud. *  We pull away from him. Into the sky. The corpse of the *  beast. The two male lion standing over him. *  That’s when Tavo ROARS. *  We hold. Then new sounds. Beep. Beep. Beep. *  Nate. His eyes open. We pull back. He’s in a hospital bed.  He gathers. Winces. Then:  He turns to see. His daughters. We are:  The morning sun. Mare’s wounds are dressed. Jess is  showered, clean. The relief on his face is undeniable.  He can’t hide the emotion. They embrace. It lasts.  Finally.  Trackers from the village found  Mare shakes her head. Nate takes this in. It hits him hard. *  Overwhelmed by emotion. His girls. His wife. Martin. *  She nods. *  He closes his eyes. *  And he finally breaks.  Jess climbs into bed with him. *  Mare’s head on his shoulder And we hold on this tableau. *  Bittersweet.  The wind blows across the horizon. We pan across. This  beautiful place. *  Our camera lands on Nate. He stands on the edge of a hill.  Healed now. The girls next to him. *  Reveal two memorial tributes. Stacked stones, flowers. A *  photo of Hannah. A photo of Martin. And the cardboard box. *  The one Nate was staring at. *  She hands him the envelope. He opens it. A pencil drawing *  of vista of the very spot they stand. *  The girls smile. *  Nate and the girls take the cardboard box down the hill to *  the edge of the river. The kneels. *  All three reach inside. Fine white ash. The wind seems to *  kick up... And they let Hannah Samuels spill into the river. *  Then stand. All three. And look. Across the river. The *  beauty of Africa spread out before them. *
