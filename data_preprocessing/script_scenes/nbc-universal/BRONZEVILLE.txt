Fall 1932 A full moon reflects off the Mississippi River. In a clearing not far from its banks sits an old, WOODEN CHURCH. Checking over his shoulder, a BLACK MAN approaches ON FOOT. He knocks on the door. The sound of voices behind the door immediately stop. Nervous - he waits until the door opens a crack. The Black Man shakes his head. The MAN AT DOOR sticks his head out briefly, surveys the surrounding area. Satisfied, he lets the Black Man inside. The Black Man enters the cramped, sweaty one room edifice to a meeting already in progress. He finds a seat in the PEWS that are half-filled with Black men. Their haggard, thread bare clothes tell us they are not men of means. The calloused hands, dirt permanently stuck under their nails and worn, sun-hardened faces say they’re field hands. Sitting together among them are ARTHUR GRACE, (40s) heavy-set, strong, earnest and JIMMY TILLMAN (30s) hungry and charismatic with a fire in his eye. At the front of the room, AL MORELAND, (white, late 20s) passionate, idealistic, remains silent until the door is shut again. On a TABLE beside him are several staple-bound LITTLE BLUE BOOKS. Some in the audience thumb through copies. Another MAN, LINKWOOD, cuts him off. Murmurs of agreement from the audience. Arthur speaks up. More mutters of agreement and discord throughout the room. Linkwood leaves. As do a few others. As the door closes... As Moreland continues, Jimmy whispers to Arthur. They say it at the same time. But with very different levels of enthusiasm. They share a laugh. * The room falls silent as everyone strains to listen. There is the unmistakeable sound of CAR ENGINES idling. And then... CRAAAAAASSSSHHHHH!!!! A ROCK WRAPPED IN A FLAMING RAG crashes through a BACK WINDOW. Another FLAMING ROCK SMASHES through the OTHER BACK WINDOW. Pandemonium erupts as EVERYONE SCATTERS. People knock each other over running for the front door. Pews tumble. The table with the Little Blue Books is kicked over. Arthur starts for the front door, but Jimmy pulls him toward the back. Jimmy rears up and KICKS the BACK DOOR open ...the door flies out SMASHING a white UNION BUSTER in the face. BLOOD GUSHES from his nose. He drops his SHOTGUN. Jimmy dashes past the Union Buster who is cupping his ruined face in his hands. He sprints for the tree line with Arthur. Several other WHITE UNION BUSTERS emerge from the side of the church and run after Arthur and Jimmy. As they disappear into the tree line, MORE UNION BUSTERS beat the fleeing sharecroppers BLOODY with BATS and STICKS around the front of the church where most of the Union Busters were waiting to attack. Arther and Jimmy tear through the woods. Jimmy is a little ahead of Arthur. Even running through dense foliage lit only by moonlight, there is a precision with which he moves. Arthur not so much. The big man’s FOOT catches on an UPTURNED ROOT. He goes down HARD. Jimmy turns back for him. Arthur grimaces as he clutches his ankle. Jimmy starts helping him to his feet. He gets him to his feet. Turns to continue, but a WHITE MAN wielding a CROW BAR, blocks their path. Arthur and Jimmy turn. Another white man, SAP MAN, has approached from behind. He wields a BUCHEIMER BLACKJACK SAP. A look passes between Jimmy and Arthur. Jimmy undrapes Arthur’s arm from his shoulders and leaves him to stand on his own. He raises his hands plaintively. Whatever Jimmy’s got to say bears no interest to White Man. He SWINGS his Crow Bar HARD. Jimmy barely dodges the blow. Arthur musters all his strength and leaps toward Sap Man who swings the sap and connects. But Arthur is able to absorb the blow with his heavy shoulders. Sap Man is surprised by his strength. They struggle over the sap. Jimmy dodges another blow. White Man swings wildly again. This time Jimmy lets the bar come dangerously close and then steps past the arc of the White Man’s follow through. He surprises White Man with a quick JAB to the face. And another set of rapid fire blows. The man drops his weapon as Jimmy continues to back him up. The sap goes flying. Arthur and Sap Man fall to the ground. Arthur maneuvers to get on top of him where his weight will give him the advantage. But Sap Man has another idea. He reaches for the SMITH & WESSON MODEL 10 REVOLVER tucked in his waist band. Arthur’s eyes go WIDE. He grabs for the gun. Jimmy PUNCHES White Man with ALL HIS MIGHT. He FALLS to the ground unconscious. Just as Jimmy turns to help Arthur... BANG!!! BANG!!! Sap Man pushes a BLOODIED, GUT SHOT Arthur off of him and FIRES at Jimmy. TREE BARK explodes just behind Jimmy’s head as he DIVES out of the way. Sap Man scrambles to his feet FIRING ANOTHER SHOT at Jimmy who scurries out of sight - grabbing the crow bar as he goes. Jimmy takes refuge behind a BIG TREE. He braces himself; ready to swing. Eyes whipping everywhere. Straining to hear. MOMENTS LATER A BOOT hesitates over a TWIG. Then sets down silently just to it’s side. Sap Man approaches as stealthily as he can. Gun cocked and ready. Up ahead - at the base of the Big Tree, he sees just the TIP of JIMMY’S SHOE. He approaches in silence and then whips around the trunk BLASTING into...air. He looks down at two EMPTY SHOES. And looks up just in time to see the CROW BAR as it careens toward his... THWOCCCK - the unmistakable sound of metal fracturing skull. Jimmy, SOCKS ONLY adorning his feet, stands over the fallen man. He swings the bar twice more to be sure. Then drops the blood stained instrument. Picks up the gun. And his shoes. Arthur is BLEEDING OUT in the spot where Sap Man left him. Jimmy crouches next to him. Rocks him awake. He stirs. Weak. Jimmy tries pulling him up again. But he just slumps in his arms. Dead with his eyes open. Jimmy realizes. Takes his moment. Closes his friend’s eyes. MOMENTS LATER Jimmy’s SOCK CLAD FOOT kicks White Man until he stirs. He opens his eyes. He sees Jimmy standing over him holding Sap Man’s gun at his side. White Man looks around and sees the slumped corpse of Sap Man. He starts scooting backward on his hind parts. Jimmy raises the gun. Points it right at the man’s head. He SQUEEZES the TRIGGER. We’re on a BUSTLING AVENUE we will come to know as THE * STROLL. The sidewalk is teeming with storefronts of * BOUTIQUES, SHOPS and RESTAURANTS. Cars are crushed together. * Folks dresses in their SUNDAY BEST are out on the town. * A large MARQUIS fixated above the roof of a fancy restaurant bears the name “Copeland’s.” We drift past the sign into... ...an alley. Narrow. Dark. Empty except for BILLY (mid 20s), bluster masking fear, who stands with TWO BURLY DUDES. He tries and fails to light a CIGARETTE. He cuts himself short as a BACK DOOR opens. LIGHT spills into the alley as TWO SILHOUETTED FIGURES emerge. The first, EVERETT COPELAND (mid 30s), an impeccably and conservatively dressed businessman who prides himself on being reasoned, pragmatic, smarter than the next guy, steps uncomfortably close to the scared young man. Billy looks over Everett’s shoulder at JESSE (30), Everett’s younger brother. He’s good looking, but his nose has clearly been BROKEN a number of times. His suit fits, but not just so like his brother. He stares at Billy - a promise of violence. Billy swallows his words. Nods instead. Billy mumbles something unintelligible. Jesse starts * UNBUTTONING his jacket. * Everett slides a WAD OF CASH out of his pocket and into Billy’s shirt pocket. Billy takes off full speed down the alley. Everett and Jesse head back inside... ...the elegant, high-end restaurant that bares their name. Everett speaks to the MAITRE’D who holds the door open. As they move away from him, toward a private dining room... * A small intimate dinner in a room designed for royalty. * EZEKIEL “ZEKE” COPELAND (28), playboy, hedonist, the youngest * and most irresponsible of the Copeland Brothers, launches a CHAMPAGNE CORK across the room. wise, traditional woman who is always in-charge, secretly or not, gently reprimands her son. Next to her, the baby, LISA “LILI” COPELAND (25) intelligent eyes, earnest and at the moment quiet. He puts down the glass he poured and sits chastened. An ATTENDANT opens the door as Everett and Jesse enter. * Eloise sits unmoved. Zeke throws back some champagne. A sudden, quiet KNOCK on the door breaks the tension. The Maitre’D enters tentatively. He is dragging a PHONE with a LONG CHORD with him. Everett takes the phone. WHAAAAAM!!!! SWEAT DROPLETS leap off a MAN’S FACE as a LEATHER BOXING MITT SMASHES into it. The Man stumbles backwards. He manages to get his MITTS up in a defensive position as his opponent, JOE LOUIS BARROW (18), skinny but ripped, maybe angry, stalks toward him and unleashes a fusillade of punishing blows. The two are in a ring in the middle of a modest, well-kept boxing gym. FOUR OBSERVERS, obscured by shadow, watch from the upstairs office window. The office is dark, smoky. Thick tension sits on the room. Everett and Jesse talk with fellow Policy Kings, LUCKY SMITH (45) and JOHN “ROXY” ROXBOROUGH (40), Joe’s manager. Jesse’s not finished. He storms out of the office. Slamming the door behind him. Everett watches after him a beat. Roxy exits. On Everett, asking the same question. An UPSCALE BACHELOR’S PAD. There are framed photos everywhere * of Zeke with his arm draped around or lifting glasses with * luminaries of the day like ROBERT ABBOTT, LOUIS ARMSTRONG, * WALTER BARNES, JELLY ROLL MORTON, WILLIAM EDOUARD SCOTT, an * assortment of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN including a not yet famous * KATHERINE DUNHAM and POLICY KINGS like POLICY SAM, MUSHMOUTH * JOHNSON and THE JONES BROTHERS. The COUCH is the finest * leather. The TABLE, BAR - SOLID MACASSAR EBONY. All the * LIQUOR - TOP SHELF. The latest and most expensive PHONOGRAPH * PLAYER AND RADIO and several ROLLEIFLEX CAMERAS adding a * distinct panache to the place. * A man and WOMAN’S CLOTHES are DISCARDED haphazardly across * the floor from the front door to the couch. The Woman (20s) * voluptuous, uninhibited, is bent over said couch screaming in delight as Zeke fucks her from behind. It sounds like they’re close to finishing. Unfortunately... CRAAAAASH - the DOOR JAM splinters as A LARGE MAN KICKS in the FRONT DOOR. The Woman attempts to cover herself with her arms as Zeke spins and instinctively tries to pull his PANTS up from around his ankles. He levels a REMINGTON .45 CALIBER M1911 at Zeke who slowly stands back up - hands raised in the air - careful to place his body between the Woman and the gun. FRANK “BETTER OFFER” BARNES, (40s) a stylish gentleman with a * cold heart, steps into the apartment. Large Man lowers the weapon. The Woman cuts Zeke a look. He shrugs. The Woman quickly slides past Zeke, covering her nakedness as best she can as she grabs a few of her garments off the floor and scurries out the door. Better Offer tips his hat and closes the door behind her while Zeke buttons his pants. Large Man COCKS BACK THE HAMMER. Better Offer just shakes his head. He leaves. On Zeke, looking stressed for the first time. A crisp, autumn day. * Nestled on the historic, well-manicured 5900 block of South * Park Avenue, the Copeland Mansion sits kitty corner to the former home of Chicago’s 1st Black banker, Jesse Binga. Eloise calls to the WHITE DRIVER waxing the CADILLAC. She heads into... ...the massive foyer and heads up the stairwell. Her hand holds a beautiful HAND-CARVED BANNISTER as she ascends. Art by prominent and yet-known Negro artists of the day hangs on the walls. Among them are pieces by HENRY OSSAWA TANNER, ARCHIBALD MOTLEY, WILLIAM H. JOHNSON and early works by CHARLES WHITE. In the center of them all is an OIL PORTRAIT of a YOUNGER ELOISE with her late husband, ROYAL COPELAND, a handsome, if not stern, officious looking man. They are surrounded by Everett, Jesse, Zeke and Lisa when * they were much younger. In the painting, Lisa looks to be * about 8 years old. * Eloise pushes down the long hallway adorned with more Black art. She passes “Girl in a Green Dress” by William H. Johnson before she opens a door without knocking and enters... ...interrupting Lisa who is trying to mask her nerves in chiffon. She stands in front of an elegant FULL LENGTH MIRROR staring at the FLORAL PRINT DRESS she’s wearing. It is modest and professional. Just slightly more daring than the GREEN DRESS she’s holding up to consider. * She starts out the room, but pauses at the door. On Lisa, annoyed at every bit of her mother’s counsel. Like the rest of the house, the kitchen is extremely well * appointed. The most MODERN FIXTURES embedded in the classic * architecture. * Jesse is in the kitchen stuffing BILLS into a DISLODGED WOOD PANEL along the base of the cabinet. He looks grim. Eloise walks in and surprises him. He replaces the wood and stands up. He bolts the kitchen. Eloise picks up the PHONE and dials.  Morning. Everett and Jesse are at * Cargo packed in stacks of WOODEN CRATES jostle rhythmically in the dark, crowded box car. Jimmy Tillman sits amongst them. He looks as if he has not slept. He wears the same clothes from the ruined meeting several nights before. He’s face is streaked with TEARS. He wipes his face. Approaches the sliver of DAYLIGHT slipping through the CRACK in the BOX CAR DOORS. Cautiously, he peers through the opening. This is not Arkansas. The station itself is HUGE. An ENORMOUS MASS OF PEOPLE crowd around the tracks awaiting the oncoming TRAIN. More, it seems than the entire population of Arkansas. There are COLORED, WHITE, ASIAN and HISPANIC PEOPLE - each group circled in an enclave of its own. Many await loved ones. Or have tickets and baggage of their own and plan to board the train for its next destination. Then there are the PEDDLERS, VALETS, CABBIES, PORTERS, POLICY WRITERS and OTHER HUSTLERS who have all descended on this crush of humanity in hopes of making their daily bread. PAPER BOYS loudly hawk their respective NEWSPAPERS: the Chicago Tribune, Chicago American, Chicago Daily Times. The group of BLACK PAPER BOYS that sell THE CHICAGO DEFENDER, no doubt aware that their paper is in the middle of a very intentional campaign to draw Southern Blacks to Chicago, are among the loudest of them all.  Defender! Get your Defender! There’s also the BULLS, a group of white men wielding BILLY CLUBS who have a particular interest in the cargo cars of the train. One of which has scrawled on its side: “Farewell - We’re Good and Gone. Bound for the Promised Land.” The train BELCHES SMOKE as it grinds to a halt and announces itself with a LOUD WHISTLE. The Bulls start moving toward the various cargo cars. Jimmy spies the Bulls fanning out. A couple approach his car. He retreats back into the shadows. The Bulls throw the doors to Jimmy’s car open. Even fully illuminated by daylight, Jimmy is nowhere in sight. BULL 1 jumps inside and starts walking through the stacks, looking around, indiscriminately tapping the crates with his BILLY CLUB to see if they sound odd. He is approaching a PARTICULAR CRATE towards the far end of the car when he hears... Bull 1 immediately turns and jumps off the car. He and Bull 2 join the others in running after a STOWAWAY. The LID pops off of that particular crate. From inside, Jimmy quickly lowers the lid to the floor and climbs out. Jimmy sticks his head out the box car door. He sees the crowd dispersing as the Stowaway tries to run away. But the Bulls catch him and proceed to BEAT HIM MERCILESSLY. While almost everyone’s distracted, Jimmy slips off the train and quickly approaches the crowd. One man, CASPER(30), a dandy sporting a GOLD POCKET WATCH and a matching GOLD TOOTH, clocks him while he talks to a female POLICY CUSTOMER. * She laughs as she digs for change. For Jimmy, it’s easy to get lost in a crowd this size. He notices TICKETED BLACK PASSENGERS disembarking the train in droves. There are joyous and tearful reunions all over the platform. Jimmy tucks his head and continues moving briskly toward the exit hoping to go unnoticed. He walks by CASPER who is finishing the exchange of a POLICY SLIP for a NICKEL with the * female customer. Casper excuses himself and follows after * Jimmy. Jimmy ignores him. Casper falls in step. Jimmy hesitates. Casper offers his megawatt smile. The glint from the sun bouncing off his gold tooth is almost blinding. They start walking. A beehive of patrons swarms in and out of Bronzeville’s own * DEPARTMENT STORE. Across State Street, nestled on the corner * in the shadow of the Bates Building sits Chicago United. A * large HAND PAINTED SIGN on the open brick wall of the adjacent building says “INVEST IN YOUR OWN AT CHICAGO UNITED * SAVINGS & LOAN.” * Sunlight streams through LARGE, ARCHED WINDOWS bathing the * bank’s mid-day rush in warm light. Every teller, manager and * customer is Colored. Towards the back of the main floor, Lisa, now wearing the GREEN DRESS, sits at a desk strategically positioned in front of a CLOSED OFFICE DOOR with the words “MANAGER” stenciled across the frosted glass. She is talking to an older customer, MR. FERGUSON (60s) feeble and distraught. He leans unsteadily on a CANE. Lisa stands and starts steering him over to the waiting area. Lisa turns. Sees what he sees. Her older brother, Everett, striding into the bank as if he owns it. Some customers point him out; others tip their hats. A few pretend not to see him, but what’s clear is that everybody notices as he passes. Moving as quickly and casually as she can, Lisa returns to her post and sits just before Everett arrives. Everett abruptly counts out SEVERAL BILLS onto her desk. Lisa smiles wryly as she stands. Raps quietly on the door. Just before she cracks the door, Everett offers... On Lisa, wry smile erased. Now more annoyed than ever. The office is decorated with more taste and capital than one would expect in a bank manager’s office. Everett and CURTIS “EYEBALL” RANDOLPH (50s), regal, a * gangster turned statesman dressed in an exquisite IMPORTED * ITALIAN SUIT, talk in hushed tones. It’s clear, he’s more * Everett raps the desk. Randolph moves to the wall. Flips back a painting, “The Good * Shepherd” by Tanner. Behind it, a HIDDEN SAFE. He starts * removing CASH. Randolph hands him a FEW BRICKS OF CASH. He stops. On Everett, knowing that it’s true. * The Northside. Most of the commuters are Caucasian. LESTER DANIELS (30s) aka THE MANAGER leaves the office building and approaches an awaiting PACKARD on the curve. A NEGRO DRIVER holds the door open and closes it behind him. Lester Daniels reads the CHICAGO TRIBUNE as the car cruises along. He notices that the car passes his turn. * The Negro Driver does not respond or look up. It is odd. As he speaks, he raises a REVOLVER so Lester can see it. Then lays it on the seat next to him. On Lester, silent now. And afraid. Jimmy and Casper walk through a rough part of the Southside. The block is lined with STORE FRONTS and TENEMENT BUILDINGS in varying stages of disrepair. A RADIO broadcasts Jack L. * Cooper’s “The All Negro Hour” from an OPEN WINDOW. It is all breathtaking to Jimmy - who has not seen a section of a city of this magnitude filled with nothing but Negroes. There are some BUMS here and there, but also many Negroes driving cars and trucks, hustling their wares from the corners. One such brother, a NUMBERS RUNNER, is in the middle of a furtive transaction with an OLD WOMAN. She is handing him some MONEY when a BEAT COP rounds the corner. The Numbers Runner drops her CHANGE on the ground and takes off - running away from the Beat Cop who gives chase. Jimmy laughs. * They turn off the main drag into an alley. TWO ROUGH MEN brandishing KNIVES step from the SHADOWS. Jimmy’s hands move toward his waist. Rough Man 2 charges. Jimmy starts to pull the Smith & Wesson, but Casper grabs his hand - stopping him - before he can pull it all the way out. Rough Man now has his KNIFE at Jimmy’s throat. * He flashes his gilded smile. He rifles his pockets. Drops a couple of CRUMPLED BILLS. The two men run off. Jimmy starts picking up the money off the ground. Copeland’s Haberdashery sits in the middle of a bustling block known as Whiskey Row years ago when it was the center of the city’s Red Light District. Now it is a brisk * commercial district filled with Black-owned businesses. * One PATRON races toward the storefront. A surprisingly large group of CUSTOMERS are gathered in the * front room of this tailor’s shop in the middle of the afternoon. That is because despite the presence of SEWING MACHINES, MANNEQUINS and WORK COUNTERS that are the tell-tale signs of a tailoring business, most are not gathered to get their trousers hemmed. A RADIO in the shop is also carrying WSBC’s broadcast of “The All Negro Hour,” but no one’s really listening. All eyes are focused on the back corner of the room where the POLICY BANKER, a formidable, stern looking man packing a BARELY CONCEALED GUN, stands watching over the crowd. He calls to a LOOKOUT hanging by the front door. The Lookout, also STRAPPED, briefly steps outside and looks over the block. He steps back in and gives the ALL CLEAR SIGN to the Policy Banker. He positions himself so he BLOCKS the door. Which he LOCKS. The radio is TURNED OFF. A DRAPE is removed from the back counter revealing a small WOODEN BARREL (aka the “WHEEL”.) A BLIND-FOLDED POLICY WRITER begins spinning the Wheel which has almost 80 small NUMBERED RUBBER CAPSULES inside. He is flanked by the Policy Banker who stands ready to take the capsules from the Writer as he pulls them out. Ponds is also there, positioned near the door to the back office. Like the Policy Banker, he is ARMED. The room is LOUD and ELECTRIC. The Policy Writer stops the spin and begins to draw the first number. The hopeful * Customers, most of whom clutch POLICY SLIPS, alternately call * out the numbers they are hoping for, close their eyes in prayer or make other petitions to Higher Powers for a financial blessing. Everything goes silent when the Policy Banker looks over to the back office door as Everett Copeland steps out. Everett calls to the Banker... ...and the organized noise continues. He speaks to Ponds. Everett closes the door. Crosses to his desk and picks up the phone. His leg jack hammers the floor as he dials. On Everett, wondering if there’s going to be a fight. This building is beyond fucked. Pools of stagnant water. * Holes in walls. Boarded windows. Rats. Unfinished floors. Not a place anyone wants to hang out. No one that is, except Jesse Copeland. He sits on a couple of STACKED APPLE CRATES - a picture of serenity. A door opens and Negro Driver and another HEAVY muscle Lester Daniels through it. He protests as they force walk him to the middle of the floor to stand in front of Jesse. They do so roughly. Heavy grabs Lester’s face in his MASSIVE HAND. He squeezes Lester’s cheeks together so his lips purse and he can’t talk. * Jesse starts unbuttoning his shirt as he speaks. He drops his shirt revealing a WHITE TANK TEE, BUILT FRAME. Lester mumbles something unintelligible. Heavy and Negro Driver step back as Jesse stalks forward. He moves like he spent some time in the ring himself. Lester turns to run, but Heavy and Negro Driver catch him and push him back towards Jesse.... ...who throws his FIRST PUNCH. It snaps Lester’s head back and staggers him backwards. Heavy and Negro Driver help him keep his balance. Jesse unleashes a vicious combination on Lester. Blood erupts from his face. He drops to a knee. Jesse stands over him menacing - no longer masking his rage. Lester raises his hand signaling mercy or something, but Heavy and Negro Driver just stand him to his feet. There is a look of a evil joy in Jesse’s eyes. His lips curl into a smile as he approaches for another assault. The 44th Mayor of Chicago, ANTON J. CERMAK (59), a Czech political brawler with no formal education, sits with his Chief of Staff, FEDIR “FREDDY” BOSKO (50s), salty, of Polish and Ukrainian descent, sipping tea and talking. The Chief of Staff rises and opens the door to the outer office where Curtis Randolph sits in the waiting area across from the Mayor’s SECRETARY. He’s been there for a while. Curtis crosses into the office. There is a slight tinge in the way Bosko says his name. The men shake. Cermak looks puzzled. On Cermak, flummoxed by a Negro that sees himself as equal. Lester Daniel’s face is SWOLLEN and BLOODY. Heavy and Negro Driver hold the barely conscious man up as Jesse continues to beat him. Jesse doesn’t notice the CUTS that have opened on * his hands. * Alternately striking him and taunting him to speak. Lester says something. But he’s so weak, no one can hear it. Jesse leans in close so he can hear the man’s whispers. Lester SPITS BLOOD in Jesse’s face. Jesse loses his shit. Beating the man so wildly, Heavy and * Negro Driver are forced to let go of him. They exchange looks as the men crash to the floor and Jesse continues to pummel the poor man. * They grab Jesse and pull him off Lester. They pull their boss a few feet away and try to calm him down as he struggles against them. He relents. They let go. All three shake it off for a beat. Jesse finally seeming to get control of himself. Then - quicker than either of them can react, Jesse snatches the GUN from Negro Driver’s waist and strides back over to Lester. He pulls him up by the HAIR and slams the barrel of the gun to his temple. He SQUEEZES... Jesse looks up. Letting go of the trigger before it discharges. He sees Everett standing in the doorway. His Driver behind him holding a LEATHER SATCHEL. Jesse says nothing. Jesse considers his brother. The white man whose barely open eyes still regard him with contempt. Jesse wrestles with his bloodlust. And drops the gun. Heavy does as told. While Negro Driver walks a chastened Jesse out past his brother. The two glare at each other. Once Jesse is gone, Everett goes and crouches by Lester. Heavy leaves. He pulls his SILK POCKET SQUARE out his jacket and goes to wipe Lester’s face. The man FLINCHES. Turns away. Lester nods. Everett gently begins to wipe the blood away. WHAAAAAM - Everett SMACKS the words right out of his mouth - * HARD. His eyes narrow to a slit. * Lester nods. * Lester doesn’t respond. He leans into the man. Whispers * something only he and the man can hear. Lester’s face whites. Everett speaks audibly again. Still quiet. Very calmly. Lester Daniels nods, more afraid than he’s ever been. A THICK SALVE is applied with care to the CUTS on Jesse’s hands. Eloise sits next to him at the dining room table tending to his hand while the ELEGANT FEAST that awaits them gets cold. Still pissed, but trying to hide it, Jesse is careful not to look at Everett who sits across the table also working hard not to look at him. Instead, Everett eyes the CLOCK on the wall. Under the table, his leg shakes like it was in the * office. His wife, ESTHER (26), fastidious about rules and quiet to a fault, places a calming HAND on his THIGH to get him to stop. She reiterates the point with her eyes. Also at the table - Lisa, still dressed from work. A BUTLER brings over a few BANDAGES and places them on the table next to Eloise. He disappears back into the kitchen as Eloise continues to work on Jesse’s damaged hand. She casts a look toward the EMPTY CHAIR at the head of the table. Jesse places a tender hand on his mother’s back. Zeke saunters in holding a BOUQUET. He wraps Lisa in a hug. He breaks the hug with Lisa. Heads over to his mother, cheshire stitched to his face. He presents her the bouquet with a flourish. Jesse rolls his eyes. He playfully shushes her, roses still extended to Eloise. She takes them, charmed - despite herself. Silence from all. She stands and heads to the kitchen. As Everett follows his Mom through the door into... ....modern and very well appointed kitchen. She instructs the Butler who is waiting there. He heads into the dining room as Eloise starts opening cabinets from the BUTLER’S PANTRY looking for the right vase. She places the flowers in a vase and splays them out for Everett to admire. On Everett, as Eloise returns to the dining room. WHAAAAAM!!!! BEADS OF SWEAT leap off a Joe Louis’s FACE as a LEATHER BOXING MITT SMASHES into it. The man wearing the mitt, DEWEY SANDERS, (26) white, muscular, several pounds heavier and more experienced than Joe stalks forward. Several BANNERS touting CHICAGO GOLDEN GLOVES are strung up around the space. They’re in Fred Mann’s Rainbo Fronten. The giant SMOKE FILLED ROOM is electric. Negroes and whites alike * cheer the sweet science. * The two warriors battle. Everett, Jesse and Zeke, now dressed the dashing peacock, squeeze through the crowd and find their seats awaiting them in the front next to Lucky and Roxy. POP! A CHAMPAGNE CORK FLIES. Followed by raucous CHEERS from the Southside’s BEST DRESSED and MOST GLAMOROUS, practically all of whom seem to have gathered at The Royale, the Copeland Brothers’ legendary night club in the heart of The Stroll. It is larger and more * tastefully expensive than anyone could imagine for a club * owned by Negroes in 1932. * The Brothers are there, as well as Curtis Randolph, Roxy, Lucky Smith, a number of OTHER POLICY KINGS, their WIVES and * MISTRESSES as well as OTHER LADIES, HUSTLERS, GAMBLERS, ENTREPRENEURS, CRIMINALS, and SQUARES too. As long as they look good and have some dollars to spend - they are among. A band, WALTER BARNES AND HIS CREOLIANS, plays on stage. Zeke Copeland takes the floor, OVERFLOWING CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE in hand. Several WAITERS top off those who are in need.  the next champ - MR. JOE LOUIS!!! Everybody cheers. Roxy nudges Joe who attempts to speak. But the crowd is too loud. Zeke notices and simmers the crowd. Those gathered around the bar erupt in spontaneous cheers. Jimmy, dressed better than before, but clearly working with a limited budget, walks in with Casper. His eyes saucer at the sight of the place; Negroes looking fabulous and dressed to the 9’s. The two blend into the mass of people, just missing Better Offer as he heads over to Zeke who stands with MRS. HAZEL COPELAND (30.) She is stunning, a star in her own right, named for her eyes. Better Offer, shadowed as always by his Large Man, introduces himself. She extends her hand which he takes and kisses. They watch her head over to the band stand. They heads toward the back of the club, not noticing Everett clocking the whole interaction from across the room. He’s talking to Jesse and Randolph. Jesse’s got a few in him. He excuses himself. Goes over to talk to Lucky. Jesse looks out at the sea of Brown. Laughing, drinking, celebrating, free. In their own club. Hazel has now joined the band on stage. She joins them in a vocal rendition of “Birmingham Bertha.” He raises his glass. A beat. Jesse clinks. Spies Zeke * emerging from a back corridor with Better Offer. He steps off to go talk to Zeke just as Casper arrives with Jimmy Tillman in tow. Everett glad hands his way through the club and catches up with Zeke who has already parted ways with Better Offer. He throws an arm around his little brother’s shoulders - walking with him in a tight embrace. Zeke plays cool, but is visibly unnerved. Zeke smiles- silently pleading with his eyes to Everett as Jesse throws his arms around both his brothers. The brothers watch the performance - sincerely mesmerized. Fashionably late and ravishing in a RED DRESS, Lisa saunters into the club. The MAITRE’D practically curtsies when he greets her. She doesn’t get far before Better Offer is on her. Casper SLAMS A SHOT on the stick and motions for another while Jimmy is still holding his, watching him. Casper laughs as he eyes the room. Further down the bar, Casper sees a WOMAN IN A SHORT DRESS revealing beautiful, statuesque legs. Jimmy shakes his head as he scans for his own target. His eyes land on Lisa Copeland. Still hemmed up by Better Offer. Jimmy peels off with his drink. Casper, nervous, slams * another one and signals for two more. Jimmy crosses to Lisa and Better Offer. She walks away. Jimmy watches after her - somehow more intrigued. Better Offer steps into his field of view. Across the room, Ponds rushes over to Everett looking harried. But before he can process that, he turns toward the rising commotion coming from Jimmy and Better Offer. The Brothers look and see the men step to each other. Casper * hurries over. Large Man reaches into his waist band. Jesse * starts to move toward the fracas when suddenly... * The FRONT DOORS of the club are kicked in. Dozens of UNIFORMED COPS pour through the doors brandishing their SERVICE WEAPONS. The music stops. EVERYBODY looks toward the commotion - including The Brothers. And Randolph from the bar. Jimmy and Better Offer separate. Large Man quickly untucks his hand. BUTTONS his JACKET. The Cops disperse through the crowd, roughly searching for someone or something. Into the center of the officers walks OFFICER SYLVESTER “TWO GUN PETE” WASHINGTON (27), a heavy, mean and imposing man whose reputation as beyond brutal is already well on its way to legend. At the sight of him, several hustlers among the crowd begin to voluntarily lay their WEAPONS on the nearest bars and tables. Everybody puts down their DRINKS. Jesse pulls his BROWNING HI-POWER slowly. Opens The action. Puts it on the ground. Jimmy whispers to Casper who has saddled up next to him. On 2 Gun Pete. An audible gasp spreads through the crowd. This is not business as usual. Three UNIFORMS put the Copeland Brothers in HANDCUFFS and walk them through the crowd toward the front doors of the club. Another retrieves Jesse’s pistol from the floor. They stop by 2 Gun Pete. Randolph approaches. Randolph is surprised. He looks to Everett and Jesse who exchange looks. Randolph watches pissed as 2 Gun Pete parades the Copeland Brothers out the door of their own club... ...and into an awaiting PADDY WAGON for all of State Street to see. heart of the Black Belt. But the heart stops beating for the moment, as EVERYBODY on the street watches their Southside Royalty herded like common criminals. The party is over. Everyone stunned, disbelieving. Most of all, Randolph. Better Offer slides up behind Lisa who is still processing the whole thing. Randolph steps over. Places a gentle hand on Lisa’s shoulder. * Randolph shepherds Lisa quickly out the back of the club. * Better Offer watches them go, none too pleased with the * changing landscape. * Jimmy and Casper who are among many patrons that step onto * the street and watch the Paddy Wagon holding Chicago’s * biggest Policy Kings pull away. *
