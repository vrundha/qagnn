 DIRECT PICKUP FROM Episode 116 “The Worthy Dreamer.” OPEN ON  IZZIE, animated.  Our team -- MR. OZ, ALBERT, MATEO, Z BLOB, ZOEY, LOGAN,  COOPER, PHIL, ZIAN, and the DREAMLINGS -- considers this.  With a sweep of her arm, Izzie gestures upwards to the  gorgeous, impressionistic STAINED-GLASS WINDOWS above them.  Sunlight streams in, refracted through the colorful glass.  Um, what am I missing?  ANGLE ON Mateo, staring at the windows, thoughtfully. From  his POV, we see... each window is comprised of different-  sized PANELS (like a MANGA COMIC). Mateo suddenly grins.  It’s like Bunchu and the Attack of  the Killer Goo!  Mateo rolls his eyes but tousles his sister’s hair lovingly.  The others look on, confused.

OZ 19  That is Luna’s best friend, Migo.  From the moment she dreamcrafted  Migo, the two were inseparable.  Seeing the similarities between the Luna/Migo bond and their  own friendship, Mateo and Z Blob exchange a glance.  Sadly, when Luna disappeared, Migo  LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 3.  Z Blob solemnly jiggles in agreement. Suddenly--  BOOM! Loud, ominous THUNDER echoes around the room. For a  beat, everyone freezes in fear.  Zoey hops astride Zian and flaps into the air. She stares out  of the stained-glass windows.  REVERSE to reveal... a NIGHTMARE STORM! Black, billowing  clouds fill the sky. Zian touches back down.  Yeah, it’s a Nightmare Storm. And  it’s approaching fast.  Our team instinctively huddles closer together.  Teo can’t help it, he sneaks a look at Logan.  On cue, the EYE TRACKER on Logan’s HAT BLINKS. Everyone  gapes. Logan slumps, deflated.  Everyone nods as the NIGHT HUNTER’S smug visage swirls into  view within the eye shape on Logan’s hat.  Very astute, Logan. Only a  brainless Dreamchaser would fall  for such an obvious ploy...  The Night Hunter winks out.  LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 4.  Logan rips the hat from his head angrily, unsure what to do  with it. Z Blob grabs the hat and swallows it! [Note: It  dissolves to GREEN GOO as it hits his belly.] 30 MR. OZ 30  Well, that’s one way to destroy a  bugged hat.  Clocking the glum, frightened faces of our team, Mateo steps  forward.  Phil clears his throat and steps forward.  Logan fist-pumps.  Mateo. Everyone else, with Phil.  As the Dreamlings scurry off and Izzie, Albert, Zoey, Logan  and Phil race away, CUT TO:  Hidden within the Nightmare Storm, the MR. SHARKYFACE AIRSHIP  flies towards the Castle. The NIGHTMARE KING stands eerily  still as NIGHTLINGS, including SUSAN, SNEAK, and SNIVEL, race  to and fro aboard the airship.  The Night Hunter slinks up alongside the Nightmare King.  The Nightmare King smiles malevolently.  the Dark Army can do.  The Nightlings let out an unholy CHEER and race to take up  positions. Some notch BOWS with ARROWS; others load CANNONS.  Linger on Sneak looking less than gung-ho as we CUT TO:  Phil, Izzie, Albert, Logan, Zoey, and Zian spill out onto the  Castle’s rampart, and stare in horror at the truly terrifying  sight of the encroaching Nightmare Storm.  With a flourish, Phil whips a sheet off the LIGHT CANNON.  (Retro-futuristic in style.) Zoey whistles, impressed. 45 ZOEY 45  Score one for Dream Keeper Shin.  But when Phil pulls on the cannon’s lever to fire the  cannon... it won’t budge!  Our team stares at the Nightmare Storm, rolling closer.  We need to hurry!  Albert joins Phil and together, they try to tug on the lever.  But try as they might, it doesn’t move an inch. 48 IZZIE 48  Brace yourselves!  Izzie pulls out her hourglass and dreamcrafts her HAMMER. She  swings it over her head...  BOOSH! She brings the hammer down on the lever, which slams  down and fires the cannon!  BAWOOSH! Everyone momentarily shields their eyes as a  blinding BLAST OF LIGHT blazes forth!  ANGLE ON our team as they watch the continuous beam of light  streak through the sky...  FATHOOM! The light beam SLAMs into the Nightmare Storm,  freezing it in place! Phil and Albert high-five. 50 ZOEY/IZZIE/LOGAN 50  Yes! / Direct hit! / Boo-yah!  OFF our heroes celebrating this success, we CUT TO:  ON Z Blob moving one of the wall’s crystal tiles back and  forth.  As the light streaming through the windows hits the tile, it  reflects into Mateo’s eyes. He looks up, intrigued, but his  attention is drawn by a frustrated SIGH from Cooper.  What do you do when you’re building  something and the instructions are  Mr. Oz looks like he’s going to argue but Teo interjects.  Cooper suddenly straightens, struck by a thought.  Oz, Teo and Z Blob exchange a confused glance as Cooper bends  down to examine the floor. He searches around until...  LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 8.  Cooper picks up Luna’s Hourglass and holds it above a TILE  decorated with the same designs: FULL MOON, SUN, CRESCENT  MOON, etc. He presses down on the middle of the tile and --  THWUNK! The tile FLIPS OVER to reveal... a beautiful, crystal  PEDESTAL! Oz and Teo let out a startled GASP as Cooper picks  slots Luna’s Hourglass into an HOURGLASS shaped INDENTATION  on the pedestal. Nothing happens.  Mateo looks thoughtfully from the light pouring through the  windows to the Hourglass atop the pedestal and back.  the light from the stained-glass  windows through the Hourglass?  Z Blob races over to move the tile he was playing with  earlier back and forth. As it moves, it reflects the light  shining through the stained-glass windows in different  directions. (Think bouncing light off reflective shields to  light the tomb in The Mummy). Cooper grins.  Coop and Mateo high-five; it feels like old times. 66 MR. OZ 66  Excellent thinking, you two! Let’s  get these tiles into position.  Mateo, Z Blob, Cooper, and Oz race around positioning the  crystal tiles so that the light flowing through the FIRST  STAINED-GLASS WINDOW bounces off different tiles until... it  pierces Luna’s Hourglass! Suddenly...  WHOOSH! A translucent PEGASUS materializes and gallops  straight for Cooper! He flinches, frozen in place and WHOOSH!  The Pegasus passes right through him!  It’s a hologram.  (Note: The sunlight streaming through the stained-glass  windows is reflected off the crystal tiles and through the  Hourglass thus creating a HOLOGRAM style projection that  could look real or have a sepia tone to give it an aged feel.  As the hologram plays, Oz, Mateo, and Cooper will  narrate/connect the dots for our audience.)  Oz, Mateo, Z Blob, and Cooper watch transfixed as a  translucent LUNA materializes. She looks lonely. 68 MR. OZ 68  Luna... She looks so lonely.  In the hologram, Luna dreamcrafts MIGO. She envelopes the  sweet DREAM CREATURE in a hug. Together, Luna and Migo are  happy. They play on the swings, they visit Dream Realms, they  read, they share an ICE CREAM SUNDAE.  I’m glad she dreamcrafted Migo.  Mateo smiles down at Z Blob –- the parallels between the two  relationships apparent.  I wonder why Luna included this...  As if in answer to his question, Oz, Mateo, Z Blob, and  Cooper are suddenly surprised to see Migo gesticulate angrily  at Luna when she tries to leave him. He wants her to stay.  Why’s he so upset?  In the hologram, Luna tries to placate Migo but he’s  inconsolable. Her face fills with regret.  Luna hugs Migo goodbye and he immediately throws a tantrum,  screaming and pounding the floor. 73 MR. OZ 73  I think Migo grew resentful of  Luna’s responsibilities as Dream  Keeper and her ability to go to the  she had to leave for a little bit.  The hologram changes again -- this time, Migo waits until  Luna falls asleep. Then he picks up her Hourglass and tries  to dreamcraft... but nothing happens.  In the hologram, Migo is frustrated by his inability to  dreamcraft. He throws plates and cups at the wall, SMASHING  them. He ROARS, enraged!  Z Blob grabs Mateo’s hand as if to say –- that wouldn’t  happen to us.  In the hologram, Luna catches Migo YELLING at Dreamlings,  scaring them. Luna scolds Migo and he sulks petulantly. 76 MR. OZ 76  His frustrations and fears are  corrupting him.  DARK SMOKE swirls within the hologram, making it feel ominous  and unsettling. When the smoke clears, Luna turns fitfully in  her sleep. Oz, Mateo, Z Blob and Cooper watch horrified as  Migo invades Luna’s dream as a nightmare! 77 MR. OZ (CONT'D) 77  W-w-whaa--  Luna wakes up, frightened to see Migo elongate and transform  into... the Nightmare King!  Oz, Mateo, Z Blob, and Cooper gasp, thunderstruck.  The Nightmare King, his eyes narrowed in anger at the steady  beam of light holding the Nightmare Storm at bay. The Night  Hunter lowers his CROSSBOW, approaches warily.  light cannon is just too strong.  The Nightmare King strides to the bow of the ship and  WHISTLES LOUDLY. A beat. And then...  TWO NIGHT TERRORS fly out of the fog to hover by the ship.  Destroy the cannon, my lovelies.  The Night Terrors SHRIEK with glee and disappear into the  billowing clouds of the Nightmare Storm.  ON Zoey, peering intently at the Nightmare Storm. She spots  movement in the clouds and then... two Night Terrors burst  forth with a SHRIEK! Homing in on the Light Cannon!  Night Terrors headed this way!  Zoey hops astride Zian and takes to the skies. Phil leaps up  to join her.  I’ll take the ugly one.  Zoey shakes her head and flies off to engage one Night  Terror, drawing it away from the rampart.  Phil heads for the other Night Terror. He SNAPS his tail and  fires a light beam but the Night Terror swoops past him,  making a beeline for the cannon! Logan spots it.  The Night Terror reaches out its claws for the cannon...  Logan POPS into LO-LO and leaps forward to grab the Night  Terror by the tail! The Night Terror roars and shakes Lo-Lo  off... sends him skidding across the rampart. The Night  Terror advances on Lo-Lo, teeth snapping.  WHIP to Izzie, pissed.  She HURLS her HAMMER at the Night Terror and... WHOMP! It  SLAMS into it, knocking the beast off the rampart as the  hammer returns to Izzie’s hand of its own accord (think  Thor’s hammer in Avengers). Albert and Lo-Lo gape.  As Albert helps Lo-Lo to his feet, the Night Terror returns  with a SHRIEK!  Lo-Lo grins.  OFF our heroes protecting the cannon, CUT TO...

They rotate all the tiles to beam the light streaming from  the second window through the Hourglass. And then...  WHOOSH! A hologram of Luna and Migo, looking determined,  appears. Oz, Mateo, Z Blob and Cooper watch as Luna patiently  tries teaching Migo how to dreamcraft. But each time he  fails, he gets angrier.  Luna encourages Migo to keep trying but he SNARLS at her and  stalks off. Luna bows her head, despondent. 96 MR. OZ 96  What Migo failed to grasp is  one expect to create something new.  The hologram changes to reveal the Nightmare King siphoning  imagination from a group of unaware dreamers! He uses this  dark dream energy to dreamcraft a NIGHTLING!  The hologram shifts again. Astride her Pegasus, Luna watches  on horrified as the Nightmare King and his Dark Army corrupt  an entire realm! 98 MR. OZ 98  This must be the moment Luna  decided she had to imprison him.  As the hologram ends, Coop turns to the others, excited. 99 COOPER 99  The third window should tell us how  Luna defeated the Nightmare King!  Mateo hugs Z Blob and whips out the DREAMIE-SCREAMIES (Dream  World Walkie-Talkies).  ON Zoey atop Zian, staying one step ahead of a Night Terror.  She hears the SQUAWK of her Dreamie-Screamie and picks up. 101 ZOEY 101  Kinda busy here, Teo.  In the BG, Izzie, Lo-Lo, and Phil are still wrangling with  the other Night Terror as Albert guards the cannon.  We’re almost done! The last stained-  glass window holds the key to  defeating the Nightmare King!  Zoey ends the transmission and tucks the Dreamie-Screamie  away. Eyeing the beam of light shooting from the cannon, Zoey  gets an idea. She whispers something to Zian, who nods and  dives for the beam.  Zian slows down, allowing the Night Terror to gain on them.  It’s almost on top of them when...  NOW!  Zoey agiley flips OVER THE BEAM as Zian FLIES UNDER IT! The  Night Terror tries to change course, but can’t! It careens  into the light beam and dissolves into DREAM ETHER! Zoey  lands back on Zian with a grim smile.  ANGLE ON Izzie hurling her hammer at the other Night Terror.  The hammer THWICKS through the air.  But the Night Terror zips out of the way and the hammer  accidentally SLAMS into Lo-Lo! Oof! He’s knocked off his feet  as Izzie winces.  Lo-Lo dizzily stands.  Just then, BOOSH! The Night Terror swoops in, knocking  Izzie’s hammer away! Uh-oh! It advances on Izzie, snarling.  Albert and Logan race for her but are too far away...  RAAGH! With a roar, Phil shoots a light beam at the Night  Terror and SHUNK! The Night Terror turns to crystal! 111 ALBERT 111  Phil flashes Albert a thumbs-up as Izzie holds up her hand a  la Thor waiting for his hammer.  Her hammer WHOOSHES back into Izzie’s hand. She grins and  whips it around to SMASH the Night Terror into DREAM ETHER!  Logan, Izzie, Albert and Phil WHOOP with delight as Zoey and  Zian alight atop the rampart alongside them, victorious.  SMASH TO:  The Nightmare King, HOWLING. He angrily FIRES a SHADOW BOLT  from his staff, forcing Susan, Snivel and Sneak to dive for  cover. The Night Hunter grimaces.  I won’t be thwarted by an old man,  a monkey, and a couple of children.  LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 16.  The Nightmare King composes himself. Sneers.  these Dreamchasers myself.  The Nightmare King leaps astride his NIGHT MARE, who takes to  the skies. As they fly off, he calls over his shoulder:  Prepare to attack!  The Night Hunter slumps, a little crestfallen. Catches Susan,  Sneak, and Snivel looking at him and lashes out.  As the Nightlings jump and scurry into position, CUT TO:  Our team is in a celebratory mood. But then, Albert catches  sight of something zoom out of the stormclouds... he squints.  Our team whips around to see... the Nightmare King on his  Night Mare! BOOSH! He fires a barrage of SHADOW BOLTS,  forcing our heroes to scramble and dive for cover. And  then...  FATHWOOM! A SHADOW BOLT SMASHES into the light cannon,  obliterating it! As debris rains down, the beam of light  sputters out and our team stares in horror at...  The Sharkyface ship, appearing out of the Nightmare Storm!  OFF our heroes facing the approaching onslaught, CUT TO:  The light from the final hologram flickers over Oz, Mateo, Z  Blob, and Cooper.  They watch reverently as Luna materializes at a desk,  surrounded by crumpled papers covered in calculations. She  looks frazzled and frightened.  She’s so scared. 120 MR.

OZ (CONT'D) 121  Deep down, she still felt like he  was her dear friend.  The hologram changes and we see Luna meet up with three  figures, partially hidden by shadows. All three hold  HOURGLASSES by their sides.  A loud BOOM within the hologram makes our team jump. Luna and  the Dreamchasers looks over their shoulders, fearful.  Mateo clutches Z Blob’s hand... the moment of truth...  Luna steps alongside the three DREAMCHASERS. As they hold  aloft their HOURGLASSES, ready to face down the Nightmare  King, reveal... one of the Dreamchasers is Oz!  Mateo, Z Blob, and Cooper look over at Oz, shocked. They are  so focused they don’t see...  The Nightmare King surreptitiously sneak into the room! He  stops in his tracks, shocked by the sight of Luna. Thinking  for a second that she’s real, he reaches out his hand...  LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 18.  As his hand PASSES THROUGH the hologram, he lets out a  frustrated GROWL that draws our team’s attention. Startled,  Cooper bumps into one of the crystal tiles, halting the  hologram. Mateo stares at the Nightmare King, aghast.  He whips his staff around...  BAWOOSH! He fires a DREAMBOLT at the last stained-glass  window, which EXPLODES and shatters against the floor! Before  anyone can react, the Nightmare King swings his staff around  and knocks Cooper off his feet.  Oz fires his TELESCOPE RIFLE but the Nightmare King dodges –-  faster than the eye can see.

Zoey clocks the crossbow bolt streaking towards  him... no escape... she yanks Zian around... WINDS HER  CLOCK...  THUD! The Night Hunter stares in confusion at the crossbow  bolt stuck in the side of the castle and Albert cradled  unharmed in Zian’s paws! Off Albert’s relief, CUT TO:  Sir Z keeps blocking the Nightmare King’s SHADOWBOLTS, but is  obviously tiring. Mateo and Cooper dreamcraft ARROWS. FFWIIP!  FFWIIP! The Nightmare King has no trouble FLICKING them away!  ANGLE ON Oz. He’s got a bead on the NK. Fires his rifle...  CLICK! He’s all out of ammunition!  Seeing that Oz is momentarily distracted, the Nightmare King  spins his staff around... WHACK! Oz falls to the floor,  knocked out! ON Cooper, noticing his sand is running low.  We’re almost out of dream sand!  The Nightmare King BLASTS Sir Z with a SHADOWBOLT that drives  him to his knees. Worried, Mateo races to Z’s side...  brandishes his Hourglass.  The Nightmare King CACKLES and SHOOTS out a swirl of PURPLE  AND BLACK DREAM ETHER that snakes around Cooper and Mateo,  immobilizing them! They grunt, trying to break free.  The Nightmare King BLASTS Sir Z again and again... leaving  plain ol’ regular sized Z Blob, woozy and shaky.  Migo, please...  The NK approaches Mateo, reaches out, menacingly...

Z’s eyes widen as he’s whisked out of the Castle! Desperate,  Mateo fights free of the inky, black dream ether restraining  him and yanks Cooper free. They rush to Oz’s side...  I’ve got him! GO!!  As Mateo races away, Coop helps a woozy Oz to his feet. He  throws Oz’s arm over his shoulder.  Cooper! We need to get Luna’s  Hourglass and get out of here!  They turn towards the Hourglass but then... BOOM! A section  of wall SHATTERS, sending crystal shards raining down! Coop  yanks Oz out of harm’s way but the Hourglass is buried in the  rubble.  They stumble for the door as we CUT TO:  Mateo dodging falling shards of crystal as he zig-zags after  the Nightmare King... BOOM! BOOM!
