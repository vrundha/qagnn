 Ep. 105: "THE HOURGLASS"  Open on a long row of hurdles. *  Coop sprints and leaps over each one, another, another, *  Finally crosses the finish line. He breathes heavily, checks *  his wristwatch with a frustrated look. *  Izzie yells from back AT THE STARTING LINE where Mateo and *  Logan are waiting as well. *  Izzie crouches in the blocks, then OFF SHE GOES! *  She runs and jumps, run and jumps.  She knocks over one hurdle that clatters to the ground,  but makes it across the finish line.  Logan crouches at the starting line and then, ZOOM! *  He shoots off the blocks and sprints down the track. *  He effortlessly flies over one hurdle, and another, and *  Coop eyes the stopwatch on his wristwatch. The numbers tick *  by until Logan finally zips across the finish line. *  Coop stops the timer. *  BACK AT THE START, Mateo wobbles on the starting blocks, *  unsteady. He gets ready. *  He looks over and sees zBlob holding a little pennant rooting *  Mateo squints his eyes at the course, lowers his head. *  He raises up, and dashes off of the starting blocks. He’s *  racing towards the hurdle. A look of determination in his *  face. *  He gets closer, closer, makes a leap and--- *  TRIPS INTO THE HURDLE, it sends him TUMBLING END OVER END *  LIKE A TUMBLEWEED, he slams into the next hurdle and gets *  tangled in that one too, tumbles into another, then another, *  finally landing with an ungraceful PLOP in a big pile of *  twisted metal. *  The gang walks up. Mateo's voice emerges from the pile.  Coop reaches into the mess and helps Mateo out. *  THAT WAS BETTER? How could he have *  Last time he got his shoelaces *  Logan grabs his backpack, heading out past the bleachers. *  He strolls off the track, leaving the three of them to look *  at each other. *  Mateo is getting into bed. zBlob is curled up beside him. *  Izzie watches him from bed where she’s reading. *  He looks down, notices that he is in fact squeezing the  pillow. He throws it across the room and rolls over.  totally happy that he’s better than *  She holds out her little stuffed animal of an anime bunny. *  Izzie turns off the overhead light, setting down a manga she *  was reading. We catch sight of a particularly COOL COSTUME ON *  THE COVER. She drifts off to sleep, her stuffed bunny held in *  her arms. *  Mateo's still awake, fuming. He stares at his ceiling, *  grumbling to himself. He instinctually grabs zBlob and starts *  stress-squeezing him instead of the pillow. *  Mateo opens his eyes to see IZZIE in a wild costume that’s *  similar to the one she went to sleep looking at. *  Mateo looks at his hourglass. Closes his eyes. Concentrates. *  A glowing sand swirls from his hourglass and circles around *  him. It transforms him until finally we see. MATEO'S DREAM *  AVATAR. *  Coop and Logan walk up. *  Coop closes his eyes, concentrates. And just like Mateo did, *  the sand glows and drifts out of his hourglass, swirling *  around him until he’s transformed into his DREAM AVATAR. *  Logan pouts. *  She starts twirling her hourglass. Oz stops her. *  Music swells over an aerial shot circling a fantasyland *  mountain. Towering, covered in pillowy whimsical piles of *  snow on the top. *  Oz’s spaceship cruises by the vista. The kids faces are *  pressed against the port holes, looking out the windows. We *  move past them one by one, taking in their reactions, finally *  stopping on the last porthole where we see zBlob’s face *  FLATTENED ENTIRELY AGAINST THE GLASS. * 34 OZ (PRE-LAP) 34 *  Welcome, Dreamchasers to PILLOW *  The ship finally touches down at the foot of the mountain. *  They all emerge from the hatch. *  Oz holds up the hourglass. Studies the cracks.  You sure we need to fix this at  rucksack.  Oz walks over to A COMICLY OVERSIZED BACKPACK FILLED WITH ALL  SORTS OF HIKING GEAR.  Oz can’t find anywhere to put it.  Mateo tucks it in his backpack. Oz slips his arms into the *  straps on his.  He GRUNTS AS HE tries to step forward but his backpack won’t  budge.  The chimp rolls his eyes.  The group is trudging up the mountain. Oz lags behind the  kids, struggling with his massive backpack.  Logan snatches the backpack off Mateo's shoulders. *  Oz loses his balance, falls over under the weight of his *  enormous backpack. *  Logan sprints ahead. Taking a clear lead. Izzie jumps up the *  She makes one last jump, but loses her footing on the rock, *  tumbling to the ground. *  She pulls her stuffed toy, Bunzai bunny, out. Focuses her *  hourglass on the small plushie and in a whirl of dreamsand, *  BUNZAI BUNNY COMES TO LIFE. An enormous, twelve foot anime *  character made real! *  Oz is still toppled over, strapped into his enormous  backpack, unable to see what’s happening, *  Is someone up there wasting dream *  sand? It sounds like someone’s *  AHEAD WITH LOGAN *  He’s grinning to himself, thinking he’s got this in the bag  when BUNZAI BUNNY HOPS UP ALONGSIDE HIM, with Izzie riding on *  her back.  Bunzai abruptly veers off in the wrong direction. *  Bunzai leads Izzie off on a wild zig zag path up the  mountain.  Logan keeps running on foot, a second later, A PRIMITIVE  TRUCK RACES UP ALONGSIDE HIM, with Coop at the wheel. *  As Teo’s truck races head, Logan looks up to see  ZBLOB HAS TURNED INTO A BALLOON and is carrying Mateo through *  the air, up the mountain.  Logan tries to run even faster. He TRIPS on a rock and falls  face first. Mateo's backpack, which he has been carrying,  falls open and LUNA’S HOURGLASS ROLLS ON THE GROUND.  Logan looks at the hourglass on the ground before him. *  He looks ahead at his three friends heading up the mountain. *  He GRABS THE HOURGLASS. Closes his eyes and attempts to  dreamcraft with it.  THE HOURGLASS GLOWS and TREMBLES in his hands. The cracks in  the glass sizzle with electricity and suddenly A SHOCKWAVE OF  DREAM ENERGY SHOOTS OUT FROM IT, SENDING LOGAN TUMBLING.  FARTHER UP THE MOUNTAIN, the shockwave hits Coop, Izzie, and *  Mateo and sends them all flying. *  Teo’s truck crashes into a tree, turns back into his toy car.  Izzie falls off Bunzai, who morphs back into a stuffed  animal.  And Mateo and zBlob crash land. *  Logan comes running past.  He cackles in pride as he bounds up the mountain ahead of *  them. *  Snivel, Sneak, and Susan are carrying a large glass jar that  swirls with dark dream energy. Snivel and Susan struggle to  lift the jar up to Sneak who is flying above them, guiding it *  onto a shelf holding other jars of energy.  Suddenly, THAT SAME SHOCKWAVE HITS THEM.  It sends the darklings tumbling comically. Sneak’s wings  struggle to hold the jar in the air by himself, but it slips  from his grasp. It plummets for the ground, about to break  when THE NIGHTMARE KING GRABS IT. He slowly puts it back on  the shelf. The darklings cower under his cold withering  stare.  The Dark Archer runs in.  It’s Luna.  Luna? That’s impossible. Luna’s  The weight of that threat hangs in the air until it’s  interrupted by Snivel absentmindedly scratching his back on  the shelf, and causing that same jar of dream energy to fall  off and shatter on the ground.  The dream energy squirms on the ground like it’s alive, like  a snake that’s snuck out of its cage, before it disappears  into a crack.  The darklings look at their boss sheepishly. The Nightmare  king rolls his eyes.  Coop, Mateo, Izzie, and zBlob climb over the last cliff, *  emerging on the top of the mountain.  ESTABLISH the majestic top of Pillow Peak.  They see Logan running towards them.  And that’s when they see it, he’s not running, HE’S BEING  CHASED BY A GIANT FURRY YETI.  Mateo, Coop, Logan, and zBlob all run for their lives across *  the mountaintop.  The Yeti stomps after them, his massive feet pounding through *  the snow and rock.  Mateo, Coop, Logan, and zBlob duck inside a cave, hiding. *  Did you see the size of that thing?  ZBlob is tugging on Mateo's arm. *  ZBlob keeps tugging at his arm.  They realize Izzie’s not here.  Mateo thinks, then nods and starts heading for the cave *  entrance. 85 LOGAN 85  Coop steps up beside him.

It’s filled *  with BEAUTIFUL ORNATE CARVINGS ON THE WALLS. *  Yeti hands Mateo a STRANGE NAUTILUS SHELL. It’s covered in *  glowing dots and marks.  Coop inspects the strange shell. *  The yeti looks at him like he’s crazy.  The Dark Archer peeks inside the cave where he sees the faint  shadows of our heroes in the back. He creeps inside,  motioning to the darklings who tiptoe past their boss,  heading for the kids. They inch closer and closer and finally  THEY LEAP. But the darklings just get AN ARMFUL OF SNOW!  THE KIDS MADE ‘SNOWMEN’ COPIES OF THEMSELVES to lure them in.  Snivel, Susan, and Sneak look at each other confused.  IS  He looks back at the entrance of the cave to see Mateo *  looking in.  Nearby, the YETI unleashes a WILD YODEL. It shakes the whole  mountain and brings down an avalanche of snow.

But as they are, A GIANT SNOWBALL ROLLS INCHES AWAY FROM  MORE GIANT SNOWBALLS ROLL DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN, WHIPPING *  PAST THEM RIGHT AND LEFT. This avalanche is still going on! *  THE KIDS RUN DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.

The Dark Archer flies out of the cave, DREAMCRAFTS A  SNOWBOARD MID AIR, and lands on it, deftly carving his way  down the mountain after the kids.  EVERYONE IS RUNNING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN. A giant *  snowboulder smashes against a tree near Logan. He has to make *  a giant LEAP to avoid getting knocked over. *  And the Dark Archer is right on their heels, carving on his *  snowboard back and forth, dodging rocks and snowboulders *  alike. *  Mateo is racing down as fast as he can. He looks ahead and *  sees a tree branch right in his path. It looks just like... A *  TRACK HURDLE. Oh no. *  QUICK FLASHBACK: Mateo approaching a waking world track *  hurdle. *  He leaps, stretches up over the bent tree but then... TRIPS. *  He tumbles to the ground and THE NAUTILUS SHELL FLIES OUT OF *  HIS HAND! *  It soars through the air in slow motion before finally *  landing in the hand of... THE DARK ARCHER! *  He holds up his prize triumphantly. *  The kids all skid to a stop, looking back at him. They’re *  sunk without that shell! *  PLOP! His evil monologue gets ungracefully interrupted when A *  GIANT SNOWBALL LANDS ON TOP OF HIM, ROLLING HIM UP AND *  SENDING HIM SMASHING INTO A TREE.  The nautilus once again goes flying in the air.  Logan runs one direction. *  Coop runs another. *  With their eyes on the ‘pop fly,’ they both accidentally *  crash into one another.

But they’re not *  out of the woods yet. *  THE DARKLINGS ON SHARKFACE ROAR OFF A CLIFF AND BARREL DOWN *  THE MOUNTAIN AFTER THEM! *  They zero in on Izzie, closing the distance. *  Susan runs off the hood and makes a massive ‘Mad Max style’  leap through the air, landing on Izzi’s back, sending them *  tumbling to the ground.  Susan looms over Izzie, snarling viciously. Just when we *  think Izzie’s totally done for, THE DARKLING IS YANKED OFF of *  her by the YETI! *  But the reunion is short lived. A DARK ARROW PIERCES THE *  YETI’S FUR. He howls in pain as a dark shadow spreads from  the wound across his body.  FARTHER UP THE MOUNTAIN, we see the Dark Archer lower his  crossbow with satisfaction.

Just then, Mateo runs past.  Then Logan and Coop race past. *  Oz scratches his chin, looks uphill to find Izzie and Zblob *  racing right at them, A GIANT SNOWBALL RIGHT BEHIND THEM.
