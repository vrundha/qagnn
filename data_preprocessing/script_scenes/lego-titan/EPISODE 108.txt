In a hall with sheep, Logan and Coop pass a class where JADYN  gives a talk in his underwear! Logan SHIELDS HIS EYES.  Coop goes there. Logan spots Lance slip a note in his locker!  As soon as Teo and Z Blob step inside, Teo backtracks. 130 I don’t even think Zoey’s here... 130  This feels wrong. Let’s just go.  But it’s too late! THWAP! Teo gets ensnared and LIFTED into  the air by a boobie-trap that leaves him DANGLING!

Logan hurries off to Lance’s ire. Lance’s eyes light up.  Coop enters the empty room that resembles Ms. Putnam’s class.  He spots MANY WRAPPED CANDIES on her desk. He eats some! Yum!  Whatever Z Blob does to disengage Teo tightens the trap more!  Just then Zoey arrives on ZION. She instantly feels betrayed.  WHAM! Zoey POUNDS the wall, mad! She sets her head there.  He’s never seen her like this! He’s at a loss for what to do.  The Locator PINGS! Izzie and Bunzai watch nearby as a TINY  HANDED PIGEON throws BREADCRUMBS to adults, including Ms.  Ramos!

But  Ms. Ramos still twists her head, trying!  Ms. Ramos GASPS! She suddenly stops contorting her head!  Logan discovers Coop ate all the candy on Ms. Putnam’s desk!  Coop’s mouth is still full of several pieces!  Just then, Ms. Putnam enters, headed for her desk! Coop’s  eyes widen! (NOTE: Ms. Putnam is wordless in dream.)  Ms. Putnam reaches for the candy on her desk, but finds only  empty wrappers instead! Her face turns RED again!  Ms. Putnam looks like she’s ready to explode! The duo slowly  back away as she starts to GROW TALLER AND LARGER!  Coop and Logan race past her out of the room!  Trapped Teo’s in pain but he just wants Zoey to feel better.

Ms. Putnam sees the zeppelin and stops. The kids think they  got through to her. But as the zeppelin spins around, they  see what Teo wrote (NO TEXT ONSCREEN but we see the SMILEY-  FACE EMOJI AT THE END of the message). 197 Bro, you used an emoji? Seriously? 197 198 It’s the universal language! 198  Ms. Putnam REDDENS again! Then FWOOSH! She SWATS the zeppelin  away! Then GRABS it! PWSSS! Z Blob shrinks back to normal.

The ground shakes! 207 I told you: See the bigger picture. 207  BRRRRRR! A massive BEANSTALK SPROUTS into the sky! Taking the  kids with it! They hang on for dear life as they watch the  ground quickly descend beneath them - giant candy left below.  Bunzai SLIDES DOWN. The boys try to wave to Ms. Putnam. 212 Ms. Putnam! Hey, Ms. Putnam! 212  But Ms. Putnam’s too busy destroying the city! Bunzai CLIMBS  up the stalk, lugging the giant candy BETWEEN ITS TEETH!  Ms. Putnam sees the beanstalk and heads straight for it!  Bunzai launches the candy at Ms. Putnam, just as she swings  for the stalk, making contact with both it and the candy in  the same swipe! The stalk TEETERS and cascades down!  Ms. Putnam studies the giant candy curiously. When she SNIFFS  it, her eyes WIDEN with delight! She munches on the giant  candy, which finally soothes the savage beast.  The kids cheer! Just then, PWSSSS! Ms. Putnam SHRINKS to  normal size, still munching the candy, which didn’t shrink!  But she can still HOLD it with her two normal-sized hands!  Teo awakens groggily in bed. He looks over to find Izzie  dressed in workout attire for Sheep Week and stretching. 217 Izzie, my everything hurts. 217  Jay holds bag lunches for a pleased Izzie and closed-off Teo.  Izzie grabs her bag and peeks inside. Teo ignores his.  Teo doesn’t respond. He just heads for the door.  Izzie’s STUNNED into silence.  Izzie feels beyond awful! She just made three big mistakes  that may have just cost Jay his chance at happiness!  She guiltily plods over to Teo by the front door.  Teo turns to Jay and sees how hard Jay’s trying to keep his  spirits up. Teo runs to get his lunch then the two kids exit.  Zoey is the last kid to enter. She gives Teo an annoyed  glance. But hey, that’s way more than he’s gotten before!  Ms. Putnam enters her classroom, HAPPY! Like a new person!  Teo, Coop and Logan beam at one other.  The boys’ faces fall. Coop pulls a candy from his pocket. Ms.  Putnam STROLLS over and SNATCHES it, much to the boys’ shock! 235 Oh, how I have missed you! 235  She returns to her desk and EATS it triumphantly.

First teams, line up!  Izzie, Coop and Logan try to lure a glum Teo off the bench.  Teo stays seated, head in his hands. Izzie stretches by him.  Pink Rev. (04/30/21) 26.  Frustrated, Coop and Logan do as she says.  He shrugs. Coop glances at them, seriously starting to panic.  Teo JUMPS OFF the bench like it’s on fire!  I know, which is why you’re going  to stretch and make Coop smile.  Teo mimics her stretch as first teams play. Coop’s pleased.  He nods. She spots Nova with the Nightmare Club all in black.  Club’s team now. Those big turkeys!  Coop and Logan wave Teo and Izzie over. The four head to a  tetherball court where Coach Jeffreys is waiting.  The foursome glance at the LEMMINGS: Four SPECTACLED SHORT  BOYS who each remove their glasses and hand them off to one  another. They all sound super NASALLY.  This is going to be too easy! Coop SIGHS, finally relaxing.  Coach Jeffreys commands the field, megaphone to his mouth.  Teo, Izzie, Coop and Logan are set to play against a HOWLING  team of Dallas, Jake, Jadyn, and 2 JOCKS. All take the field.  Coop-- No, let’s just do this.  Right then from across the field, a heinous <CRY> rings out!  COACH JEFFREYS BLOWS a whistles then returns to the field.  Pink Rev.

Logan nods, thinking about his plan to take the hourglass.  Lugging his backpack, Logan strolls past a field of sheep who  suck at tetherball, until he gets UNDER THE BLEACHERS. Logan  removes the CRACKED HOURGLASS from his backpack and hands it  to Lance, who’s there waiting!
