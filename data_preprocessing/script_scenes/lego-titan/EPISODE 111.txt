 The Dream Chasers are called to action when the students  of their school are plagued with nightmares. But with  their dream gate mysteriously blocked, they may never get  to the dream world in time. It’s up to the unlikely  pairing of Zoey, Albert, and zBlob to see what’s blocking  the way.  Peter Sattler  Jadyn runs and jumps across a video game level. He dodges *  ENEMY FIRE. Tiptoes across tiny hovering platforms -- *  Does a flip, lands on a spring pad which LAUNCHES HIM INTO *  THE AIR.  BOOSTER ROCKETS appear out of his back and he ZOOMS through *  the air, soaring. *  He shoots through a ring of stars and grabs a glowing ORB. He *  slowly descends to the ground as VICTORY MUSIC SWELLS! *  Jadyn looks at his trophy with a satisfied look, but then he *  notices a crude wooden sign, inartfully stuck in the ground.  It stands in weird contrast to the slick digital realm. Jadyn *  looks at the HANDPAINTED YELLOW EYE SIGIL scrawled on it.  2 JADYN (CONT’D) 2 *  He looks over at an equally out of place door.  Jadyn emerges through the door to find himself in a poorly *  constructed ‘carnival game.’ Crude targets of Mateo, Izzie, *  and the others are moving back and forth at the end of a  booth, like a target shooting game. Jadyn raises a skeptical *  eyebrow.  He picks up one of the balls and tosses it at the targets. We  follow the path of the ball behind the counter where it bonks  onto the head of A NIGHTLING. They’re the ones carrying the *  signs back and forth, hidden from the player. The nightling *  growls, rubs its head. Another nightling barks at it to keep *  moving his target.  He turns to leave, reaches for the doorknob when the entire  door he came through disappears into a smoky mist.  The shadows of the nightlings marching back and forth grow to *  exaggerated, nightmarish size on the wall as the carnival  music takes a dissonant scary turn.  Jadyn quivers in his boots. Runs for it but finds himself -- *  A carnival-style hall of mirrors. He keeps bumping into a *  reflection of himself. Trapped. But then, ONE OF THE MIRRORS *  FILLS WITH THAT GLOWING YELLOW SIGIL OF THE NIGHTMARE KING.  5 NIGHTMARE KING 5  Jadyn shivers as the yellow eye gets larger and larger and *  finally, it blinks shut. A quiet beat. When it reopens, it’s  on EVERY MIRROR ALL AROUND HIM, LIKE A KALEIDESCOPE.  6 NIGHTMARE KING (CONT’D) 6  JADYN SCREAMS! *  Jadyn suddenly finds himself in his school desk, having just *  woken from his dream. He pants heavily, looks over at the  class who is staring at him. *  Jadyn, I know root fungus IS a *  serious threat to cork tree  Mateo, Logan, and Cooper are filing out when Jadyn pushes *  past them, grumpy, frazzled, totally out of it.  9 MATEO 9  What’s gotten into him?

She nurses her face from the *  impact. *  Logan sits by the tree, nursing his face. Behind him, Cooper *  has dreamcrafted a drone and tries to fly out only to hit the *  forcefield repeatedly. *  Jadyn wakes up inside a GRIMHOLD CAGE. As he looks around  confused, he sees nightlings prodding other DREAMERS into  cages and marching them out in a procession.

Coach Jeffreys is on stage, addressing the student body. *  He drones on with the details as Mateo and his friends  whisper to one another.  We have to tell him our dreams?  something up. It’ll be fine.  A montage of students. Each one sitting alone in front of  Coach Jeffreys at his desk, who is scribbling notes and  consulting a stack of books next to him.

Okay, got your order. Two steak  She looks up from her ticket to see Mateo, Izzie, Cooper, *  Logan, Z Blob and Mr. Oz all staring at her with suspicious *  smiles.  Tip first, then we talk.

IS Z BLOB THERE? IS HE OK? OVER! *  CAN YOU HEAR ME? OVER! *  Zoey and her troupe finally make their way to the other side  of the dream gate.  What took you so long? *  Cooper peers into the dream gate which only reveals vague  shadows through its swirling portal.  Zoey looks closer, sure enough, there’s a STRANGE DEVICE  attached to the side of the gateway. It’s projecting some  kind of forcefield.  She gets to work trying to pry it off when an arrow THWOKS  into the ground beside her. She spins to see: *  THEY’RE UNDER ATTACK! At the top of a hill the Night Hunter *  rears back on the Night Mare. Behind him, an army of *  nightlings pour over the crest and swarm the dream gate! *  Another arrow flies at them, and lands with a THUD beside Z *  Blob. He stares at it unfazed. *  Keep working on that device. Z *  hold them off.

Albert pulls him back like a giant  slingshot and then lets him go.  Z Blob flies through the air and BARRELS INTO A GROUP OF *  NIGHTLINGS like a bowling ball taking down pins. *  We follow an arrow as it leaves a nightling’s bow on the *  front lines, soars across the forest, it’s about to hit Zoey  when, THWACK.

He scoops her up in one tackle, *  and they FLY THROUGH THE DREAM BRIDGE GATE, which closes  behind her.  The Dark Archer leaps off his horse, tries to open it, but it *  won’t budge. He looks back to see his nightlings capturing *  Albert in the distance. A small victory, but one he’ll take.  Z Blob wraps up Mateo in a huge hug. Logan congratulates *  Zoey.
