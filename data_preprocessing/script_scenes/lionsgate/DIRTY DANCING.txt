 Mikki Daughtry & Tobias Iaconis Based on characters created by Eleanor Bergstein CITY LIGHTS shine. The TWIN TOWERS stand tall. TRAFFIC jams the streets. The night’s hot. Steam rises. Sweat drips as PEOPLE jostle for space on crowded sidewalks. Cabbies shout at pedestrians. MUSIC mingles with CAR HORNS... ...as BUSKERS lay down a boiling beat. The cadence echoes off the brick walls as a TRAIN pulls in, lending its squeaky clickety-clack sound to the underground tunes. Some TEENS dance to the pulse of the music, heated young bodies riding the rhythm. A few HOT GIRLS breeze through the platform. One drops a few bills into the busker’s basket. They head toward the train... ...and walk right past a YOUNG COUPLE leaning against a post. The guy whispers into his girlfriend’s ear. She grins, pulls his face to hers. As they make out... ...the TRAIN DOORS open. The Hot Girls hop on. Just before the doors close, the Make-Out-Couple dart inside. The Guy grabs an overhead strap, pulls his Girl close. Next to them: JAKE (19) grips a hand-strap. He’s broody. Scowly. Sexy as hell. He glances down at a SEALED LETTER in his other hand. An expansive ELEGANT HOME is being remodeled. The yard is half-landscaped. A BACKHOE sits near a dirt mound. The area’s littered with BEER CANS, BOTTLES, and Jake’s FRIENDS. One climbs into the backhoe, says: The Backhoe’s engine RUMBLE to life. The BUCKET judders up and down. Jake laughs. Climbs onto the rig. The Drunk Friend hops out. Jake slides into the seat. He yanks at the levers. His feet work the clutch and gas. A puff of DUST rises as the backhoe starts to move. His friends let out a raucous cheer. The backhoe bucket-teeth punch through the dirt. Jake shifts the lever and the bucket rises, dirt falling like snow. A SEXY TEEN steps up to the backhoe. She smiles at Jake.  SEXY TEEN  The pool. A pristine, crystal-blue swimming pool glitters in the moonlight. More cheers. Jake grins. The train STOPS. Make-Out-Girl stumbles, bumps into Jake. Whoops! Her Guy pulls her back to him. The doors OPEN. The Hot Girls eye him. Yummy. Jake grins. Not half bad. The train stops. The Hot Girls get off. One looks back at him. Smiles. Maybe he’ll go talk to her. But... the letter. The doors close. Oh, well. The train LURCHES forward. BLUE LIGHTS strobe on top of a POLICE CRUISER. A few of the friends, the ones who didn’t run, loiter near the backhoe... ...which has been driven through the wall of the house. The cops approach, flashlights shining over the damage. Then the flashlights find Jake, sitting on a mound of dirt. Drinking a beer. Not a care in the world. Jake walks past THE LINCOLN CENTER. A group of DANCERS come out, still in rehearsal gear. They hurry down the stairs. He slows as the dancers dart around him, his eyes on a brightly-lit HIGHRISE up ahead. Imposing. Posh. Jake checks the gilded door numbers. He looks at the envelope. Finally, he gets to: APT 1911. LAUGHTER inside. MUSIC. Jake straightens. KNOCKS. Waits. He’s about to knock again-- the door opens: a WOMAN (50s). Jake doesn’t know her. But we do. It’s LISA HOUSEMAN. He shows her the letter. She stares at it. Then at him. Lisa drags Jake into the room. It’s a SMALL PARTY, in full swing. Well-heeled guests laugh and mingle. Lisa hurries in, pulling Jake behind her. A woman turns. It’s BABY (50s). Time has been good to her. She’s refined. Sleek. She eyes Jake. He looks familiar. Baby’s face lights up. She hurries toward him. Ah, okay. Jake holds up the letter. Baby takes the letter. Grins even wider. The guests are intrigued by this new bit of excitement. They all watch. LOLA (13), Baby’s daughter, joins her mom. She starts to open the envelope. She lifts the flap of the envelope and Jake realizes... Baby stops opening, looks up. Know what? Jake hesitates for a brief moment. Then: DANIEL (50s), Lola’s dad, puts a hand on Baby’s back. Baby steps sharply away from him. Daniel looks to Lisa. Help? Lisa takes center stage, keeping the attention off Baby. Baby gives her a pleading look. Please don’t. So Lisa pivots. Everyone laughs. Everyone except Jake and Baby. He hasn’t taken his eyes off Baby. She looks pretty broken up. Uhhh... Lisa looks to Baby. Baby forces a smile. Jake watches her closely. So does Daniel. She doesn’t cry, but she can’t speak, either. This is news to Jake. The fuck? Baby shakes her head. Trying to process... everything. Lisa still holds court -- but now she’s carried away. The guests hang on her every word: She stands abruptly, a trembling smile pasted to her face. Daniel steps closer to her. Okay. Daniel backs off. Baby goes to Jake. The tears threaten again. Jake looks around at the guests. The mood has gone from jovial to awkward. Baby walks him to the door. She’s still spinning, but she’s got a better handle on it now. Just a little. She glances back at the guests. She watches as he walks toward the elevator. DING. Baby offers goodnights to the guests as they file out. Lisa hugs her tightly. Baby nods. Lisa starts to leave. Turns back. Gives Baby a long look, then kisses her cheek. She leaves. Closes the door behind her. Baby stares at the closed door. Turns. Daniel’s still there. She sighs. Lola joins them. Gives her dad a hip-bump. Lola laughs. Baby pushes him toward the door. She closes the door. Lola’s dying to know: Lola grumbles and trods away, disappears into the hallway. Baby leans against the door. Shit. A BUS speeds down the road, the city lights far behind. Jake sits in the back. Alone. Jake sits on a BENCH inside the police station. A couple his friends share looks of “what-the-fuck-ever” with him as they’re dragged out by their parents. A cop, PETE (50s), talks with MR. WINSTEAD (60s). Polished. Wealthy. Jake’s mom, ANNE (40s), hurries into the station. Tired. Overworked. She glares at Jake. Pete puts a hand on Anne’s arm. Too familiar. Jake bristles. Jake stands. Starts to walk past them but-- Pete backs off. Winstead gives Jake a long, sympathetic look. Jake’s face reddens. He seethes, humiliated. But Jake’s already at the door. She hurries to catch up. Baby looks through a PHOTO ALBUM, the unopened letter beside her. She flips through the album. Stops. Removes a photo. She stares at it. We don’t see the photo - just her face. Baby walks past a mirror and sees YOUNG BABY staring back. Then she’s gone. Baby looks down at the envelope. Opens it. Jake comes in. A POLICE UNIFORM SHIRT is draped over an ironing board. Another shirt hangs nearby. Jake opens a nightstand drawer. Takes out a HOSPITAL WRISTBAND. He runs his thumb over the name: JOHN CASTLE. Baby stares blindly out at the city, the open letter clenched in her hand. Whatever that letter said, it broke her. A sprawling 28-acre indoor sports and entertainment complex on the Hudson River. A LACROSSE game. Lola’s on the field in her GREEN uniform and gear. She scoops the ball from the air. Baby sits with several other LACROSSE MOMS. They each wear an article of clothing in the same green as the girls’ uniforms. Baby’s in a green top. Fitting right in. But distracted. DIANE (50s) nudges her. Baby looks up as Lisa plops down beside her. She jerks her head toward the Lacrosse Moms. Baby eyes them. Baby looks ruefully down at her green shirt. Yes, she is. Baby shakes her head. Force-swallows. She can’t cry here. Lisa grabs her hand. Grips tightly. Baby pulls a photo from her purse. It’s the photo Baby took from the album: Johnny and Baby doing THE LIFT, 1963. Baby stares at her young, idealistic self in the photo. Lisa grabs the photo from Baby. Holds it up to Baby’s face. Lisa scoots closer. Puts an arm around her. Baby stands, finds Lola on the field. Gives her a wave and blows her a kiss. Lola waves back. Baby kisses Lisa. Leaves. Lisa turns to smile at Diane. Jake zips a DUFFLE BAG. He grabs his WALLET and KEYS. Anne’s waiting when Jake comes in, bag over his shoulder. He opens the front door. That stops him. He turns. Anne falters. Last thing she expected him to say. He stares her down. Yes. He did. Pete walks in. Looks like he just woke up. Through the open door, Anne sees a SILVER MERCERDES pull up. Jake walks out, Anne right behind him. She freezes as the car door opens and Baby steps out. Anne stares. Baby stares back. Baby’s car speeds along. For a moment, she thinks he’s not going to answer. Then: Baby glances at him. Jake gives zero fucks about what he did. Jake gives her a long once over. She’s high-class. Luxury car, the CAR PHONE mounted on the console. Rich. They go quiet. It’s kind of awkward. She doesn’t like the sound of that. But she lets it go. Baby’s car drives through a small, idyllic town. They pass a ROAD SIGN: SAUGERTIES, NY. Baby’s car winds up the road to Kellerman’s. In the distance, the resort sprawls over the serene countryside. Baby’s eyes catch the sign: KELLERMAN’S... and faintly, WE HEAR the opening beats of BE MY BABY. Like a memory. Like a heartbeat. Then it’s gone. Baby pulls the car over. Gets out. From this vantage, Baby can see all of Kellerman’s: HOTEL, GROUNDS, GAZEBOS, DOCKS, LAKE. Jake steps up beside her. Baby stares down at the resort. At her past. BRIDESMAIDS rush through the lobby toward an open BALLROOM. They line up beside a handful of GROOMSMEN. Jake looks around. Okay, he’s impressed. Baby comes over. She hands Jake a ROOM KEY. Glances around. It’s exactly the same. Everything. Almost as if she walked back in time. A CONSTRUCTION CREW works on several new outdoor areas. A huge new gazebo has begun to take shape on the lake. Jake stands on the veranda, watches the action. He spots: CAMILA (19). An exotic beauty. Walking right toward him. She trots up the stairs. He puts on his sexiest bad-boy grin: She looks at him. He’s hot. But she immediately shuts it down. Smiles politely, but not warmly. She joins CARLOS (17) at the front lobby doors. Carlos grins at Jake. Camila takes his hand. Baby steps up beside Jake. Her eyes roam the grounds. He’s still looking at Camila. She and Carlos go inside. He heads inside. Baby watches him go. Um, okay. She turns to look at the lake. She’s really back. Baby walks. Deep in thought. Finds herself at: Baby stands on the exact spot where she confronted her father so many years ago. You let me down, too. She reverently touches the railing. Music drifts out. Camila and Carlos are dancing together. Jake doesn’t recognize the dance, but they’re really good. Camila stops. Gives Carlos a correction. They dance again. Jake leans against the doorframe, watching them. Wow. He stares at Camila. Not hiding his interest. Carlos whispers: Camila glances at Jake. He smiles at her. She ignores him. He spins Camila out to face Jake. He is insanely hot. She stops dancing. Goes to the door. She closes the door in his face. Baby steps onto the bridge, looks out at the water. At Kellerman’s, on the hill. Her eyes go distant, remembering: She crosses the little bridge until she gets to: EXT. STONE STEPS They’re exactly as she left them. She touches a handrail. She takes a moment, lets the memories wash over her... ...as she stops in front of the STAFF CABINS. She looks across to JOHNNY’S CABIN. Old. Weathered. But still standing. She stares as the door opens and a YOUNG BABY walks down the steps, followed by a shirtless Johnny. Baby walks toward the memory... Baby opens the door... and walks inside. The cabin’s been vacant awhile. Basic furniture: Bed. Chair. Steamer trunk. Standing mirror. Baby takes it all in. She touches the chair. Hesitantly sits. She stares into the mirror. Looking for Young Baby. But only Frances stares back. Camila and Carlos step out as a 1955 PORSCHE 550 SPYDER roars up the driveway. Carlos gawks. The car stops right in front of them. MR. STANTON (50s) gets out. He has that old-money arrogance about him. Sees Carlos: He tosses Carlos his CAR KEYS. Carlos grins. Sweet! She gives Mr. Stanton his keys. The VALET, a young Latino man, hurries up to the car. Mr. Stanton gives him the keys without a second glance. Guests gather for the group dance class. Some have already paired off and are dancing to the upbeat music. Baby and Jake stand at the railing. Jake checks his watch. Not quite 5:00. No Camila yet. Jake hesitates. Baby pulls him onto the dance area. Baby pulls Jake’s arms up. Nudges his elbows. She makes a circle with his arms and steps into them. They dance. Jake’s not bad. Baby’s having a great time. Jake smiles, too. NOAH (27), handsome and charming, taps Jake’s shoulder. Jake looks to Baby. Jake hands her over to Noah. Heads off the dance floor. Noah pulls Baby into his arms. He pulls her closer. He’s an experienced dancer. Skilled. Baby moves with him. Okay, she’s got this. Jake watches Baby dance with Noah. A handful of BEAUTIFUL GIRLS sidle up beside him. Jake gives the girls a rakish grin. They all pout. Then Camila and Carlos arrive. Baby’s dance with Noah has taken on some heat. Noah pulls her even closer. Baby misses a step. Laughs at herself. Baby falters. Suddenly awkward. Unsure. Is he flirting? Noah lets her go, a bit reluctantly. Jake can’t take his eyes off Camila. Carlos walks up to him: Carlos stares Jake down. Or he tries to. Jake stares back. Jake grins. Pushes off the railing. Heads toward Camila. Jake stops in front of Camila. Holds out his hand. Music starts. A long beat, then she cooly steps into his arms. She fits perfectly in his arms. She feels it. Too much. She pulls away, keeping space between their bodies. The Beautiful Girls sneer at her from the railing. She doesn’t believe him. She leads him into a turn. Baby makes her way through the crowded pavilion. She has two drinks. Camila smiles at Jake. Walks away. Jake stares after her. Then he looks to Carlos, who’s laughing. The layout and decor haven’t changed since 1963. Jake watches a WAITER deliver a pasta dish to a table nearby. Baby follows his gaze. Looks past the table to the BAR AREA. Noah watches her. He smiles. Raises his drink. Baby pulls her eyes away. She looks at Jake. So familiar. She studies him. Looking so deeply that he has to look away. Jake looks up. Does she mean...? She nods. Jake shrugs. Her eyes hold his until... The waiter arrives at their table with a DRINK for Baby. Baby’s eyes shoot to Noah. He stands. Starts to walk away. He leaves. Baby sees Noah stand. He smiles and heads her way. But Baby gets up. Walks out. Jake follows the sound of MUSIC to a LARGE CLEARING on the far side of the lake. The area is lit by STRING LIGHTS and LANTERNS, crowded with people laughing and dancing. In the distance, a LIGHTHOUSE BEACON shines over the water. Jake makes his way through the crowd. All young people who work there: WAITSTAFF. CATERING. HOUSEKEEPING. Everyone’s dancing. It’s hot. Humid. Sticky bodies entwined. Camila and Carlos are dancing the Mambo as if they created it. A perfect unit. Carlos sees Jake. So does Camila. She STOPS dancing. Carlos sighs. A few other couples stop dancing to see what’s up. Camila makes sure they’re watching before she walks up to Jake: Wow. She’s even more beautiful tonight. Her scowl. Her flashing eyes. He smiles, and steps close to her. Very close. Somebody WHOOPS. A catcall. Camila’s face FLAMES. Camila hurries home. Furious. Carlos follows her, laughing. Moonlight shines through the naked roof beams. Baby stands at the railing. Music drifts to her. Laughter. She leans out. Sees the string-lights and dancing at the lakeside clearing. Kids having fun. She looks over the water. A soft breeze picks up. She closes her eyes, as if waiting for... Nothing happens. She opens her eyes. Turns to leave. Jake lies in bed. Johnny’s hospital wristband in his hand. He stares at it. It’s a SMALL SUITE, with a tiny living area, separate bedroom and separate bath. Baby’s in a chair by the window. Johnny’s letter in her hand. Quiet. Peaceful. The front lawn shines in the moonlight. String-lights twinkle over empty pavilions. The LIGHTHOUSE BEACON makes a sweeping journey over the rippling water, the silent staff-party area, then it’s gone. Summer sun shines on the resort. Guests breakfast on an outdoor patio, paddle canoes on the water, play lawn games. The construction crew unload LUMBER from a truck, prepping for their workday. A few 2 x 12s clatter to the ground. The envelope lies on the floor, Johnny’s handwriting lit by the morning sun shining in the window. A half-empty glass of wine sits on a side table, the open bottle next to it. And still in the chair, letter in her hand: Baby. Asleep. She wakes to the loud BANG of the dropped lumber. She sits up. Jake walks toward the front doors-- Jake turns. The Concierge holds up a stack of message slips. A CREW is building a HUGE GAZEBO. Jake steps over a half-laid BRICK PATH, flips through the messages. All from Anne: CALL ME. WINSTEAD IS CALLING. PAUL, the Foreman, walks to greet Jake: Jake shakes his head, then nods to the framed-out gazebo. Jake sees Camila and Carlos run toward the Main Resort. Carlos waves. Camila snatches his hand from the air. Jake laughs, looks down at the messages. A sudden thought: Neil gives Camila a thick MANILA PACKET. Camila opens the packet. Pulls out PHOTOS: ISABEL and ARIEL. He leaves. She reads the Silverman’s PREFERENCE SHEET. Sighs. Baby drinks a cup of coffee. Jake trots up the steps. Jake’s quiet for a moment. Then: That’s the closest to an apology she’s going to get. She pastes on a friendly smile. Turns. It’s clear Neil’s memories are NOT fond. He looks Jake over. That sounds a lot like a put-down. Jake looks to Baby. Jake follows Baby across the bridge, toward the stone steps. She trots up the stone steps. Jake follows. Jake glances at it. Catches up with her. Baby looks up at the cabin, then sits on a step. That stops Jake. A quick, intense reverence washes over him. He sits beside her. A tiny crack in his tough guy act. That’s heavy news for Jake. He eyes Baby. A few bars of CRY TO ME drift around her. She gives the memory the barest moment, then shakes it off. Jake looks at the cabin, the new information about his dad spinning through his mind. He shakes his head. No. Jake gives her a look. She laughs. It’s now used for storage: WIGS. COSTUME RACKS. PROPS. RECORD PLAYERS. AN OLD VIDEO PROJECTOR. Stacks and stacks of BOXES. She shoves a stack of boxes. One falls. 8MM VIDEO REELS roll onto the floor. Jake picks one up one of the reels. She sees an open box. VINYL ALBUMS. On the top: “Love Is Strange” and Other Bests by Mickey & Sylvia. A long beat. Then Baby reverently picks it up. Jake doesn’t say it, but so does he. She puts the album back in the box. Closes the lid. Jake watches her. She really loved him. Baby and Jake finish their lunch. Jake shrugs, tries not to look too hopeful. He gets up, leaves. Baby watches him go. So much like Johnny. She looks up at him. He sits down across from her, pulls out a small notepad and a pen. Ready to take notes. He waits. And waits. Finally, she smiles: She laughs. Looks him over. Adorable. Jake hurries up the steps, his duffel bag over his shoulder. He puts his hand on the screen door handle. Pulls... ...and takes a reverent step inside. He stands still, as if trying to feel his dad’s presence. He doesn’t. He laughs at himself. Stupid. He drops his bag on the bed. Looks up at a quiet KNOCK on the screen door. It’s Carlos. Jake and Carlos sit in the half-built rafters, legs dangling.  she does is work and rehearse. Jake stands up, inches his way toward the edge of a beam. But Jake’s already pulling off his shirt. He launches himself off and back-flips into the water. He comes up, shakes the hair from his face. Carlos stares down at him. Carlos gingerly gets to his feet. Takes off his shirt. Then... he JUMPS. Splashes into the water beside Jake. Jake and Carlos walk across the lawn. The Spyder roars up, idles in front of the Main Resort. Carlos’s eyes go dreamy. Carlos pales. Jake lets him play it off. Mr. Stanton gets out of the car. Sees Carlos... and tosses him the keys. Carlos stares down at the keys. Mr. Stanton is already walking inside. Carlos starts to say something, but: Jake gets in the passenger side. Waits for Carlos. Jake grins. Carlos looks around. Fuck it. He hops in. She stands in front of the mirror. She looks amazing. Outfit. Hair. Makeup. All perfection. She grabs her room key. Noah looks up as she comes in. Beautiful. He’s about to tell her so when she says: As they’re walking to their table: The Spyder speeds along the curves. Top down. Music blaring. Carlos takes a curve. Grips the wheel. Excited and nervous. Baby and Noah linger over dessert. They’re laughing. Noah goes to pour more wine. Baby covers her glass. He stands. Offers his hand. It’s a bluesy slow song. Baby steps into his arms. Already feeling the nerves. Baby scoffs self-consciously. He pulls her close. Starts to move. The Porsche is half on the road, half in a shallow ditch. The boys are behind the car, hands on the bumper. Jake laughs. Carlos pushes too early. Too hard. His foot slips. He yelps. Carlos grabs his ankle. He tries to stand up. Ow. Ow ow ow. A CAR stops on the road. A POLICE CRUISER. The doors open. Jake hefts Carlos to his feet. Carlos stares at the cops. The cops study Carlos... the car... Carlos. Jake flashes an easy, carefree grin. This is familiar territory for him. Carlos looks to Jake. The cops ignore Jake. They’re focused solely on Carlos. Baby lets herself into her room. Closes the door. Goes to the mirror. As she brushes her hair, she smiles at her reflection. It wasn’t a terrible night. Baby opens and closes drawers. All empty. She zips her suitcase-- RING RING. The telephone. The bedside CLOCK reads: One o’clock. She grabs the phone. Baby’s silver Mercedes is parked in the lot, beside an old PICK UP TRUCK. The station door opens. Baby comes out, followed by Carlos’s parents: ESME and JULIO, both 40s. Behind them, Jake and Carlos. Carlos limps. Leaning on Jake. Baby’s car pulls up to the front. Jake gets out. Slams the door. Walks toward the Nature Trail. Baby gets out. He stops and turns, sullen. He knows he should say goodbye, he should thank her, and he wants to. But: Baby watches him go. That’s all? She sighs, looks for the Valet. Another young Latino staffer walks by. That’s not him. He hurries toward her from the lawn. She gives him her keys. Baby’s overnight case is open on the bed. Packed and ready to go. She puts Johnny’s letter inside. Closes the case. A CREW works on the new brick path. Jake, in a RED CREW WORK SHIRT, pushes a wheelbarrow loaded with bricks. Baby walks out, carrying her overnight case. Her car is there, waiting. She puts the case in the trunk. Overhears: She turns. Nearby: Carlos and Mr. Stanton. Carlos is on crutches, a MEDICAL BOOT on his foot. Baby walks over. Baby looks to Carlos. He looks like he might cry any second. She’s unpacking. On the phone. The sun beats down on Jake, who’s laying brick. He looks up as Camila walks toward the Main Resort. Jake jumps up. She doesn’t stop. He starts to run after her, but sees Paul. Shit. He goes back to work. Baby makes notes on a legal pad. Focused. Baby keeps writing. Smiles. The Crew pack up their tools. Jake stands. Fuck, he’s tired. Jake heads toward his cabin. Sees: Baby. In the Old Gazebo. Baby sits in a chair, legal pad in her lap, full of notes. She watches the late-day sun on the water. Jake trots up. A LARGE CABIN, situated far off the path, away from all the other staff cabins. Jake KNOCKS on the door. Camila answers. Carlos hobbles out the door. She goes back inside. Slams the door. Wait. He scans Jake’s body. They’re about the same size. Fair point, and tempting. Jake thinks on it. Baby and Noah have dinner. Baby’s laughing. On the walls: Photographs of old-school starlets: Rita Moreno. Cyd Charisse. Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. There’s only one modern photo: JENNIFER LOPEZ as a FLY GIRL. Camila sits on the bed. Stares at the starlets. Her dreams. Jake’s found some old memorabilia. PHOTOS. Young people from the 1950s. Poodle skirts and pompadours. Then from the 1960s. Peddle-pushers and Keds. Until he comes to... A PHOTO of a man in the center of a group of DANCERS. Tight white T-shirt. Smoldering eyes. Johnny Castle, circa 1963. Jake stares at the photo. He goes to the wall-length mirror, mimics Johnny’s pose. Is it in his blood? The Lighthouse BEACON sweeps over the water. String-lights twinkle. Music plays. Staffers loiter and dance in the open area. Jake mingles among the staffers. He sees Carlos crutching his way toward him. But no Camila. Jake’s disappointed, but kinda relieved. Then... Camila walks up to them. Looks Jake up and down. She nods. The crowd parts as she walks to the dancefloor. Someone changes the music. Jake straightens. He’s got this. He moves to join her. Camila pulls him close. For a moment, they move together. They look good. Then she proceeds to out-dance him so spectacularly that he’s left standing still as she dances around him. Twirls, spins, deft footwork. And everyone has stopped dancing to watch. The music stops. Camila slinks back to him. Sexy. Dominant. She laughs. Jake doesn’t. Her eyes meet Carlos’s. He’s disappointed in her. He limps away. Shit. To Jake: He walks away. Baby and Noah are on the small dancefloor. It’s a simple Salsa. Baby’s surefooted. Graceful. Then Noah changes it up. He moves differently. Pulls her closer. Baby stiffens. He moves in rhythm with the music. Baby tries to relax. He pulls her even closer. For a second, she melts. Then she steps back, gives herself a little space. But he takes a proper stance. And they Salsa. Jake catches up with Carlos. Jake stops. He’s looking at... the Rehearsal Cabin. Jake stands outside Baby’s room. He hesitates. Then knocks. Baby and Jake sit by the window. Jake’s quiet. Finally: The RECORD PLAYER is set up. Baby puts an album on. Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons: Big Girls Don’t Cry. Her hair falls in casual, loose curls. She wears denim shorts and a button-up shirt. She ties the bottom of her shirt, unconsciously mimicking her look from that summer. She looks around the cluttered room. Time to work. She starts clearing the center of the room. Jake carries a BAG OF CEMENT on his shoulder. Baby walks by. Gives him a thumbs-up. He smiles. It’s on! Baby starts up the front steps. Noah’s at a table, poring over a SEATING CHART. Baby detours. Heads his way. He looks up. She looks vibrant. Carefree. Beautiful. Baby’s on the phone. She kicks off her shoes while she waits: She turns on the shower. Catches sight of herself in the mirror. YOUNG BABY looks back. No... she looks down at herself, the hair, the shirt, the shorts. She looks back at the mirror. It’s not YOUNG BABY. It’s her. Baby, showered and changed, sits at the table with Julio, Esme, Carlos, and Camila. Esme slaps Carlos upside the head. Camila slaps him, too. He glares at her. Camila fumes, stands up. Leaves the room. Carlos sighs, miserable. Baby reaches across. Touches his hand. Julio, in a beige Kellerman’s work shirt, trims topiaries. Esme, in a beige Kellerman’s maid’s uniform, pushes a cart. Guests paddleboard on the lake, ride in pedal boats, drift in canoes. Music plays loudly from nearby... The 5:00 group dance class is winding down. Camila says goodbye to the guests. Carlos sulks against the railing. He perks up when he sees... ...Jake. Headed straight for them. Full of Castle swagger. Now Camila sees him, too. Ugh. He walks right up to her. A long beat. Camila eyes them both. Shit. A perfectly manicured English Garden, complete with benches, topiaries, lighted cobblestone paths, and lots of roses. Baby glances at him. She stops to smell a perfect rose. He picks the rose. Hands it to her. Baby and Noah walk toward the Main Resort. Baby carries the rose. She stops when she sees a CAR in front of the building. She stares as Daniel hands his keys to the Valet. Baby hurries away from Noah, toward the car. Baby reaches the car just as Lola and Lisa get out. Lola runs up to her mom. Wraps arms around her. Lisa lugs a suitcase from the trunk. The Valet takes it. Baby glares at her. She’s part of this? Noah walks past them. Gives Baby a long look. Glances at the rose, still in her hand. Baby looks down at the rose. Shit. Noah pulls his eyes from her and walks inside. A pair of linen pants lay across the bed. Baby takes off her denim shorts. Looks up to see Daniel. She throws her denim shorts at him. He catches them. Daniel considers that. He leaves the room. Baby comes in dressed for dinner. She’s reverted to sleek, refined Baby. Not the soft, casual Baby we just saw. Daniel has her legal pad out, reading over her notes. She snatches it away from him just as-- KNOCK KNOCK. She goes to the door. Lisa and Lola come in. She gives a key to Daniel. Baby and her family are seated at a center table. Neil’s stopped by the table to chat up Lisa. His eyes gleam as they rove over Lisa. She flirts right back. Baby’s fidgety. Uncomfortable. Watching the door. Lisa shoots a look to Baby. Jake’s here, too? She stands. But just then... Noah walks in. His eyes meet Baby’s. Shit. She hesitates between standing and sitting. Lisa sees Noah. Oh! Baby comes in, Lisa hot on her tail. Nope. Baby turns around and walks right back out. Middle of dinner. Neil has pulled up a chair and made himself at home. Baby picks at her food. Neil chats up Daniel. His voice fades as Baby sneaks glances at Noah, alone at a nearby table. Picking at his own dinner. Daniel and Neil walk out of the Dining room. Baby, Lisa, and Lola come out behind them. They peel off from Neil and Daniel and head toward the elevators. Baby looks at her watch. She’s going to be late. Baby sighs. Dear. God. The room’s cleared, boxes shoved into all corners. Baby has changed into athletic wear. She and Jake stand face to face. Lisa and Lola wait, hopeful. Lola trots to the record player. Lisa pulls out albums. Lisa chooses an ALBUM. Baby pulls Jake to stand in front of her. Sizes him up. Jake stands taller. Locks his ‘frame’. Lola puts the needle down. Music PLAYS. Baby’s talking low, we can’t quite hear her. She puts her hand over his heart, her fingers tapping softly... Lola watches, enraptured. Lisa leans down, whispers: The little group say their goodnights. Jake walks toward his cabin. Baby and Lisa turn to go. Lola watches Jake walk away. Baby smiles sweetly. So true. Jake comes in. Stops in front of the mirror. He grabs the photo of Johnny (with the dance group) from his nightstand. He puts his hand over his heart. Two fingers tapping... Jake closes his eyes... and practices the steps. Baby, Lisa, and Lola come in. Lisa and Lola leave. Baby goes to the... The Concierge gives her a small card and a ROSE, the same kind of rose Noah gave her earlier. She pulls out the card. The front of the card says: For you. She smiles. Turns the card over and it reads: Love, Dan. Her smile drops. He opens the door. Baby, rose in hand, walks inside. She turns. Leaves. Jake eats lunch with the crew. Carlos comes by. Plops down. Grabs the bag of Jake’s chips. Jake tries to grab them back. The Valet holds Baby’s car door open for her. She’s about to get in when a HAND touches her shoulder. Noah. Baby looks up at him. God, he’s sweet. Noah’s surprised. Really? Baby misreads his hesitation. She gets in the car. She puts on her seatbelt. Sighs. And the passenger door opens. Noah climbs in. Lisa and Lola step off the elevator. Neil walks past them, gives them a WINK. He’s wearing GOLF TOGS. Lisa smiles. Lola rolls her eyes. Ew. Jake comes out with PAINT CANS. Loads them into a truck. Jake drives slowly down a provincial street. He sees Camila walk into the SMALL PUBLIC LIBRARY. He stops the truck. Jake looks around. Where is she? Jake walks into the DARKENED room. One TV is on. A B&W MOVIE plays. Watching the movie: Camila. With headphones on. He sits on the edge of the table. She pulls off the headphones. Ugh. She turns off the TV. Walks toward the door. Lisa and Lola are in a PEDAL BOAT. Lola pedals easily. Lisa’s panting, exhausted, pedaling by rote as she tells her story: Damn, she’s tired. She stops pedaling, panting. Sweaty. She turns around. The shore is waaaaay back there. Baby and Noah get out of her car. Baby talks to a CLERK. He hands her a MANILA ENVELOPE. She opens it. Pulls out a legal-looking form. We see CARLOS FLORES, DEFENDENT printed at the top. Baby’s eyes skim casually, unconcerned-- Wait WHAT?? Baby argues with the PROSECUTOR’S CLERK. A door opens. LESTER SIMS (60s) comes out. Cold. Stern. He goes back into his office. Baby follows. Baby’s about to argue when he adds: Baby comes out. Furious. Noah’s waiting outside. He has a couple of boutique shopping bags in his hand. Baby nods her thanks. He takes her hand. Baby fumes. Daniel, still in his golf togs, sits pensively. She stops. Glares at him. Their eyes meet. A spark. Heat. He stands up. Goes to her. She considers it. Then pushes him away. Daniel nods. His eyes linger on her lips. Baby wavers. She pushes him toward the door... and out. She closes the door. Whew. That was close. But now... she’s all keyed up. He comes in after a shower. Wet hair. Low-slung lounge pants. Shirtless. Towel around his neck. Jake turns. Camila’s standing in the open door. Her eyes involuntarily lock on his naked skin. He pulls the towel from his neck, stands straight, lets her look at him. He smiles that sexy smile. Lisa and Lola are crashed out on the bed, in hotel robes. Face down. Baby walks in. Lisa’s muffled voice comes from the bed: They both stir. Sit up. Sunburned faces. Lola looks tired, but Lisa looks beat to hell. They both plop back down. Baby smothers a laugh. Baby comes out of the room. Thinks. Baby knocks on a door. Noah answers. Surprised to see her. Jake walks in. Camila and Carlos are already there. Jake walks up to her. Stands like Baby taught him. A small venue filled with the town’s young people. Drinking, smoking, dancing. In the middle of the kids: Baby and Noah. Baby still holds herself apart from him. But she’s trying. A little looser. A little more free. Jake and Camila are sweaty. Tired. Frustrated. Camila and Jake share a look. Fake it. Jake shakes out his arms and legs. Carlos starts the music. They try again. He can’t get the steps. Shit. She patiently shows him the sequence: one-two-turn-three... -- REHEARSAL CABIN: Jake watches Baby’s feet. They become... -- BALLROOM: ...Camila’s feet -- a BLUR of precise motion. -- FLORES HOME: Baby’s at the table with the whole family, a  file and her legal pad in front of her. -- JAKE’S CABIN: Jake practices in the mirror, his dad’s  photo propped up, as if it’s watching him. -- DANCE CLUB: Baby and Noah dance. She’s looser. More free. -- GROUNDS: Paul hands out paychecks. Jake opens his. Smiles. -- REHEARSAL CABIN: Jake’s feet move faster. He’s got it!  Lisa and Lola applaud. He takes Baby’s hand. TWIRLS her  out. She SPINS away... -- BALLROOM: ...and Camila slinks sexily back to him. He  swirls her around then PULLS her hard against his chest.  He’s confident. Sexy as hell... ...as he looks down at Camila, pressed against his chest. She pulls away. Flustered. He goes to grab his water. Camila’s eyes lock on his every move. She’s feeling it. God, he’s so... she turns away. Camila, Carlos, and Jake walk home. All tired. Jake peels off at his cabin. She and Carlos keep walking. She can’t argue that. She turns to watch Jake go into his cabin. Carlos catches her looking. The new gazebo is complete. The new brick walkway is complete. All the new structures are nearing completion. Jake’s at the concierge desk. He slips his PAYCHECK into an envelope. Seals it up. A couple of guests come out of the Ballroom, followed by Camila. Jake sees her. Smiles. She walks over to him. The words surprise him. Camila watches the emotions cross his face. Makes a decision: Jake and Camila stand on the dock. The Lighthouse Beacon makes its journey. The beam washes over them, then moves on. A long beat. Camila reaches for Jake’s hand, but she pulls back just before she touches him. He likes being compared to his dad. He smiles. Then admits: Baby dances. She’s free. Having a great time. Noah dances up behind her. She turns and together they’re fluid, intense, hot. Noah is dying. Baby’s into it, too. She runs her hand through his hair. Baby chuckles, pulls his face down to hers. Then she kisses him. And it is HOT. Then she pulls away. She dances away from him. Sexy. He pulls her back to him. Camila looks around. Excited to be there. She goes to the record player. Chooses an album. Something old. Otis Redding on vinyl. She puts the needle down. Music fills the room. That touches Camila. Deeply. She turns away. He misunderstands. He reaches for her hand. God. She can’t take him being sweet. He moves back. Bumps a box and jostles the 8MM VIDEO REELS. They clatter to the floor. One rolls to his feet, spins for a moment, then falls on its side. He picks it up. Jake sets up the VIDEO PROJECTOR. He turns the lights out. The only light now is the moon through the windows. CU: RECORD PLAYER. Scratchy silence as the needle moves to the next song. Another old, slow one: THESE ARMS OF MINE. At the projector, Jake hits PLAY and on the wall: his dad comes to life. It’s a reel of Johnny dancing. Jake stares. Camila looks at Jake. His eyes are glued to Johnny. Healthy. Smiling. Dancing. Jake fights the emotion welling up in him. And Camila weakens. She pulls him into her arms. They slow dance under Johnny’s smiling eyes. Feeling everything. The song ends. They stand like that, not moving. Then Camila steps away. And leaves. Jake watches her go. Turns to his dad. And Johnny dances. Daniel and Neil smoke cigars on the veranda. Chummy. Baby’s car drives up to the Valet. Baby gets out. She’s laughing. Flushed. The passenger door opens. Noah gets out. The men’s eyes meet. Daniel calmly puts out his cigar. Goes inside. Noah comes around the car. Tries to take Baby’s hand. She subtly pulls away. Okay. He goes inside. Finally, the Valet runs up. Takes Baby’s keys. Neil leans over the veranda railing, puffs as Baby heads inside. Jake switches out the reel. More Johnny. More dancing. Learning the part of his dad he never knew. Daniel answers the KNOCK on his door. Baby comes in. A SUITCASE is open on the bed. He’s packing. Baby watches him pack for a long moment. Then: Daniel stares at her. Not at all what he expected her to say. He slams his suitcase shut. Heads to the door. Baby comes in. Hears laughter from the bedroom. Lisa and Lola are on the bed, watching a movie. Beauty masks on their faces. Bottles of nail polish strewn on the bed. They carefully eat popcorn with freshly polished fingers. She climbs onto the bed between them. Wraps her arms around Lola. Lisa can tell something’s wrong. She wraps her arms around both of them. Baby closes her eyes, accepts the love. Baby opens her eyes. The TV flickers in the dark. She sits up. Lisa and Lola are sound asleep on either side of her. Baby walks out on the big front porch. She looks out at the Kellerman’s grounds, whispers: Then she sees someone. Down by the lake, standing in the NEW GAZEBO. It’s all shadows and darkness, but... is that? Tall. Broad shouldered. Tight white T-shirt. It looks exactly like: Johnny. She knows it can’t be him, but she walks... ...across the lawn... down the slope... getting closer. It’s not a figment. He’s there. He’s right there. She walks quietly into the structure. Hesitant. In disbelief. He’s at the railing, his back to her. She can’t be seeing this. It’s not possible. Is it? He turns. It’s Jake, tears on his face. He wipes them away as she joins him at the railing. She puts her hand over his. Jake takes a tiny step closer to her. With their shoulders touching, they watch the water. Jake walks to Paul, tired and bleary-eyed, but ready to work. Jake gives him a thumbs-up. Heads to work. Jake can’t fight a smile. Baby waits outside the JUDGE’S CHAMBERS. The JUDGE sits behind her desk, a file open in front of her. Carlos’s MUG SHOT stares out. Jake still in his work shirt, sits on his stoop. Beside him, an envelope and his paycheck. He has a NOTEPAD on his lap. He stares at the paper. Thinks. Then he starts to write. CU on notepad: Dear Mom. Let me start by saying I’m sorry. I made Dad a promise... Lisa and Baby have salads. Baby stabs at hers.  her hands are tied. Lola walks up. Plops into a chair. Lola glances at Lisa. Baby looks between them. What’s going on? She puts her hand over Baby’s. Very teenage-adult. Baby squeezes Lola’s hand. She grabs Lisa’s. Lola takes Lisa’s hand. The Houseman girls. Baby smiles. THWUMP THWUMP THWUMP. They all look up as a HELICOPTER flies overhead... and LANDS on the front lawn. Lola gawks. Neil hurries by them, flustered. Nervous. He speed-walks toward the chopper. Baby laughs at his frantic pace. Baby looks up to see Noah, standing by their table. The chopper powers down as two WOMEN emerge. ISABEL SILVERMAN (50s) and her daughter ARIEL (20s). Regal as queens. Lisa jumps up. Takes Lola’s hand. Baby watches a line of expensive cars wind up the driveway. People are BUSY. Neil is out front, like a conductor. Jake’s on a ladder. He holds a long GARLAND made of FRESH WHITE ROSES against the wall. The DECORATOR eyes it. A MINI-ORCHESTRA is set up in the back corner. Strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion -- they have it all. Camila and Carlos walk in as a dozen or so EXQUISITE BALLERINAS walk out. Like swans. Long and sleek. She watches the women leaves, her eyes full of admiration. They’re living the life she wants. Professional dancers. She shakes it off as Ariel and her groom TEDDY (20s) enter. Camila turns all sweet, polite business. Very professional. Jake attaches a last sheath of WHITE ROSES to the gazebo. He steps back to look at it. It’s beautiful. Camila dances with Ariel. She leads Ariel into a turn. Looks to Teddy. Carlos stops the music. Teddy takes Ariel into his arms. Carlos starts the music. Noah is in his element. Directing workers and decorators. Baby watches from the veranda. He glances up at her. Smiles. Jake hurries into the cabin, dressed to dance. NOTE: WE ARE NOW THREE DAYS BEFORE THE WEDDING. TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ARRAIGNMENT. Baby hurries in. A TRIPOD and VIDEO CAMERA are set up. Everyone’s there: Jake, Camila, Carlos, Lisa, Lola. Jake and Camila are in sexy DANCE COSTUMES. Camila and Carlos stare at Baby. Barely contained glee on their faces. Baby blinks. She’s confused until: Camila and Carlos are both grinning at Baby. Baby finally realizes... oh. She blushes, waves them away. Baby’s touched. She grabs both their hands. Camila grabs Jake’s hand. Lola starts the music. The dance begins. But we don’t see the dance. We stay on Baby - behind the video camera. She watches Carlos. His happy, innocent face. She turns her attention to the camera. Filming. Baby and Lisa sit on the sofa, drinking wine. Lola’s at the window, staring out at the Lakeside Clearing in the distance. The lights. The dancing. The fun. Lola huffs. Goes in to the bedroom. We hear the TV come on. Baby shakes her head. Lisa winces. Yikes. The Lighthouse Beacon washes over Jake and Camila as they dance. And now, they’re the couple everyone watches. Jake’s good. Really good. He and Camila move together like water. They are a unit. Heat radiates from them. Carlos hangs by the railing, a huge grin on his face. Baby’s sitting up in bed, one hand on Lola, who has curled into her, asleep. But Baby can’t sleep. She’s too worried. Jake and Camila walk along the dock. She stops to lean against the railing. The Lighthouse Beacon washes over her face, then moves on. Jake’s mesmerized. She catches his look. The Lighthouse Beacon sweeps slowly over them again. She turns to him. So close. His eyes close as her fingers trace his cheek, his lips. She pulls his head down. The Beacon washes them in soft light as their lips meet. It’s THE KISS. Passionate, perfect. He picks her up. Her legs wrap around his waist. They lose themselves in each other. Baby roams. Restless. Baby walks. Deep in thought. Baby walks past the old gazebo. Doesn’t even see it. She walks across the bridge and... ...where she doesn’t even look up until she gets to... Jake’s cabin now. Baby stops. How did she end up here? A dim lamp shines inside. She hears talking. Laughter. Jake and Camila. Good for them. She turns, ready to head back... ...and sees a LIGHT is on in the Rehearsal Cabin. Huh. Baby comes up the stairs. No one’s there, of course. She reaches for the light switch. Turns it OFF. A BEAM OF MOONLIGHT shines through the window, right onto: The VIDEO PROJECTOR. It still has a reel on it. Curious, Baby walks over, presses PLAY. The wall lights up and Baby gasps. On the wall: Johnny dances. Baby sinks to sit on the floor. Her eyes linger on him, remembering everything. She watches him dance. Young. Beautiful. Happy. Johnny SPINS SPINS SPINS... She fights tears... She lets out a harsh laugh through the tears. ...and then she finally lets herself cry. STRONG ARMS come around her from behind. Johnny’s arms. She knows they’re not real, but she FEELS them. And we SEE them. She puts her arms around his, clutches them tightly. A long beat. Then she opens her eyes. His arms are no longer there. She’s hugging herself. She stands. Walks to the image of Johnny. She kisses her fingers. Touches them to his face. She walks out of the room, leaves Johnny dancing behind her. Jake lies with Camila in his arms. He’s never been so happy. A few cars are lined up in the front drive. Several MEN (20s) stagger toward the lobby doors, corralled by Noah. He sees Baby walking toward him. Teddy holds out a gallant, but unsteady hand to Baby. Noah gives Teddy’s car keys to the Valet. The other men shuffle toward the doors. They go inside. Noah gives her a quick kiss on the cheek. Then, boldly, a soft, sweet kiss on her lips. He smiles. Leads Teddy inside. Baby touches her mouth. What the hell is she doing? Esme leads Baby to the table. Camila, Jake, Carlos, and Julio are having breakfast. They’re happy, laughing. She shakes her head. Jake, Camila, and Carlos share a look. Camila SLAMS into her room. Grabs her DANCE BAG from the floor. DUMPS it. Shit scatters: dance shoes, binders, the Silverman photos, and... the VIDEO TAPE. She grabs it. Camila flies out the front door. She runs down the... ...toward the lake. Jake runs after her. She just runs faster. In a desperate fury. She gets to the railing and-- --she SLINGS the tape into the lake. It hits with a PLUNK. It floats for a second, then... sinks. She starts to cry. Jake reaches out for her. She jerks away. Then she grabs him. Clutches him. He pulls her close. Camila comes in. She’s been crying. Jake tucks his wallet into his back pocket. Baby comes in. Baby stares at Jake. It’s like a gut punch to her. Jake sits on the bed. What is she talking about? Jake looks at the photo of Johnny. His dad’s face. And starts to cry. Baby wraps him in her arms. Jake and Baby walk back to Camila’s. Camila comes onto the porch. She looks to Baby, who nods. It’s okay. Camila runs down the steps, into Jake’s arms. Paul’s handing out paychecks. Jake takes his with a grin. Camila and Carlos sit on the rail. Jake stands behind them. They all watch the sunset. Quiet. Until... She reaches for his hand. Carlos trembles. Jake puts his arms around them both. As the sun sinks behind the watery horizon... the Lighthouse Beacon comes on. Jake’s in the best clothes he has there. Pressed shirt and jeans. He combs his hair. He looks nice. Camila smoothes her dress. Pulls her hair into a sleek pony. Esme straightens a TIE on Carlos’s neck. Julio holds Carlos’s jacket. They fight tears. And she breaks. Julio hugs his family. Baby, Lisa, and Lola come out. They’re dressed for court. Nice, but not too nice. She’s nervous. Noah hurries out. A pair of KEYS whizzes past her head. She ducks just in time. The Valet catches them, trots toward an idling SPORTS CAR. He heads inside. As he passes Baby: Suddenly, she smiles. Confident. Sure. She kisses Noah hard on the mouth. He grins. Lisa and Lola have found seats with Jake, Camila, Esme, and Julio. Baby’s at the front with Carlos. Carlos starts to stand. Terrified. Baby stands with him, puts a hand on his shoulder: She turns to smile at Lester Sims, the D.A. and his dickhead client, Mr. Stanton. Lester stands. Oh, hell no. But Baby continues. The Judge smirks. She’s loving this. She brings the GAVEL down. Baby grins. She WON! He trots down the hill, toward the Lakeside Clearing. The sun goes down and THWEEP. All the LANDSCAPE LIGHTING comes ON for the night. Jake stops to take it in. Wow. He turns toward the lake to see: THE NEW GAZEBO. Well-built. Fully decorated. All lit up. Beautiful. And Jake realizes... he helped do that. Staff hang-out. Jake has fully taken Carlos’s place. He and Camila burn up the dance area. Carlos dances as well as he can, in his boot. Baby, Noah, Lisa, and Lola make their way into the area. Noah watches Jake and Camila. They are amazing. She laughs. The song ends. Jake sees them. Baby takes it all in. It’s the same, but different. Lola is in heaven. Finally, they’re at the party! Lisa runs to the guy playing the music. Makes a request. Suddenly: PUSH IT by Salt-N-Peppa plays. She yells to Baby: She pulls Baby onto the dance area. Lisa can’t dance at all, but she has a great time. But Baby is killing it. Noah moves to dance with her. Lola stares. Jake hands her a SODA. Baby dances up to Lola, who goes to dance with her mom. Camila whispers to a staffer, who whispers to another staffer, and on and on. Pretty soon, they’re all watching Baby dance. Lola hugs Baby. Baby melts. Jake, Camila, and Carlos join them on the floor. All dancing. All laughing. All happy. Camila pushes Jake down on the bed. Pulls his shirt off. Baby shoves Noah against the wall. She is HUNGRY, and she’s making a meal of Noah. He’s totally fine with that. She unbuttons his shirt. Runs her hands over his muscled chest. Oh my GOD. His body, his skin. So firm. Suddenly: Noah pulls back enough to see her face. He stares down at her. Intense. Sincere. He picks her up, hands on her ass, and carries her to the bed. She pulls him down on top of her. Lisa and Lola have raided the mini-bar. Their loot sits between them on the bed: chips, candy bars, cookies, nuts. Lola bites into a candy bar. She smirks. Lola smirks. Lisa throws a potato chip at her. Camila wakes up. Stretches. Snuggles closer to Jake. Jake pulls her close. She sits up. Tugs at his shoulders. Get up. Jake and Camila walk toward her house. Her eyes keep glancing toward the lake... and the dock... where she threw the tape. She shrugs. Tears her eyes away from the lake, keeps walking. Jake follows behind her. Thinking. Noah’s in front of the mirror, towel around his waist. Baby watches from the bed, the covers wrapped around her. Her eyes trail down his body. He turns. She smiles at him. Plucks at the sheet around her chest. Jake stands in the middle of a flurry of last minute activity. He’s looking for... there he is. Noah directs a couple of guys draping flowers. All the STAFF are assembled. Camila, Carlos, Esme, and Julio stand together. The resort has been transformed into a fairytale of flowers and lights. Walls and arches of ROSES lead to the... ...where chairs are set for the ceremony. It’s magical. A MINI-ORCHESTRA is set up under a tent. The tent is draped in FRESH FLOWERS and VINES. A dancefloor is under its own tent -- with hanging roses and elaborate chandeliers. Arranged nearby: Long tables are set under gauzy tents. Delicate lights dangle above. The tables are adorned in romantic loveliness. HELICOPTERS hover outside the boundaries of the property. Paparazzi eager for shots of the million dollar affair. Jake pulls NEW CLOTHES from several SHOPPING BAGS. He’s been to town. Slacks. Button up shirt. Jacket. Tie. Shiny shoes. Camila gets ready. Puts on a DANCE DRESS. Carlos walks in. Dressed in snazzy clothes -- with his boot. Baby, Lisa, and Lola have also been shopping. A STRINGED QUARTET plays elegantly. Baby, Lisa, and Lola sit in the back row. Lisa looks around, trying to see who’s there. She slaps Baby’s arm. Suddenly, the WEDDING MARCH starts. Everyone stands. TWELVE FLOWER GIRLS walk down the newly-laid brick path. Followed by Ariel. A fairytale vision of bridal beauty. And wealth. Camila talks to the musicians. Getting ready for the reception. Going over the music list. Situated at the edge of the Reception Area for FOOD, DRINKS, etc. Esme and Julio stand behind the table. Ready to serve. A CHEER goes up as Teddy kisses Ariel. They happily RUN down the brick aisle. Everyone stands. Ariel, Teddy, Isabel and guests drink champagne. Baby, Lola, and Lisa are at a table with Neil and other guests. Neil proudly surveys the happy guests. Guests listen politely as the Three Tenors perform. Isabel Silverman sits near the stage. High-class perfection. Jake paces. Carlos chuckles. Camila walks up. Quietly: The Tenors finish their set. The guests clap politely. Camila sees the ballerinas make their way to the stage. Jake and Carlos share a look. The ballerinas finish their performance. The guests clap politely as they bow. Isabel Silverman gives a nod of approval. Well done. The EMCEE walks to the stage. Takes the mic. Noah hurries onto the stage. A NOTECARD in his hand. Jake tenses. Carlos grabs his arm. The Emcee looks down at the notecard. Isabel perks up. Really? Noah hurries up to her. Sits down. Baby, Lola, and Lisa share sharp looks. Neil glares at the stage. He stands up, like he’s going to stop it. Lisa takes his hand. She’s as surprised as they are, but: Jake hurries to take Camila’s hand. She’s in shock. She pulls back. No way. Carlos walks by with a BOOM BOX, makes his way to the stage. Carlos limps onto the stage and smiles to the orchestra. He puts the Boom Box on a stool near the microphone stand. Smiles again. And looks for Jake and Camila. WITH JAKE AND CAMILA Jake takes Camila’s hand. Kisses her knuckles. He leaves her standing there and walks... ...onto the stage. He nods at Carlos to start the music. Carlos presses PLAY on the Boom Box. Fast Latin music flows. Jake stands tall. Perfect frame. Hold his arms out, in position. He sees Camila glance at Isabel. Camila shakes her head: No. Jake nods. YES. Everyone waits. It’s getting a little awkward when finally... Camila SPINS onto the stage and into Jake’s arms. Jake takes her hand, TWIRLS her. She SPINS under his arm as they go into the Samba. It’s fast. Their feet like lightning. Camila is electric. And Jake is her partner. WITH BABY Baby, Lisa, and Lola stand for a better view. Baby laughs. Yes, “they” did. Near the stage, Isabel is rapt. Jake pulls Camila close. He TWIRLS her out... and leaves her on the dancefloor. Camila watches him go. Did he just...? And Camila DANCES. Guests stare. Amazed. Enraptured. Isabel can’t make herself look away. Noah grins. Carlos stands with Esme and Julio. Carlos whispers: Jake looks on. So in love. As Camila dances, she catches his eye, holds out her hand... ...and Jake jumps back into the dance for the big finish. SPIN, SPIN, SPIN, SPIN... and DIP. The music stops. Camila’s cradled in Jake’s arms. He gives her a gentle, sweet kiss. The guests STAND. The applause is overwhelming. Camila looks at Isabel. Noah leans to whisper something in Isabel’s ear. Isabel looks again at Camila, with new eyes. Then... she smiles. She nods and stands to applaud with the other guests. With a regal tilt of her head, Isabel calls them to her. Camila nervously approaches Isabel, Jake right behind her. Camila tries not to scream. Isabel smiles. Looks to Jake. She gives him a smile and walks away. Jake swings Camila around. Kisses her. Then grabs the mic. The reception has moved onto the dancefloor, under the moon and stars and lights of Kellerman’s. Everybody gets down. Ariel and Teddy. Esme and Julio. Lisa and Lola. Carlos and Isabel. Baby and Noah. Over the water, the sun sinks lower... ...and the party rages on. And we see... THE LIGHTHOUSE BEACON. It shines... moves on... shines... ...on Jake and Camila as the music from the party drifts down and they slow dance together on the dock. He holds her close as the Beacon washes over them. The light moves off them. She raises on tiptoes to KISS him. The Beacon shines on them again as he picks her up. Baby and Noah dance. He nuzzles her hair. He sees Ariel beckoning to him. Sighs. He grins. He’ll take it. He kisses her. Walks away. Lisa and Lola run up to Baby. Tears fill Baby’s eyes as she looks at Lisa, who’s also teary. All their memories of Kellerman’s, come full-circle. She takes their hands. The Houseman Girls. And then... the opening beats of PUSH IT by Salt-N-Peppa booms over the loudspeaker. Suddenly, Jake and Camila rush onto the dancefloor, Carlos close behind. Everyone. Together. They gather in the middle of the dancefloor, all singing The music swells and we:
