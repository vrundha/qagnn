 Melissa Hunter We see a festive tiki torch-lit cocktail party from afar. * We’re on the dark docks across the island where a big sign reads: “Amanpulo Island Resort.” A SHADOWY FIGURE sneaks onto the docks and kneels beside a covered boat. He unties the tarp and slides it off like a dress, revealing a gorgeous 1973 Riva Aquarama speedboat. The mystery man unzips a duffel bag and gets to work. A Filipino SECURITY GUARD sees movement on one of the boats. * He gulps and his eyes flick to a bulletin board of WANTED posters of known pirates... printed in five languages and stamped with the logo of the Philippine Navy. The Guard creeps along the dark dock, Beretta M9 in hand. The FIGURE on the back of the boat panics, stumbles back and falls overboard with a SPLASH! The Guard runs to switch on a FLOODLIGHT and sees: The vintage speedboat is now decked out with white streamers and wood letters spelling “Just Married.” TOM FOWLER, a charmingly neurotic Midwestern baseball player, * pulls himself onto the dock in his soaking wet suit. * Tom grabs a towel from the dock and dries himself off. *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 2. Tom checks his phone and sees the time: 8:13. Shit. * CLOSE ON a phone screen with an unsent text that reads: “Tom, * where are you??” The text is stuck in SENDING mode. * WIDEN TO REVEAL the phone is in an outstretched hand, * reaching as high as it can go, trying to get service. The * hand belongs to our bride GRACE RIVERA, confident, dynamic, * and currently stressed the hell out. * She checks the status of the text: Unsent. * Grace takes a deep breath to center herself and then flips * around, walking up the sand toward: * A wedding welcome party in full swing. From Grace’s POV, each * guest waves and smiles at her. She’s the star of the night. * ON GRACE as she scans the crowd, looking for Tom. She greets * people as she passes. She hates this, but she’s good at it. *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 3. RENEE ORTIZ (Grace’s mother, impossibly glamorous and highly * critical) hooks arms with Grace, pulling her toward the bar. * They land at the bar and Renee drops her empty martini glass * as the bartender immediately passes her a full one. *  Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 4. Renee holds up a cocktail napkin printed with a photo of * Grace and Tom, stretched to odd proportions. * CAROL FOWLER (Tom’s mother, a bubbly over-talker in a loud * Hawaiian-print dress) has come up behind Renee. * REVEAL LARRY (Tom’s dad, quiet, agreeable) standing next to * Carol, busy shooting the party on his outdated video camera. * Larry returns to filming. Carol hands Grace a present. * Larry points the camera in Grace’s direction. A waiter passes * with a tray of cocktails and Grace snags one-- * She downs it in one gulp. MARGE, the small buff Filipina owner of the resort, drives Tom in a SPEEDING GOLF CART as he changes into dry clothes. We see a farmer’s tan and a blurry old Detroit Tigers tattoo. Tom pokes his head through a shirt, EYES PANICKED-- Grace opens the gift: A tacky bridal CAKE KNIFE SET covered * in white bows. Renee looks baffled. * ROBERT RIVERA (Grace’s dad, an impressive, charming man in a * designer suit) approaches. He kisses Grace on both cheeks. * He then pivots to see Renee, who backs away one step. * Carol laughs. Everyone else smiles. Grace is in hell. * HARRIETT (40s, bohemian chic, spends lots of time to look * effortless) floats up, handing a cocktail to Robert. * Harriett kisses Robert for way too long before responding. * Harriett holds Grace in an intimate hug she did not want. * Harriett breaks out of the hug and warmly smiles at Renee. *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 8. Renee tries to hurry away alone but Carol catches up. Larry * wanders off, filming the crowd. * The RESORT GOLF CART SPEEDS OVER and Tom jumps out before it stops. He’s now under-dressed in a corduroy sport coat. Grace sees him, and he smiles at her. He still has the power * to knock her off her feet, even at her most annoyed. He * steals two wine glasses and joins his fiancée. * Grace takes both the glasses of wine from Tom. He stiffens up * when he sees Robert and extends his hand for a handshake. * Grace holds up her drinks and shakes her head no. Robert * walks off with Harriett. * Grace kisses him tenderly. A brief intimate moment. * Just then, Tom’s whiskey-breathed teammate RICKY interrupts them. He’s one of those friends you have to constantly apologize for. Sometimes to police officers. Ricky stares blankly for a moment, then: * Ricky corrals Tom away, breaking Tom’s hand away from * Grace’s. She sighs. Alone again. * Her younger sister JAMIE (mid 30s, a New York Cool Girl with * a deadpan demeanor) walks up drinking a tropical cocktail. * Grace sighs and takes a swig of her drink. * MEANWHILE, Ricky lights two cigars and passes one to Tom. * Suddenly, they hear a DEAFENING NOISE as a ISLAND HOPPER * HELICOPTER coming in for landing. It blows napkins and hats away. Makes waves in the pool. Everyone watches with fascination as it touches down and out of the cockpit hops SEAN HAWKINS in a billowing khaki shirt.  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 12. Grace rushes over to Tom, who is downing his drink. * ANGLE ON Sean as he kisses Harriett’s cheek, then bear-hugs * Robert. They lock in a deep embrace. * Grace and Tom approach Sean. He swoops Grace in his arms, * picking her up effortlessly and spinning her around. * Sean looks deeply into Grace’s eyes. * Tom downs the rest of his drink in one gulp. * Guests sit down for a rehearsal dinner set up on the beach. * Grace stands, holding a microphone. * People laugh, seated at long tables under twinkly lights. * Tom pulls out notecards and cues up a SLIDESHOW behind them: * IMAGES of Tom in his baseball uniform with Grace in a fancy * suit. Different worlds but they seem so happy and carefree. * Tom starts getting flustered. He skips to his next notecard. * Crickets. Carol throws out a sympathy laugh. * The tattooed Filipino guy roasting the pig gives a thumbs up. This is ACE, 50s. SLIDE: Tom down on one knee in his baseball uniform, * proposing to Grace on a baseball mound in front of a crowd. * Scattered laughs. Grace covers by laughing too much. Tom, now * in panic sweats, sees Renee scowling. He backpedals. * Tom awkwardly salutes and sits down. Everyone stares, * uncertain whether his speech is over. Grace grabs the mic. * Everyone clinks glasses as the slide show ends, showing a * giant disorganized home screen. * Tom looks out: Renee glares at Harriett. Robert wipes his * mouth on the Grace & Tom cocktail napkin. Larry is asleep in * his chair, but still recording. * Then a KNIFE CLINKS A GLASS: The guests are riveted. Lots of laughs. Grace laughs, transported by the memory. * Everyone laughs, but Robert laughs hard. Tom clocks this. * General “Aww’s” of sympathy. Sean smiles at Grace. Sean’s eyes get glassy. * Everyone laughs and sighs admiringly, except for Tom. He’s * pissed. The third wheel at his own wedding. * Sean winks. Grace laughs. Everyone raises their glasses and * drinks except for Tom because his is empty. * Suddenly JEANNIE, Tom’s soft-spoken, harried sister, stands. * She holds the microphone to Tom’s adorable nephew, SCOTTY, 9. * His mom squeezes his shoulder, proud. Tom smiles. Grace stands in front of the bathroom mirror, in pajamas, * putting moisturizer on her face. She stops, looks at the mirror, and makes a decision. Fluffs her hair. Adjusts her t-shirt so it hangs down low. * She steps out a little seductively... * Tom sits on the bed amid seating name cards, mason jars, and * piles of ribbon, holding a hot glue gun. He looks possessed. *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 18. Tom pulls his hand away from the glue gun. Tom violently tries to shake the ribbon off his hand. Tom looks up to see... Grace seductively taking off her * pajama bottoms to reveal basic cotton underwear underneath. Grace tries reaching for a book on a shelf but is too short. *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 19. Tom grabs the book easily and pulls Grace into his arms. * Tom kisses her and they fall back onto the bed. They share a * tender moment staring into each other’s eyes. They kiss deeply. He sweeps all the name cards off the bed * and his eyes lands on one: SEAN HAWKINS. * Grace sits up and puts her shirt back on. * There’s a KNOCK on the door. Weird. They open it and see Tom’s mom, Carol, in a nightgown. Tom looks at Grace, surprised. She’s clearly annoyed with him * and happy to have the space. Tom lies on a sleeper-sofa listening to his parents’ SNORING. He peeks over the couch at his parents, who are still spooning in their jammies after all these years. It’s everything he wants, but right now he’s about to marry a woman he’s never felt farther away from. The next morning, MUSIC PLAYS as we tour Amanpulo from above and finally get why Tom picked it: a gorgeous green firework of an island surrounded by turquoise ocean. The Northern coast is sheer red cliffs topped with green jungle, speckled with guest bungalows... The Southern coast is the main resort complex: a thatched roof lobby connected to a dining cabana. Marge directs her * staff to set up decorations and lights. And Ace sets up * fireworks by the pool. * At the docks, the Security Guard from last night watches all * the bustling staff. He shakes his head and laughs. * Then he sees a FISHING JALOPY pulling up to the docks... The BOATMAN is a chain-smoking local in sunglasses and a ball cap. He unloads a HUGE CRATE onto the dock and offers a clipboard for the Security Guard to sign. The Boatman smiles and offers a pen. The Guard reads the * delivery slip but doesn’t see a 2ND FIGURE climb up out of * the water right behind him. It’s a dripping wet pirate * wearing a skull-print balaclava. * The Boatman gives a slight NOD to the skull-masked pirate. * BAM! The Pirate shoots the Guard in the back of the head. * HOLY FUCKING SHIT. * He pops the lid off the huge crate and the two men pull the * Guard inside. Then latch it and shove it off the dock. * The crate bubbles and disappears under the water. It took * seconds. The workers on the beach have no idea. The killers hop back onto their boat and swing open the door to the cabin. Sunlight pours in and illuminates: Eight pirates around a table. All their faces are masked with different balaclavas: a DOG, a SKULL, a CLOWN, a SHARK, a * RAT, a TIGER, a GHOST and a LIZARD. * The Boatman puts on a BLACK BALACLAVA. He’s the LEADER. * He opens a laptop and pulls up a website. A wedding website: * “Graciela Rivera and Tom Fowler Say I Do ” * Blood-stained gloves click the mouse and land on ISLAND * DETAILS tab. It’s an illustrated map of the island, marked * with all the weekend’s events and times. * We PUSH IN ON THE MAP toward the ink outline of Bungalow 15. * The bungalow is now a full bride zone. Renee drinks a mimosa. * Grace sits in front of a vanity, in her dress, as Carol * hairsprays her hair. Like, so much hairspray. * On the vanity, a bridal magazine sits open to a page with a * soft, romantic bridal updo. *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 23. As the cloud of hairspray clears, we get a full view Grace’s * updo, with a dramatic hair fall. It’s kind of like the * picture, but on steroids. * Jamie enters the hut, hungover. She catches sight of Grace. * Jamie follows Grace into the bathroom and she buttons the * bodice of her dress. They whisper to each other. *  He’s Tom’s best friend. * Grace glares at her. * Grace walks over to a full-length mirror where we see her * whole look. THE DRESS is a too-tight corset bodice with a * layered tulle skirt. Everyone smiles. Grace looks miserable. * ON GRACE, deep in thought, as her family futzes with her. * Tom ties his bowtie in the mirror as Larry films it. Ricky * pours a stoic Robert some whiskey. Ricky jumps in front of * Larry, directly addressing the camera. * Ricky laughs uproariously. No one else does. * Robert gets up from his chair. * A text pops up on Tom’s phone from Grace: “We need to talk”. * His face drops. This isn’t good. * Ace is putting the finishing touches on the reception space. * Elaborate table settings. Mason jar candles. Flowers. * On the beach, guests are gathering at the ceremony site. He * spots Sean regaling guests with a great story. Fuck that guy. * He hurries along and bumps right into Harriett heading down a * path to the beach. She greets Tom with a warm embrace. * Tom heads up wooden steps where signs point to the Zipline * Course and Nature Walk. * Tom walks on the elevated wooden walkway, looking like he’s * walking to his execution. He sees Grace in a hotel robe over * her dress. Even with his nerves, he’s stunned by her beauty. * Tom laughs. Leans against the railing. Delirious. Nauseous. * The pirates are huddled in the jungle, divvying up grenades * and ammo belts. The Pirate Leader checks his watch. * They load into two Jeeps and drive. * Guests chat amongst themselves, getting refreshments from big * carafes. Carol rushes up to Larry, who is busy filming. *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 28. Two Pirates sweep into the kitchen with shotguns aimed. * COOKS, in the middle of prep, put their hands up, terrified. WAITERS arranging trays drop their food. The Pirates hold fingers to their masks. SHHHHH... Tom takes a step back, like the words hit him in the chest. * A Pirate climbs across the thatched roof to a satellite dish. He pulls out a machete and CHOPS through the cables. THWACK! The guests are now seated, murmuring, looking at watches. * Some of the family (Carol, Larry, Jamie and Renee) huddle * together. Robert walk up to them. * As Marge walks off, Sean pops over to the group. *  Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 30. Tom nods. This is his answer. * Grace looks at him with a gutting realization. * Grace SLAPS HIM HARD. * Grace tugs her engagement ring off, throws it at him. Tom’s * baseball reflexes kick in, and he catches it with one hand. They are both briefly impressed by that catch, then Grace * heads off down the path, furious. Tom calls out: He punches the railing. Fuck. * The Pirate Leader silently directs his men to go down * different trails. Surrounding the beach. Getting in position. * Tom leans on a railing, in disbelief about how everything went so wrong, when Marge pulls up in her golf cart. She pins a boutonniere of tropical flowers to his lapel. Tom shows her the engagement ring in his hand. Glinting in the sun. Marge is shocked. She watches Tom walk off alone. The guests are getting sweaty and losing patience. * Suddenly she SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER. She’s looking over her husband’s shoulder at Pirates spilling * out of the jungle. Guns aimed. * The guests scream as they’re corralled like cattle. One * guest, a middle-aged MAN, tries to make a run for it. * BANG! A pirate SHOOTS the man, grazing his arm. He YELPS. * Tom startles at the ECHOING GUNSHOT coming from the beach. He * looks toward the beach but his view is obstructed by trees. * He cautiously climbs three rungs of a ladder to the ZIPLINE * PLATFORM. He gets dizzy, terrified by how high he is. * But then he sees it: all of the guests surrounded by pirates * with guns. Suddenly every petty resentment in Tom’s brain * vanishes... replaced with one primal mission: Grace, completely oblivious, stomps up the steps to the door: * She enters and sees no one’s here. * She grabs an open champagne bottle and SLAMS THE DOOR. * The wedding guests are marched into the swimming pool in their fancy clothes by masked pirates at gunpoint. * The resort workers are marched elsewhere, held separately. * Everyone is shaking with fear and shock. Larry helps Carol * down the steps into the pool. * Jamie instinctively holds her phone above the water as she steps into the pool. A pirate with a snarling pitbull on his * balaclava (DOG-FACE) aims his gun at her. *  DOG-FACE * Other Pirates aim their guns at Jamie, screaming at her. * Even the hostages starts screaming at Jamie. * Jamie drops her hand, and her phone, into the water. She * sighs dramatically as she watches her iPhone drown. * The Pirate Leader walks to the edge of the pool. He’s * terrifying in his black balaclava, but also charismatic. * ANGLE ON the man who they shot, with a scarf wrapped around * his bleeding arm. * A pirate with a rat on his balaclava (RAT-FACE) holds the * stack of seating chart name cards. He reads off the names: * Robert hesitates. Knowing his wealth makes him a target. Harriett looks at him but he gives her a look to be quiet. * Robert raises his hand and Rat-Face staples the name card to * his suit.  RAT-FACE * Rat-Face walks over to Larry and staples his name card. * Sean wades to the steps of the pool facing the Pirate Leader. * Everyone nods in general agreement. * A Pirate trains his gun on Sean and he wades back slowly. *  RAT-FACE * Ricky gets stapled and then wades over to Jamie, trying to * play it cool. * IN A RAPID FIRE MONTAGE: We see name cards stapled to everyone’s clothes, until they have the “Bride” and “Groom” name cards left over. The Pirate Leader in the pitch black mask glares at his men. ANGLE ON a YOUNG WOMAN in the pool in a white dress. *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 36. No one says anything. Harriett looks around, visibly nervous. * Four pirates stay surrounding the pool. The rest go hunting. Tom sprints towards their bungalow but he hears a SCREAM inside. Oh shit. He’s too late! Grace is SCREAMING in frustration. She can’t get her wedding * dress off, because it buttons up the back. She’s trapped! Tom’s heart is beating out of his chest. He doesn’t know what he’s going to find inside. But he’s got to try. He tries to open the door but it’s LATCHED FROM THE INSIDE-- Tom’s never been so relieved to hear those words. Grace paces, teary-eyed, with a bottle of champagne in hand. * Tom sees a pirate, Dog-Face, coming up the dirt road. He’s * about to see Tom because Tom’s locked outside. Tom scrambles around the wrap-around porch to hide. He bangs on the window shutters (island-style, no glass) and then punches straight through, hurting his hand. Tom climbs through the window cradling his bleeding hand... ...and sees Grace lying on the couch, drinking champagne out * of the bottle. Her eyes widen when she sees Tom. * Tom covers Grace’s mouth with his bleeding hand. She squirms. * Tom pulls her to the door and cracks the shutters to see: Dog-Face, kicking through a door three bungalows down. * Machine gun in-hand. Bullet straps around his chest. Grenade * on his belt. Coming this way. Bungalow by bungalow. He’d see them if they ran out the door. They’re trapped. Grace runs over to the landline and checks it: no dial tone. * BANG! Another door gets kicked down. Grace’s breathing gets * shallow. She starts to panic. * Tom looks at the back of the dress, sees twenty tiny pearl buttons. He starts trying to undo buttons as fast as he can.  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 40. Tom’s frantic eyes land on the hook-latch on the door. Tom runs into the bathroom and cranks the SHOWER on. BANG! Dog-Face kicks through the door! But it’s not their door. It’s the bungalow next door. He scans the room with his machine gun. No one here. * As Tom rips down the mosquito net hanging over the bed--  bathroom door... I jump out and get  him in the net.  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 41. Grace grabs a can of aerosol hairspray from the vanity. * Dog-Face (and his sunglasses!) peeks underneath bungalows for * hiding spots. Tom and Grace are seconds from being found. * Tom snatches a hotel matchbook from the night stand and they WHISPER-ARGUE RAPID-FIRE: They’re interrupted by BOOTS ON THE PORCH. It’s happening! They flatten themselves on either side of the * shuttered door. Suddenly the latch SHAKES as the door is jangled. They’ve never been more scared in their lives. And they haven’t agreed on a plan. They’re each on their own. Tom grips his mosquito net. Grace grips her hairspray. * The door KICKS IN right between them! Sunlight catches the dust and splinters as they settle... Dog-Face sees the empty room and the closed bathroom door with the SHOWER RUNNING. He steps in and-- Tom whips the mosquito net over his head! He gets him!! But Tom freezes up, unsure what to do next. * Grace jumps in and SPRAYS HER HAIRSPRAY-- * Dog-Face is protected by his sunglasses but Tom’s nailed! He SCREAMS, blinded! Dog-Face kicks Grace in the stomach and reels back, slamming * Tom against coat hooks on the wall. Then he rifle-whips Tom’s head, right through the net. Tom spins and hits the floor hard with a sickening THUD. Dog-Face shirks off the net and it lands on Tom’s face. He * aims his gun at Grace. She instantly puts her hands up. * Tom puts his hands up too, flat on his back. Under his own * net. Head bloody. Eyelids glued shut and stinging like hell. * Dog-Face isn’t even out of breath. He grabs Tom’s wrists and binds them with plastic zipties. He does the same to Grace. * Then he uses another ziptie to bind Tom and Grace together. * Dog-Face calmly removes his sunglasses and wipes the hairspray off. Then lifts his walkie-talkie:  DOG-FACE *  I have them. Alive. The Pirate Leader listens on the other end. *  DOG-FACE (OVER WALKIE) *  Bungalow Fifteen. Pick me up. * He turns to a pirate with a skull-print mask (BONE-FACE). * The guests all look at each other, worried. * Dog-Face swigs the open champagne while rifling through their * luggage and dressers. Pocketing random things. * A HORN HONKS outside. Dog-Face peeks out the blinds. * Tom and Grace struggle to get to their feet with their wrists * bound. Tom because he’s half-blind and bleeding from the head. Grace because of her binding wedding dress. * They both fall down. They try again, fall again. Dog-Face pulls Grace up to her feet. * Grace and Tom are marched out to the dirt road where Bone- * Face came in Marge’s resort golf cart to pick them up. * Dog-Face shoves Tom and Grace into the backseat. He loops * another ziptie through a steel bar on the back of the cart. * Dog-Face sighs and buckles her seatbelt. * Dog-Face shoves Bone-Face to the passenger seat and drives. * The hostages huddle together in the pool. The Pirates pace * the patio with guns drawn. * ANGLE ON Jamie biting her nails. Sean wades up to her. * Sean puts his hand on Jamie’s cheek and stares deeply into her eyes. Jamie smiles, hypnotized by his charm. Jeannie puts her hand * on Sean’s bicep. * ANGLE ON Harriett behind Robert, rubbing his shoulders. * Robert closes his eyes as she massages him. Breathing weirdly * through his nose. Carol laughs, and Renee looks at her, surprised. A first moment of connection. The Pirate Leader checks the time, losing patience. * Silence. * Robert shrugs. * Ricky holds out a high five which Jamie leaves hanging. * General “EWWS” and GROANS from the hostages. Except Carol, * who whispers to Larry. * Larry smiles, remembering fondly. * Meanwhile, the golf cart drives across the island. Grace and * Tom sit ziptied to the back. Grace rambles, nervously. * Bone-Face turns around and holds a gun up to Grace’s face. * Grace freezes in fear. He turns back around. She stares at * Dog-Face for a moment, thinking. Then: *  A cigarette would shut her up. Bone-Face gets a pack of cigarettes from his vest and pulls * one out and sticks it in her mouth. * He lights the cigarette with his zippo and she puffs on it. * Grace shoves her lit cigarette onto Dog-Face’s ski mask. When * the ember touches his mask, it IGNITES the hairspray that she * sprayed all over him. His whole mask goes up in flames. Dog- * Face SCREAMS. Grace SCREAMS. Tom SCREAMS. * Dog-Face JUMPS out of the moving cart to extinguish himself. * Bone-Face jumps out to help, but falls, and the back wheel of * the cart RUNS OVER his foot. He YELPS. * The cart continues at high speed down a hill. Tom and Grace * are zip-tied to the back so they go along for the ride... The golf cart wheel catches on a rock and FLIPS. It ROLLS * LIKE A DIE down the sloped jungle and finally settles... Upside down on its roof... Grace, still seat-belted, hangs upside-down above Tom. Both * banged up and bleary-eyed. From Tom’s POV, Grace’s up-do * comes loose above him and her hair falls toward his face. * Tom pulls at the bent steel bar they’re zip-tied to. Trying to dislodge it. He kicks it with his heel. Again and again. Dog-Face is unconscious in the foliage. The stretchy fabric of his mask has fused with his charred, bubbly face. Bone-Face isn’t doing great either. A broken foot and road * rash on his arm. He reaches for his walkie-talkie... but it’s smashed. He staggers forward, disoriented, trying to figure * out which direction the cart went. * Tom and Grace shake to snap the bar to free them. No luck. * Tom pushes against the trunk of a palm tree with his legs * with all his might. * WHAM. He flips the cart over. He LAUGHS triumphantly. * They try to push the bar through the roof of the cart. Tom * gets it a little loose, but then: * The cart starts sliding BACKWARDS down a hill. Tom drags his * foot but the hill gets steeper and they pick up momentum. * Bone-Face hears Grace’s scream. He heads through the thick * jungle foliage toward the sound. * ON THE HILL * Grace looks backward to see where they’re headed. * Tom hoists his long legs over the front seat and reaches the * steering wheel. * He steers the cart to the left JUST missing a palm tree. * Grace looks backward and directs him. * Tom turns right and they avoid a giant ROCK. Grace’s eyes go * wide when she sees: * Tom turns to see the cart is headed toward a sheer cliff with * a 100 foot drop to a rocky shore. * Grace tries to push the gear shift into park with her foot. * She kicks with all her might and the gear shift BREAKS OFF. * She SCREAMS in frustration. * Tom turns the cart sharply to the left which HALTS it feet * away from the cliff’s edge. They SIGH in relief. But then... * The cart now starts sliding backwards AGAIN down ANOTHER hill * toward ANOTHER edge of the same cliff. * Grace drags her steel-toed heels into the ground, trying to * stop them. And Tom pulls like hell on the bar, trying to dislodge it-- * their only way out. * Tom kicks at a weak part of the bar with his heel and snaps * it. Then slides their ziptied wrists off the broken bar... Right as the golf cart rolls over the edge! For a split * second, they’re safe... but Grace gets dragged by the cart! * Her dress is caught! The dress rips free just as the golf * cart plummets down... ...but Grace hangs in mid-air! * ...because her ziptied wrists are still attached to Tom’s and he’s splayed on top of the cliff trying to hold her up. Grace looks down to see the golf-cart CRASH onto ocean rocks! * Grace’s weight is pulling Tom slowly over the edge. He can’t * grab onto anything with his wrists pulled in front of him. * He catches his foot on a tree root. He looks DOWN at Darcy * and the 100-foot drop and his VERTIGO kicks in. He shuts his * eyes tight. * One of Grace’s zip-ties gets CUT by the rocky edge, freeing * her left arm and flinging her gravity even further downward. * Tom opens his eyes and looks at Grace, dangling, hopeless. He * can’t save them. He can’t fix this. They’re gonna die. Finally he stops being pulled over. But it’s not because of him... It’s because of Grace. * She dug her steel-toed shoe into the side of the cliff, using * it as a foothold. * They both freeze, scared to shift their weight a millimeter. Bone-Face reaches the site where the cart crashed and follows * the tracks leading down the hill, gun drawn. * Grace carefully climbs up the cliff-face, dropping her other * heel down to the rocky shore below. Using her free hand, she * climbs onto Tom, using him as a ladder. * She pulls herself over the edge just in time to see Bone-Face * racing down the hill towards them, machine gun out. * BANG-BANG-BANG! Grace scrambles up onto Tom as BULLETS bite * the dirt around them. They hide behind a rock. * BANG-BANG-BANG! --Then silence! Tom steals a peek and sees: * Tom yanks Grace to her feet and charges towards him but Grace * runs the other way so they go nowhere and HIT THE GROUND. Bone-Face reloads bullets one-by-one into his magazine. He sees Tom and Grace sprinting at him! It’s a race! * He locks the reloaded magazine and raises to shoot but-- Tom does a killer baseball slide right into his ankles! Grace’s dragged to the ground, skinning her elbows-- * Bone-Face scrambles up from his fall. He tries to swing his * gun around but Tom head-butts him. Bone-Face’s gun FLIES * across the ground and off the cliff. * Grace sees Bone-Face unclip a grenade from his belt-- * Grace uses all her strength to pull her (and Tom’s) hands * towards it and grab the grenade-- --But Tom’s hands aren’t guarding his face anymore so he gets PUNCHED RIGHT IN THE NOSE. Grace and Bone-Face play tug-of-war with the grenade as Bone- * Face chokes Tom with his other hand. Tom can’t breathe, his arms are tied, so he KICKS Bone-Face * as hard as he can. * Bone-Face flies backward, his head landing on a SHARP ROCK. * CRACK. Blood pools out behind his head. And then: silence. * The Pirate Leader looks through binoculars. Nothing. * Two pirates (SHARK-FACE and GHOST-FACE) nod and head down a * trail, walking past a sign with arrows pointing to the * destinations: “Bungalows, Nature Walk, Zip Line Course”... * Tom and Grace, bloody and full of adrenaline, scramble to * stand. Bone-Face lies still, his bloody head hidden from view * behind a rock. * Tom tilts his head to see a VERY bloody mess where the * pirate’s head used to be. * THEN, it sinks in: Grace suddenly shoots her head up at the sky. *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 56. Tom looks out to the coastline, trying to think of a plan. He * distantly sees the dock with the Riva Aquarama. A pirate * (LIZARD-FACE) sits on the dock. Guarding it. * Grace proudly lifts the grenade in the air. Tom’s eyes widen. * Grace’s still looking up so Tom chooses his words carefully. * Tom dips his head towards the dead masked pirate. Tom tries to open the guy’s vest pockets with his teeth. Grace looks over... and regrets it. * Grace breathes deeply. She is NOT good with blood. * Grace yanks her ziptied hand (and both of Tom’s hands) into * Tom’s inside suit pocket pulling out: HER CELL PHONE. * They step over the dead pirate and head into the jungle... Robert is out of the pool arguing with the Pirate Leader. The * hostages in the pool watch on, nervously. * ANGLE ON the Pirate Leader, who has Robert by the arm and * SHOVES him back into the pool with a loud SPLASH. Hostages * scream. Harriett rushes up to him. * The hostages starts looking more panicked. Carol makes eye * contact with the nearest Pirate and speaks in a loud voice. * That kicks off a whole tearful, panicked CHORUS: I’m Jeannie and this is my My name is Jen Gardner. I am Bleeding Guy takes the chaotic moment to hoist himself out of * the pool and make another RUN for it. Rat-Face immediately * SHOOTS him in the OTHER arm. He YELPS and falls down. * ON Ricky and Jamie: * Tom and Grace climb over vines and logs. Grace’s free hand * holds the grenade and their zip-tied hands hold the phone. * Grace pulls their hands to her head and she pulls something * out: her hair extensions. She shoves them into Tom’s pocket. * Tom laughs. * Grace checks the phone: Still no service. * This hangs there a little. Then: Grace laughs. Tom looks at her for a moment, wanting her to * say more, but then Grace’s dress gets snagged on a branch and * she trips, bringing Tom down with her. She drops her phone and nearly drops the grenade. Holy shit. * They sigh in relief. That was close. Then Grace notices: * Grace excitedly shows her phone Tom: ONE BAR of service. * She moves their arms wildly in the sky, hoping to get the bar * back. Then her eyes lands on something with an ide. * Tom turns to see what Grace is looking at: A rickety vertical * staircase with a sign that reads: “TO ZIPLINE PLATFORM.” * Ghost-Face and Shark-Face walk up the road... right past Dog- * Face’s unconscious body, in the foliage, without knowing. * CLOSE ON Tom, eyes closed tight, sweating bullets. * REVEAL they are walking up the vertical stairs, nearing the * platform. Tom is on the verge of a panic attack. * Grace ignores him as they land on the top of the platform. * She dials. As she does, she’s startled by a piercing SHRIEK. * Then a WHOLE CHORUS OF SHRIEKS. It’s a gang of long-tailed macaque monkeys. High up in the trees, surprised to be five feet away and eye-level with a couple of humans. Shark-Face and Ghost-Face are hiking deeper into the jungle * when they hear the SHRIEKING. They look at each other and detour toward the sound... * BACK WITH TOM AND GRACE * The macaque monkeys are trying to scare Tom and Grace off, * guarding a crab they were feasting on. BANG! A bullet whizzes through the air, causing the monkeys * to FLEE and Grace to DROP HER PHONE. The phone falls down to * the jungle floor where we see: * Shark-Face and Ghost-Face, 500 feet ahead of them, aiming * their guns at Tom and Grace from the jungle floor. * Grace head nods to the SADDLE in front of them connected to * the zipline. BANG! Another bullet flies right past them. * BANG-BANG-BANG! Shark-Face fires more warning shots. * She’s had enough. She shoves Tom onto the saddle, straddles * him and KICKS OFF the platform. * Tom SCREAMS in terror as they CAREEN at through the jungle, * the line leading them right over the Pirates on the ground. * The Pirates SHOOT in their direction. One bullet whizzes * right past Grace’s head. * They gain speed, getting closer to the pirates. Grace makes a * silent decision. Just when they are over the pirates, Grace * trapezes upside down and releases the grenade from her hand. * The spring-loaded handle pops off as it falls! * The grenade lands right between the pirates and... * They’re blown to pieces. The zipline gains speed as Grace and Tom fly off SCREAMING. * The hostages cry out in horror and the pirates stare stunned * at the trail of smoke snaking up over the distant jungle. * No reply. Uh oh. He’s angry now. Everything is going wrong. * The Pirate Leader aims his gun at the hostages and shouts: * The hostages swim to the deep end, terrified. Renee, * seemingly frozen in fear, stays in the shallow end. * ANGLE ON Carol, lounging in a floatie. She pushes a matching * floatie to Renee, who takes it graciously. * The Pirate Leader rushes toward the jeep with Tiger-Face. * Clown-Face starts up the jeep as the Pirate Leader hops in * and they speed into the jungle towards the smoke. * Tiger-Face and Rat-Face stay back to guard the pool. Tiger- * Face throws a few more floaties and noodles to the hostages. * Grace and Tom are FLYING down the zipline. They careen toward * a zipline platform by the ocean. Grace dismounts perfectly, * like a superhero. Tom falls off the saddle, flat on his back. *  Tom, look... * Tom turns around to see they landed right where the ceremony * was supposed to take place. Literally right in front of the * rows of rented white chairs. * They see purses left behind in the chaos. Tom sees a plastic water cup with “Carol” written in sharpie. His poor mom. The refreshments table with a white table cloth and a glass * dispenser of cucumber water. The wooden arch covered with * flowers, wilting in the hot sun. Tom looks at Grace and sees her eyes are glassy. It’s * emotional being here. The wedding that never was. The Pirate Leader and Clown-Face stand at a crater of gore, * trying to make sense of this gruesome tableau. They see parts * of their comrades, but no trace of Tom and Grace. * He lifts a shredded mask of one of his men. Affected. Then they hear RUSTLING in the banana trees. They all aim their guns... ready for anything... ...when out staggers Dog-Face, with his burned face. Tom holds the silver faucet open and gulps down water from * the big glass vat on the refreshments table. Grace looks out at the shimmering ocean to the next island on * the horizon, with lots of colorful sails. It’s a busy marina. * Grace and Tom look at each other, surprised. They whisper: * Grace and Tom follow the sound of the voice up a hillside. As * they crest the hill, they see the pool through palm fronds: All their loved ones are huddled shivering in the pool in their fancy clothes. Pirates pace with guns. * ANGLE ON Carol and Renee, indeed both on floaties. * Grace stares at her parents in the pool, turned away from * each other. * Grace tries to fight the emotion. She can’t look Tom in the * eye, so she stares forward at her parents in the pool. Grace shakes off her tears and puts up her tough veneer. * Grace looks where Tom is pointing: Robert giving Renee his * straw hat. He gives her a warm smile. She nods at him, * grateful. Grace can’t believe it-- the first nice moment * between her parents in years. Tom points. ANGLE ON Ricky blocking Jamie from the sun.  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 70. ANGLE ON Tom’s nephew, Scotty, who suddenly spots Tom and Grace through the palms. He gets excited and waves at them. * Everyone in the pool turns around, looking towards where he’s pointing. Rat-Face spots them and races toward them. * Tom and Grace sneak into the resort kitchen. It’s a MESS: * The stove is on, left by the cooks who were taken hostage. * Sinks are running over. Cold appetizers sit on the counters. * They turn off the stove and the sink and looks through * drawers. Grace pulls him toward the appetizers. * Grace puts a tray in front of him. They both eat ravenously. * Suddenly, the SOUND of pirates outside-- boots and a voice on * a walkie-talkie. Grace and Tom freeze. Grace pulls him to... * They swing open the heavy door and see: A perfect tiered wedding cake on a rolling cart. * Tom looks under the rolling cart and sees the cake knife set with a post-it note from his mom on the top: “Don’t forget! Love, Carol (Mom).” Tom points at it. Grace gets emotional. * Grace grabs the knife and tries to cut the ziptie with her * free hand. She awkwardly saws but it doesn’t penetrate the * hard plastic. She saws harder. Grace sees Rat-Face outside a window, searching for them. * They duck their heads down to hide from view. * And then Tom sees through the door back in the kitchen: An * INDUSTRIAL MEAT SLICER. His eyes light up. * Rat-Face creeps past the kitchen doors slowly, eyes wide, * listening closely. Hunting with determination. * Tom and Grace hold out their connected wrists inches from the * meat slicer’s massive circular blade. Grace looks panicked. * Grace cautiously presses a button. The blade WHIRRS to life. * They slowly slide their wrists toward the rapidlt spinning * blade. It’s terrifying. Grace yanks them back. * She nods and puts their wrists back on the surface and slowly * move toward the blade. ON TOM, staring straight ahead... * ON GRACE, opening her closed eyes. * As they make contact, Grace FLINCHES, pulling Tom’s wrist a * centimeter closer to the blade. Before she can correct it... * SWISH. The blade cuts through the zip-ties and slices deep * into Tom’s hand. Tom goes sheet-white. Shuts his eyes. * Rat-Face hears the cry inside the kitchen and rushes back * toward the door. * Tom, in intense pain, whispers to Grace. He can’t look. * Grace looks at Tom’s hand GUSHING BLOOD down her dress. NOPE. * Grace passes out and hits the floor just as... * Rat-Face KICKS OPEN the kitchen door. Tom DUCKS behind the * kitchen island before Rat-Face can see him. * As Rat-Face skulks by the other side of the island, Tom drags * Grace across the floor to hide, but then sees: * He’s mopping the floor with her bloody wedding dress, leaving * a streaky trail. He’s out of options. * Rat-Face curiously walks over to the whirring meat-slicer. As * he does, he nearly trips over: * Grace on the floor in her wedding dress in a pool of blood. * Rat-Face looks back at the meat slicer. And the down again at * the bloody bride. What the hell happened? * He aims his gun and gives her a kick to see if she’s dead. * Grace stirs awake to see Rat-Face standing over her with the * barrel of his shotgun pointed at her. She looks around. * He’s gone. She’s going to die. Alone. Then Rat-Face GASPS, stiffens, and falls forward, landing inches from Grace with Carol’s cake knife IN HIS BACK. * Grace looks up and sees Tom standing over them with his * wounded hand in his white tuxedo jacket pocket stained red. He tries to act like he’s not about to pass out. Grace’s eyes water. So relieved. He helps her up, and even * though they’re not ziptied anymore, their hands linger. * This hits Grace. They hold eye contact, and then Tom looks * down at the dead pirate. He puts his shoe on the pirate’s * back and pulls the cake knife out. * Tom hands her the knife, curious. She cleans it off with a * towel, hikes her dress and slices through her suffocating * shape wear. She can finally breathe... It’s been hours. * She throws the shapewear at the buzzing meat slicer and it * rips into tatters. * Grace saws off the bottom two feet of her dress. Tom yanks * off the dead Pirate’s combat boots and passes them to Grace. * He looks through the pirate’s pockets and steals the walkie- * talkie. And then he finds something else: a paper invitation * to Tom and Grace’s wedding. Huh. That’s weird. * Tom turns around to see in the surreal sight of his fiancée: * Messy cropped hair, combat boots, a blood-streaked and * shredded wedding dress, holding Rat-Face’s shotgun. Grace * notices Tom gawking at her. * They hear a pirate coming and hurry out a back door just * missing the pirate pursuing them: Dog-Face. Out for blood. * They scan the area and see: a house tucked away behind the * pool. They rush inside. * They enter a charming home filled with plants, knick-knacks, * framed photos. Grace looks at one: it’s a photo of Marge. * They peek into a room to find Marge’s office. Tom rushes over * to the computer. * With his bloody hands, he clicks the mouse and checks the * connection. No luck. * ANGLE ON: Marge’s computer desktop, which is a collage of * Corgi pictures. She also has a Corgi mousepad and a coffee * mug shaped like a Corgi. * Grace peeks out the shutters to the jungle and sees Dog-Face * and Tiger-Face searching through the trees. * Suddenly a trap door in the floor CREAKS open below them. * Grace reels around to shoot but her gun is grabbed by-- * Marge! Holding one of Tom’s DIY mason jar lanterns. She holds a finger to her mouth like “Shhh.” Then waves them in. Grace and Tom descend into the dirt-walled panic room. There * are a few shovels and a tunnel. Ace flashes Tom a gold tooth smile. He’s holding a mason jar lantern and a shovel. Marge is desperate for information: Ace hands Tom the pill bottle. He shakes a few into his * mouth. Grace pops the gum and then rips a piece of gauzy lace * from her dress. *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 77. Tom extracts his bloody hand from his jacket. Grace takes a breath and gently cleans the wound. * Grace pulls a stretch of duct-tape with her teeth. Tom bites * his sleeve and Grace starts to tape up his hand. * Grace freezes, mid-duct-tape... *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 78. Grace looks to Tom but he’s staring up at the wooden * floorboards overhead. Avoiding eye contact. Grace squeezes his wounded hand -- pissed. Tom suppresses a * SCREAM. * Dog-Face hears noises coming from the house and heads over. * IN THE PANIC ROOM * This sets Grace off. Something is released in her: * That hangs in the air... Tom’s eyes are glassy. Grace doesn’t say it. But yeah. That’s what she means. * Suddenly they hear a DOOR OPEN and floorboards CREAK. * Dog-Face looks around the office and sees BLOOD on the * keyboard and the mouse. *  DOG-FACE * But then hears his own MUFFLED VOICE echo back to him. He * flips around, confused where the noise came from. * Tom turns down the volume of the stolen walkie-talkie. Then * holds his breath. They all do. Praying the guy didn’t notice. * Dog-Face is suspicious. He exits the office and opens a door * to a closet. Nothing. Clown-Face rushes inside the house. Dog- * Face holds up a finger to be silent. * Tom holds the walkie-talkie to his ear, on a much lower * volume. He hears Pirates talking but it’s not English. Tom hands the walkie to Ace, then looks into the tunnel. * Tom grabs a mason jar lantern for light, hunches down into the tunnel. It goes about twelve feet before dead-ending. * Shovels and planks of plywood sit against the dead end. * Grace grabs a shovel and gets to work. She’s still pissed at * him but this is life and death. Tom hands Marge his mason jar lantern and she heads into the tunnel with Grace. Ace has the walkie-talkie to his ear. * Tom’s baffled. But there’s no time. He hears the footsteps. * They’re distant. In the other room. He makes a decision. * He pushes the hatch above his head slightly open and peeks * out. No one there. Grace whispers at him, panicked. * Not listening, Tom hands Grace the shotgun and hoists himself * out of the hatch and closes it. * Tom pushes the heavy desk over the hatch so it can’t be re- * opened. He creeps into the living room and spots Dog-Face and * Clown-Face in the kitchen, with their backs to him. * They turn around and train their guns on him. * They stick their guns to his back aggressively and walk him * out of the house. * Grace’s ear is pressed up against the hatch. She hears them * march Tom out of the house. * Grace smiles, overwhelmed by what Tom did for her. She grabs * a shovel and starts shoveling with determination. * Tom is walked out to the pool by Dog-Face and Tiger-Face at * gunpoint. The hostages are shocked-- * The Pirate Leader walks up to Tom with a stapler in hand. Tom flinches, but the Leader just staples his name card to his * bloody tux jacket: “Groom” The guests react: What’s going on? * Tom nods to his duct-taped hand. Tom looks at Sean and in spite of everything, smiles. * Tom approaches the Pirate Leader and leans in to whisper so * only he can hear: * The Pirate Leader UZI-whips Tom’s jaw. Ouch. Then throws him into the pool with the rest of the hostages. Tom adjusts his jacket but we see he’s actually pulled the tattered floral boutonniere from his lapel. Up to something. Tom puts an arm around Sean’s shoulder to support himself in the water. But it was a trap! Tom gets Sean in a choke-hold, and holds the sharp pin of the boutonniere an inch from Sean’s eye. Tom strains to hold Sean. Sean stops struggling and goes cross-eyed staring at the needle an inch from his eye. Panicked. All the guests SCREAM at Tom. The Pirates aim their guns at him, alarmed and confused. The guests (and some pirate) trade looks: he sounds jealous. * Everyone waits for something dramatic to happen but nothing * does. Tom, still holding Sean, whispers to Ricky. * Ricky grabs a paper sticking out of Tom’s front pocket: Tom * and Grace’s wedding invitation. * Ricky opens invitation and the RSVP card falls out. * Ricky triumphantly holds it up. Now Tom is back in his mode. * Robert is scowling at Sean. He looks around the pool, looking * for an ally. Everyone stares at him, horrified. * Sean HEADBUTTS Tom, breaking out of the chokehold. The * hostages GASP and SCREAM. * Pirates haul Tom out of the pool and train their guns on him. * Sean wades out and Dog-Face hands him a towel to dry off. * A hush falls over the hostages, stunned by the revelation. * Grace digs with a fury. Ace spreads the dirt out as they go. * Marge lights the way with a mason jar lantern. * Grace glances back at the lantern. For some reason this * compliment makes Grace cry. * Grace’s surprised. She takes a break from digging, hands the * shovel to Ace. Wipes the sweat and dirt off her face. Grace takes this in. * Tom sits in a pool chair as the Pirate Leader holds a gun to * his head. Sean watches. The Pirate Leader clocks him with the back of his gun. Then Tom sees... twenty feet away... a sinkhole forming. Oh * shit. It’s Grace digging. She’s gonna pop out in plain view. * Sean studies a stoic Tom: Does he believe him? * Tom looks over to Carol, who silently mouths “Good one.” * Impressed by his lie. He smiles. * The Pirate Leader narrows his eyes at Sean, angry. Sean scans * the hostages in the pool and lands on one. * Clown-Face grabs Harriett from the pool. * Clown-Face hauls Harriett away. The Pirate Leader follows. * Sean turns back to Robert. * Sean climbs into the helicopter and it takes off. The sound * is deafening. Wind blows Tom’s hair back... makes waves in * the crowded pool... Tiger-Face and Dog-Face stay behind to guard the hostages. * Suddenly, they hear a SCRAPING NOISE, turn, and see a shovel * stab out of the grass-- Grace crawls out of the earth in a dirt-covered, ripped, and * bloody wedding dress. Brandishing a shotgun. *  the middle of a fight, Tom! She squints into the blinding sunlight, trying to find Tom. The pirates point their guns at her, and she points her gun * at them. It’s a stand-off. She looks strong, confident. She’s almost unrecognizable, in an awesome way.  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 92. She brandishes the gun. It goes off, grazing Jamie’s ear. Grace waves the gun around wildly. * Tom can’t help smiling. It’s crazy, but cool. Grace waves the gun in their direction and then realizes: * Grace smiles, satisfied. * Grace squints to see pirates heading toward her, guns aimed. * She drops her gun and Dog-Face grabs her by the hair. * Dog-Face unceremoniously SHOVES Grace in the pool. She lands * next to Tom. Now out of the sun, Grace takes in the scene. * Dog-Face pulls Marge and Ace out of the hole, as he talks * into his walkie-talkie. The walkie-talkie clipped onto the Pirate’s Leader’s bullet proof vest can’t be heard over the ENGINE. The Pirate Leader is clipped in, hanging out the open door with a machine gun, eyes peeled for Grace in a golf cart. * Sean has his arm around a frightened-looking Harriett’s neck. * BACK TO SCENE: Tom finishes catching Grace up. * They beam at each other. The other hostages don’t get why. * Grace gestures to the pirates guarding the pool with guns. * Everyone turns to Larry, the quietest man at the wedding, * taking his video camera out of a plastic waterproof pouch * around his neck. * Larry turns on his camera as Grace, Tom, Renee, Robert and * Carol huddle around to watch. * Larry films Carol dancing on her own, trying to get Renee to * join in. He PANS OVER TO the beach where Sean and Harriett * are chatting, away from the crowd, on the sand. * Sean kisses Harriett. * The kissing intensifies. Harriett grabs Sean’s butt. * Robert stares off into space, stunned by the betrayal. * Renee looks at Robert, dying to say something. Robert is surprised by her grace in that moment. He nods. Sean stands by the Pirate Leader, arm still around Harriett. * But this time, she’s kissing his arm tenderly. * The Pirate Leader looks through binoculars. * They look down and see a wrecked resort golf cart on the ocean rocks, waves SMASHING AGAINST IT. It’s the one Grace and Tom were ziptied too. But they don’t * know that. Sean processes this for a beat.  DEBTS TEN FOLD. SO FAR ALL IT’S  DONE IS KILLED FOUR GOOD MEN.  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 98.  THE MONEY AND YOU WALK AWAY WITH * Harriett gently puts her arms around Sean. * In one swift motion, Harriett UNHOOKS the Pirate Leader from * his clip and KICKS him out of the helicopter. He plummets to * his death. She holds her gun on Clown-Face. * Harriett turns, wild-eyed. Sean is clearly afraid of her. * Grace and Tom whisper to each other. *  DOG-FACE *  NO WHISPERS! OR I THROW GRENADE IN *  THE POOL! * Tom and Grace eye the grenade hanging off his belt and glance * at each other, knowingly. They have to get the grenade. *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 99. The guests are confused and scared but they go along with it. * Grace smiles at her dad. Robert takes her arm and walks down * the “aisle” towards Tom at the shallow end. Grace looks at * Marge, signaling with her eyes toward Dog-Face. She nods. * Grace looks at Tom. For a second, they get lost in this * moment. A bride walking down the aisle to her groom. Grace * lands at the “altar,” next to Tom. Holding hands. * Jeannie, terrified, shakes her head. She’s too scared. Everyone turns to see Carol, singing Etta James’ “At Last” * with utter commitment. * Inspired by her courage, Renee joins her. * Grace and Tom can’t believe it. Everyone is finally united. * Even Tiger-Face wipes a tear from his eye. * Grace, Tom and Marge look at each other and NOD. Together * they RUSH the two pirates: * -Tom KICKS a stunned Tiger-Face in the stomach. * -Marge pulls an impressive KRAV-MAGA-style Elbow Strike on * Dog Face, knocking him down. * -Grace yanks at Dog-Face’s belt as he scrambles for his gun. * -Tiger-Face scrambles back up and grabs his gun. * -Dog-Face gets his gun and flips around, aiming it at Grace. * The hostages look on, breathless. Terrified. * Then Dog-Face sees Grace is holding one of his grenades. She * spits the grenade’s pin into the dirt. Smiling. The Pirates look like they’re regretting the choices that led * them to this moment. Tiger-Face immediately drops his gun and puts his hands up. * Dog-Face doesn’t want to back down. Not again. Suddenly he * sprints down to the lawn below the pool. * As Ace cuffs Tiger-Face with his own zipties, a bullet flies * past Grace. Dog-Face is SHOOTING AT GRACE from the lawn. * The guests in the pool duck. Some go under water. Bullets * whiz through the air. * ON LARRY, shielding Scotty in the pool. A bullet flies past * Larry, grazing his arm. He yelps. * ON RENEE, cowering as BANG! Someone next to her returns fire * at Dog-Face. She turns to see: * CAROL, out of the pool, behind a lounge chair, holding * Grace’s shotgun like a badass. She fires again, shouting. * Renee stares, stunned. Impressed. * ON GRACE and TOM, huddled behind a chair. She looks at the * grenade in her hand. * Tom grabs a DECORATIVE STATUE nearby, wielding it like a bat. * ON THE LAWN, Dog-Face ducks behind a TABLE for cover. Then * peeks to see: * Tom standing, curiously armed with nothing but a statue-- * Suddenly Grace tosses a grenade straight up... * TOM SWINGS HIS TABLE LEG LIKE A BAT AND NAILS IT-- * The grenade flies straight toward Dog-Face hitting the * table... which happens to be the FIREWORKS STAND. * It EXPLODES! A GEYSER OF BLOOD ERUPTS and the FIREWORKS SHOOT * IN THE SKY in every direction. It’s SPECTACULAR. * All the guests peek to watch, momentarily mesmerized by the * fireworks. They break out into WILD APPLAUSE AND CHEERS. * Scotty’s jaw is on the floor, having just witnessed his uncle * doing the single most badass thing that’s ever happened. * Grace laughs. Proud. But there’s no time to celebrate. They * see the helicopter in the distance, headed back this way. * Ace, guarding Tiger-Face, spots KEYS around his neck. * As the fireworks shoot overhead, the guests help each other * out of the pool, as Ace leads the way. * ANGLE ON Carol, handing Renee a towel as they go. * ANGLE ON Ricky, helping Jamie out of the pool. *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 103. ANGLE ON Larry and Robert unintentionally side by side. * BACK ON ACE, using the keys to unlock.. THE SPA * The guests follow Ace into a gorgeous one-room spa, full of * all the RESORT WORKERS... Eager for news. ON RENEE, taking in the spa. * ON LARRY, already grabbing a terrycloth robe from a rack. * Harriett looks through binoculars at the fireworks, the * smoldering lawn, the guests being ushered into the spa... * She screams in frustration, throwing the binoculars at Sean. * Sean tries to kiss her but she pulls away, clearly annoyed. * Grace, Tom and Marge usher the final guests into the spa. The * sound from the approaching helicopter gets louder. * Tom nods and goes to close the door but Carol stops him. * Carol cocks her shotgun. * Tom pushes the door shut. Grace wraps the chain around the * handle and snaps the padlock shut again. Slips the lanyard key in Tom’s jacket pocket. Grace hikes her wedding dress up her thigh, revealing her * garter belt. She slides the cake knife in it to hold it on her thigh, like she’s fucking Rambo in a wedding dress. Tom straps Tiger-Face’s Uzi to his arm, preparing for the big * showdown. * The sound of the HELICOPTER LANDING is deafening. They turn * to see the helicopter has just touched down 100 yards away. * Tom and Grace lock eyes with Sean and Harriett for a second * and then break into a SPRINT down the trail to the dock. Sean * runs after them, in pursuit. * SLO-MO SEQUENCE: Etta James’ original “AT LAST” plays as... * Tom and Grace run for their lives down a trail to the docks. * Sean chases them, shooting warning shots in their direction. * Tom and Grace duck and dodge bullets. They hop over rocks and * logs. Grace trips but Tom catches her before she can fall. * Sean gains on them and finally catches up to them. He GRABS * Grace by the arm as we... * Grace turns to look at Sean with fiery anger. * Grace SHOVES Sean off the trail. He TUMBLES down rocks and * falls hard. Tom keeps running, but laughs, satisfied. * Lizard-Face sits on the dock, “guarding it,” gun on his lap, * headphones on, playing a game on his phone. He is unaware of * anything that transpired today. * Suddenly, the barrel of an Uzi is in Lizard-Face’s ... face. * He stands up, dropping everything, with his hands up. *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 106. Grace whips out a pair of zipties and ties him to the dock. * As she finishes, BANG! BANG! They spins to see Sean, banged * up and pissed, up the trail running toward them. * They duck for cover behind the Amanpulo Island Resort sign. * BANG! BANG! BANG! A bullet clip the side of the sign. * Tom points to the one covered by a tarp. Tom SHOOTS back at * Sean, forcing Sean to duck behind a palm tree. * Grace runs and rips the tarp off, revealing-- * The gorgeous 1973 Riva Aquarama speedboat decked out in white streamers with “Just Married” spelled out in wooden letters. She freezes. Stunned. Or maybe just dazed from blood loss. Grace snaps out of it, saws through the anchor-rope with the * cake knife and climbs aboard. She starts the motor, opens up the throttle and pulls away from the dock. Tom runs and jumps onto the back just in time! They speed off... dragging the “Just Married” buoys in their wake like tin cans. Sean climbs onto a resort speedboat with a huge engine and a tow-line on the back for parasailing. He starts the engine up and it ROARS to life, so fast the nose shoots up out of the water... IN THE “JUST MARRIED” BOAT, Turquoise water turns dark blue as they get into open ocean. They just have to get to the marina on the horizon! But Sean’s parasailing boat is catching up. As Grace guns the engine she sees the picnic basket and the * champagne bottle floating in a bucket of melted ice. Tom smiles at her sadly. Grace stares at him, moved. * BANG! BANG! BANG! Sean shoots at their boat. Tom and Grace * DUCK as he keeps talking. * Grace SHARPLY TURNS THE BOAT to try and get away from Sean. * It works for a moment-- Sean is forced to change directions. BANG. A bullet hits the boat. Sean is on their tail again. * Tom shoots, as Grace speeds up the boat. * MORE GUNFIRE FROM SEAN, then the gunfire stops. Tom leans over the back of the boat and SPRAYS RETURN FIRE until-- CLICK CLICK. * Suddenly, Sean’s boat pulls side by side. He drives the boat with one hand, in a dripping wet tux. Still cool as hell. Tom grabs the champagne bottle POPS THE CORK. BLASTING IT RIGHT into Sean’s eyes! Sean shakes it off, barely phased. Sean is hit with ICE from Tom’s ice bucket. Tom then throws * the actual ice bucket. It bounces off his head. Now truly desperate, Tom opens the picnic basket and pegs * fruit at Sean’s head: strawberries, oranges, bananas. * Tom NAILS Sean in the head with a coconut. Sean winces and * grabs a jug of gasoline and hurls it into Tom and Grace’s * boat. It spills all over the deck. Sean aims a flare gun-- OH SHIT. Tom leaps into Sean’s boat! * Tom tries to wrestle the flare gun away from Sean. Sean knees Tom in the stomach and pistol-whips him-- Sean then whips his boat around, steering back towards the resort. He knows Grace will follow ‘cause he’s got Tom. * But Grace follows. The chase is flipped! * Tom gets a lucky blow and knocks the flare gun out of Sean’s hands. It skitters across the deck. Sean dives for it. Sean turns to aim but sees a parasailing harness fall around * his neck like a noose. What the fuck? Tom sees a SMALL LEVER at the back of the boat and hurls an * orange at it -- causing the chute to unfurl into the wind! * Sean is yanked up into the air but grabs Tom! The parachute pops wide open behind the boat, ripping them both 50 feet into the air-- --dangling helpless as they’re pulled by the driverless, speeding boat. On a crash course with the resort island. IN THE PURSUING SPEED BOAT, Grace can’t believe her eyes: * The giant parachute is a big yellow smiley-face. Below it * Sean dangles, with Tom grabbing onto him. * Grace speeds to catch up with them... * MEANWHILE, Underneath that incongruous smiley face parachute, Tom grips * onto Sean for dear life. No harness. Scared but determined. * Tom’s eyes flick down at the water below. If Sean drops him, * he’d hit the water like concrete. Tom’s got nothing left. So hurt. So tired. Tom claws on tight to Sean as he sees Grace’s boat pulling * beside Sean’s, trying to rescue him. Sean’s boat is a hundred * feet from smashing into the rocky coast of the island. Grace bumps her boat into Sean’s, trying to push it away from * its collision course. No dice. She stands on the seat, jams * the throttle, and rips the cake knife from her dress. * She’ll need it to jump to the other boat. She leaps!! * PARASAILING BOAT --and lands in this boat. Then grabs the controls and steers them back towards the marina of the next island. She sees the flaming “Just Married” boat she ditched CAREEN ASHORE Amanpulo island... ...blasting through the rows of white chairs and crashing into rocks in an FIERY EXPLOSION. UP IN THE PARACHUTE, Tom saw the explosion too. Then sees Grace steering them toward the mainland. He’s proud of her... * Until he turns and sees that Sean is grinning. Tom follows his gaze and sees Sean’s helicopter flying up over the treeline. Harriett. Coming after them. Fuck! * IN THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER, Harriett hangs off the side. With wild hair, crazed eyes, and * an Uzi strapped to her: she looks scary as hell. * IN THE PARACHUTE, Tom takes in Harriett. * Tom looks down at Grace in the boat. Unarmed. Helpless. * Tom sees the chopper’s menacing shadow appear in the translucent parachute... Fifty feet above him... Harriett OPENS FIRE ON GRACE’S BOAT! Her view is obstructed * by the parachute, but she hits the fuel tank, spilling oil * from the back of the boat. CLOSE ON Grace, realizing that they are finished. * Then she smiles a little, looks up at Tom, and says, quietly: Tom locks eyes with Grace-- then looks at down the rope to * the boat—- then looks down at the water. He gets an idea and * reaches in his pocket to grab... Grace’s hair extensions. * ON GRACE, looking up at Tom, realizing what he’s about to do. * ON TOM, putting the hair extensions over the taut cord... * And lets go of Sean to zip-line down! * He zooms down and STICKS the landing. Like Grace’s superhero * landing before. She smiles, impressed and overwhelmed when-- * BULLETS PIERCE ALL AROUND THEM. Tom grabs a MACHETE and * slices through the rope... * ...sending Sean’s parachute hurtling high into the sky... ...right into the blades of the helicopter. We hear the BLADES CHEW THROUGH SEAN... SNAP THE ROPE and then CHOKE on the parachute... Grace dives to shield Tom as-- * THE HELICOPTER VEERS WILDLY, CRASHES INTO THE WATER, AND EXPLODES! Tom and Grace lie on the back of the boat in each others’ * arms. They can’t believe they’re alive. The engine is kaput, but the boat bobs in the waves... floating back towards the resort island. The parasailing boat sits in the sand like a beached whale... near the destroyed white rented chairs and the burned wreckage of the “Just Married” boat. Splatters of oil on the sand are still burning from the explosion. Tom hobbles as Grace helps him to the beach. * They look at each other for a beat, then: * Tom is heartbroken for a moment, until he sees Grace pushing * her broken body into a kneeling position. Tom grins. So in love with this blood-spattered woman. With bloody hands, Tom passes Grace her engagement ring. She * holds it up to him. * Tom smiles, fighting back tears. * Grace slides the diamond ring onto Tom’s finger. Or tries to. * It doesn’t fit. They laugh, overwhelmed and delirious. * Grace smiles as Tom puts the ring on her finger. Again. A * tender, quiet moment. * They kiss and turn toward the horizon just as a SCHOOL OF * WHALES crests in the ocean. They watch, astounded. * They laugh and Grace lies down with Tom. *  Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 115. Grace pushes him back onto the sand gently as they make out. * He hikes up her tattered wedding dress as MUSIC SWELLS. The wedding guests and resort staff are all intermingling in * bathrobes. Many in face masks. Drinking cucumber water. * Ricky is giving Jamie a massage. Larry is giving Carol a * pedicure. As hostage situations go, this one isn’t bad. * Everyone hears the DOOR CREAKING OPEN and see... Tom and * Grace silhouetted at the door. * Everyone cheers and rushes them. Everyone sits on the sand together. Tom and Grace have that * blissed out energy of two people who had spontaneous sex right before hosting a dinner party. They’re calm and smiling and holding hands as they fill everyone in on what happened.  ...and then the helicopter  exploded. * Tom and Grace look over at Marge. She smiles. * Her soon-to-be nephew Scotty looks up, ready to help. * As the last sliver of sun sits on the horizon and coast guard boats descend on the island... Grace and Tom stand under the threshold decorated with wilted * flowers. Their clothes are ripped and stained with blood . She’s still wearing combat boots. They make quite the pair. Some guests sit in the white rental chairs. Some sit on the front of the beached parasailing boat. Some in the sand. Marge officiates but we just hear MUSIC. The Coast Guard land on the beach. They approach but Jamie * turns and holds a finger up. So the Coast Guard Guys watch the makeshift wedding ceremony, confounded. Scotty brings something over to Tom and Grace. He opens his * palms to reveal: two grenade pins with metal rings. They slide them on each other’s fingers and kiss. The guests clap and so do the confused Coast Guard guys. Then BANG!! Everyone jolts, scared, but then see-- It’s just * Ricky lighting off one final firework. * Carol and Larry carry over what’s left of the wedding cake. Tom and Grace take a moment to stand back and watch everyone: * Ricky and Jamie flirt over handfuls of cake. Grace’s parents * have a heart to heart with their bare feet in the sand. Ace and Marge hold each other, watching the sunset.  I finally get it. Tom smiles. It means a lot to hear her say that. That hangs in the air for a second before-- Grace hugs him. Husband and wife. Til death do they part. * From the POV of Larry’s Video Camera: We see moments from * later in the night after a few (at lot) of drinks. * -Ricky gives his speech, Jamie cracks up at every joke. * Clearly falling in love. * -Tom and Darcy have their first dance. It’s a little clunky * since Tom’s ankle is likely broken. They laugh through it. * -The HOUSE BAND -- with ACE as the lead singer -- plays an * American pop song in Filipino. Ace is very good. Tom smiles * at Marge, grateful. * -Carol jumps on stage with the band and sings. The crowd goes * WILD. Renee dances in the front like a groupie. * -Jeannie drunkenly makes out with a caterer. * -The MOMS-IN-LAW convince the DADS-IN-LAW to all jump in the * pool. They do and immediately regret it since it’s freezing. * -The whole wedding party does KARAOKE, all singing parts of * the same song. Even Larry puts the camera down and jumps in. *
