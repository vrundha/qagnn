Based on the game by Gearbox Tony Rettenmaier & Juel Taylor  Even for a place as vast and unpopulated as deep space, this  particular area seems like East Bumblefuck. No ships fly by,  no fancy planets with those ooh-ahh CGI rings...  Nope. Nothing. Nothing but the same zillion boring stars you  always see in the opening of one of these-- hold on... wait.  Some of the stars SHIFT, and we realize that in the center of  the screen, in a long vertical strip, those blinky lights  weren't stars but ACTUAL BLINKY LIGHTS...  TITLE: GERAKI SYSTEM, OUTER REACH  The STRUCTURE is slowly TURNING, revealing that we were  looking sideways at something quite massive. A SPACE STATION,  brutish and foreboding.  And as it rotates further, we see now that the entire station  is in the shape of an enormous A.  TITLE: PROUDLY OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE ATLAS CORPORATION  HAIR. Greasy, unkempt hair hanging down in front of a face we  can barely make out. Just an eye. Man? Woman? A water drop  hits the prisoner's face, not sure if it's water torture or  bad plumbing.  REVEAL: the PRISONER SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR by ANTI-GRAV CUFFS  around the wrists. Jesus pose. Wearing a particularly  unflattering ATLAS INMATE GARMENT.  This is LILITH, 40. It's clear from her hair, her skin... but  mostly the way she just hangs there without panic or anger...  that she's been here for a LONG TIME.  On her RIGHT FOREARM, a TATTOO. A simple shape of an ARCH,  like an upside-down U. Or V. She stares at it. Remembering to  remember something. Or perhaps someone. And then, before we  hear or see anything, her EYES SHIFT quickly, full alert.  We hear the metallic clanking of robot GUARDS approaching,  followed by an electronic keypad, then a loud BUZZ.  ROBOT GUARD (O.S.)  The cuffs release, and Lilith drops, landing on the ground.  She looks up through blurry eyes and sees two sad looking  Atlas-branded robots. One looks like a garbage can with an  eyeball on a wiry, metal stick.  The robots help her stand. It's clear she has been dangling  there for a while.  Lilith walks, hands in Atlas-branded HANDCUFFS.  A large digital sign reads "No Rest for the Wicked."  They pass prisoners in their cells. Lilith makes eye contact  with ATHENA, 30s, who holds her arm in a high-tech torture  device in the wall, gritting her teeth in pain. Athena wears  a headband that collects sweat and drains it into tubes which  feed into the floor. A digital display ticks days off her  9,374 day sentence. Athena, unable to take any more, pulls  her arm out and drops to the floor.  technology...  We follow the tubes down below, where the sweat drains into  an Atlas-branded 'Fluid Fuel' box, which pumps fluid below  into a  Shower underneath where a gross looking prisoner washes. The  shower water drains into a cell below.  where a chef cooks a disgusting stew in a crockpot with skag  by-products. An endless "ecosystem" of recycled fluids.  A door SLIDES OPEN with a hiss. Lilith is nudged into the  room by the Mantis robot with a little BZZT. Before she can  turn around the door closes behind her. Her cuffs pop off. She SQUINTS because it's absurdly bright in here. Yes, from the lights over head, but also... almost everything is white. White floors, white desk, white walls. There's a chair for her at the table. Large windows show the star field outside. And on the other side of the desk... A MAN. Dressed to match the room. Perfectly dapper. He "flips" through the pages of a HOLOGRAPHIC INMATE FILE. His right hand is cybernetic. Designed to be appreciated. And yes, the file says ATLAS on it. So does the wall behind his head. And another one. "ATLAS... At last." He goes back to her file. In the images, holographic footage of Lilith breaking into various places, taken from surveillance cameras. We see images of items now. Statues, gems, metallic bricks, computer chips... Something menacing in his voice there. Lilith tenses ever so slightly. The Man notices. Almost delighted by it. And now he leans back, self-satisfied. And waits. Waits right there in his seat, right under the word ATLAS. Lilith looks at him. At the word. At him. Oh. Holy shit. He's-- He removes a PHOTO from his jacket, and hands it to Lilith. Lilith looks at the photo. It's of a YOUNG GIRL, maybe 12. Sweet and innocent-looking. But a hint of sadness too. She plays around in the picture, seemingly from a happier time. Atlas says this with a 'Don't fuck with me' tone. Lilith drops the badass prisoner posture. A little. Atlas pulls out an apple. Lilith looks at it like she hasn't seen one in a long time. Maybe ever.  CHOMP. He flips through her file again. We see images of  Lilith's exploits. Demolished walls, bullet holes....  Atlas tosses the one-bite apple into a little blue buzzing  light. The apple disintegrates with a BZZT. Get the message?  We're in a DOCKING CHAMBER, a suspended BRIDGE leads to the  hull of a JUMPSHIP. Atlas waits for Lilith outside a door.  The door opens and Lilith steps out in her classic  Borderlands Lilith outfit. She spins and holsters her old  looking (but hi-tech to us) VLADOFF INFINITY PISTOL.. Atlas hands her a small black Atlas-branded communicator with one button on it. They arrive at the ship. He turns to her. Quite serious. He gestures to the ship. She steps on, then turns back. Remembering to ask the most obvious question of all. PANIC in Lilith's eyes. She makes a motion to the door...  WOOSH--WHAMMM. The doors SLIDE SHUT, trapping her inside. The  ship is RELEASED from its moorings, and we're--  A small vessel with an autopilot, designed to carry just a  few people. In this case, one very, very, very angry--  The ship accelerates, and she falls backwards. Really should  have gotten into a seat before--  --the ship ACCELERATES into space, hurtling away from us  until the glow of its engines disappears among the stars.  The sun-- wait, that's a diamond-ish covered moon?--  whatever... the BRIGHT THING IN THE SKY is shining down on  the BAKED, PARCHED GROUND. Not a sound, other than the  whistle of a HOT WIND, and the rusty whine of--  THE DERELICT SPACEPORT - maybe it was nice back in its day,  but on this day, it's a piece of shit. And then... THE ATLAS  JUMPSHIP roars into view, circles around, hovering over what  was once a landing pad, but is now metal poles with scraps of  wood.  The DOOR OPENS, revealing a VERY PISSED OFF Lilith. She  shields her eyes from the glare.  With that, the ship begins TILTING--  Have a pleasant trip.  An AIR BLAST SHOOTS from the ship, sending Lilith to the  ground.  She lands on the rocky dirt with a THUD, a beat later an  Atlas PACK drops next to her, nearly hitting her head.  She breathes a sigh of annoyance, and then an ATLAS  INFLATABLE SAFETY RAFT LANDS ON HER. Lilith looks up and  fires off a torrent of NSFW words, none of which we can hear  as the jump ship takes off.  Lilith looks out toward the horizon. In the far distance, a  MURKY HAZE... some massive area blanketed in an evil vapor.  Then... a CREAKING NOISE. Lilith turns and sees...  A LARGE BILLBOARD, meant to welcome visitors in some long  ago, far happier time. A painting of a MOTHER holding her  LITTLE DAUGHTER as they both look off into the distance,  smiling, as if welcoming some bright, beautiful tomorrow.  It reads: Welcome to Pandora! The NEXT paradise planet! Well,  it mostly says that. A bunch of the rusting panels have  fallen off. It's decaying and riddled with BULLET HOLES.  Lilith stares at the little girl's face. So happy, so hopeful.  With her shot-out eyes and sniper-rifled teeth. Across her  face, someone has SPRAY-PAINTED: WHAT'S IN THE VAULT?  Lilith stares at the mother and girl, remember something...  FLASH: The same spot, years earlier. A ship taking off - a  little girl crying - screaming for her mother -  A GROWL. Unseen by Lilith, a LONE SKAG creeps up behind her.  An ugly hyena-sized creature, it opens back its face, all  teeth, preparing to charge its unsuspecting prey...  Lilith stares at the sign, lost in a memory, the girl  screaming for her mother...the sound of the ship leaving -  Suddenly - CRASH! The sign is OBLITERATED by a RAIDER TRUCK  SMASHING THROUGH, coming right at Lilith, snapping her out of  her memory... Lilith DUCKS out of the way... The truck hits  the ground and slams into the Skag.  Lilith leaps through the hole in the sign, taking cover.  The truck roars and spins back, PSYCHO RAIDERS all over it...  They whoop and holler with animalistic cries. The raiders  floor it - charging right back towards Lilith.  Lilith readies her Vladof, when the COMMUNICATOR CHIRPS.  Atlas continues talking as if nothing she said matters. The  Raider truck speeds closer... Lilith scans the landscape, and  sees an old corroded chemical barrel labeled FLAMMABLE.  The Psychos shoot at Lilith, tearing up the picture of the  little girl in the sign. Lilith spins around and FIRES,  hitting the barrel as the Psychos drive past it!  BOOM! The barrel blows, flipping the Raider Truck ON ITS  SIDE, SKIDDING FULL SPEED ACROSS THE DIRT. The Psychos  scream, only now it's not out of fun... The driver steers  helplessly as they skid towards a giant hole in the ground...  The Truck tumbles into the deep hole...a SKAG DEN. It's like  falling into an alligator pit, only less friendly.  Lilith walks up to the hole, as we hear the chomping and  growling of skags eating what's left of the Psychos.  The Skag that truck hit is still alive, dragging itself  towards Lilith with its front paws. Lilith sees one last  Psycho crawling up the wall of the pit. She raises her gun.  Suddenly, the Skag leaps - past Lilith - onto the psycho with  a chomp to the face! They both fall to the bottom of the pit.  BZZZT. End of communication. Lilith throws her pack over her  shoulder and takes a step into the horizon when - BOOM BOOM  BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM... The title "BORDERLANDS" drops out  out of the sky, settling in the dust like the Hollywood sign.  Lilith shakes her head, walking on.  We hear THE SOUND OF AN APPROACHING VEHICLE. Oh god, more?  Nope... this is just a kitbashed old TRANSPORT BUS. It pulls  to a stop, and the DOOR opens with a HISS. The driver is  MARCUS. Stocky, 50, circle beard on his face, and a twinkle  in his eye. He speaks with an odd accent.  Lilith looks around. Spot fires, monster guts, and debris  scattered around her. Yeah. She needs a ride.  Marcus drives along, cheery. Checks his mirror to see LILITH,  his only passenger. Grabs a microphone. Feedback! SQUEEWEEW!  Marcus pushes a button. A small video screen protected by a  cage on the back of the seat in front of her starts up. ON  VIDEO SCREEN - a corny fanfare, and a strangely retro WELCOME  video begins to play over ANIMATED IMAGES.  "A Magic Marcus production..."  THIS OFF PLEASE.  Marcus mouths along with the words, excitedly watching her  reaction in the rear view mirror.  OUTSIDE - a skag takes a shit in the middle of the road  before getting its shit pushed in by the bus’ all-terrain  tires. Paradise, indeed.  BACK ON THE SCREEN - footage of ERIDEAN RELIEFS depicting  angelic humanoid beings.  Lilith pulls out her Vladof. Aims for the screen.  Footage of a HYPERION SHIP landing dead on top of an idyllic  FARMING HOMESTEAD. Killing all inside.  Lilith KICKS at the SECURITY CAGE. It doesn't budge.  Lilith KICKS AND KICKS at the monitor. Marcus looks in the  mirror, getting a little concerned.  Her angry boot finally breaks through the cage, cracking the  monitor. BZZT. The buzz sends the whole system on the fritz.  The video glitches and garbles on all the monitors.  Marcus, panicked, hits a control panel. A string of old video  tape spills out of a slot like spaghetti. Marcus stops the  bus, aghast.  Lilith stands outside the bus, tail between her legs. Marcus  screams at her from the driver's seat.  Marcus drives off. She knows he's not wrong, she doesn't even  put up a fight. The bus hits a POTHOLE in the road, bumping,  sending her pack off the roof and to the ground.  Lilith picks it up, dusts it off, and throws it over her  shoulder and starts walking into the desolate landscape.  But she's not alone... A POV from far, far away watches her  through binoculars as she navigates the hostile terrain.  Lilith walks past broken down, shot-up faded signs from DAHL  and HYPERION. Vandalized on them by different hands: "VAULT  OR DIE" "IT AIN'T HERE" and "NOT MY VAULT!"  A few wanted posters for scary looking criminals hang on  posts, blowing in the wind. One poster stands out: a serious  looking soldier in a Crimson Lance uniform. ROLAND. Wanted:  $100,000 alive. $10,000 Head only. $17,500 Head with  shoulders attached.  Sitting on the post above the poster she sees a doll: a  headless bunny. Odd... She pulls the doll off the sign,  examines the string on its back, then slips it in her bag.  Lilith talks with a few poor civilians, who live in the  remains of old Dahl and Hyperion ships. She shows the photo,  they shake their heads and go back inside, unable to help.  A scrap metal and garbage pile in the middle of nowhere, and  the foot of a giant, towering statue of some evil warlord.  Lilith approaches the statue with trepidation: a Psycho  warrior in a spiked steel battle suit, with a horned mask, a  giant machete in hand. A terrifying vision, meant to warn  anyone who enters these lands. Below it written ALL HAIL  KROM. Suddenly, the statue bellows in a loud, crackled, pre-  recorded voice:  Lilith remembers something terrible. A voice comes into her  head. The same voice, blending with the recorded one.  FLASH: Continuation of what we saw earlier. A LITTLE GIRL -  REACHING FOR HER MOTHER - SCREAMING. DUST, WIND, CHAOS. A  SHIP TAKING OFF... And then KROM- POINTING A CANNON FROM A  TURRET AT HER MOTHER.  Lilith realizes she's activating a speaker by standing on a  small piece of metal. She takes her foot off. It stops.  She hears some rustling noise and turns to the scrap pile.  Someone, or something, is under there. She pulls her gun,  ready, when a child, about 10, pops up with up a rusty  weapon. A few other kids scramble out, admiring the find.  The child is about to fire the gun, when Lilith grabs the  kid's hand. The kid looks surprised.  Lilith tosses the old gun up and SHOOTS it like a skeet. The  gun EXPLODES, much to the kids delight.  She turns, and sees the kids are GONE. Hiding in the scrap.  Lilith takes out a large Atlas CHOCOLATE BAR from her pack.  Just hearing the unwrapping noise and the kids jump out.  Lilith shows them the photo of Allara. The kids look at each  other, a knowing look between them.  The kids lead Lilith up a rocky path, over a boulder field.  They all climb with fairly natural instincts for the rocks.  They reach an opening in the rocks, small enough for a child  to fit through.  Lilith squeezes her pack in, and then slips into the hole  feet first. We see she has total control over her body. She  twists, turns, and fits in. Now we get a sense of how she got  in and out of places as a thief.  Lilith stands in the cramped corridor in the rock. A small  light at the end of the corridor. She takes a step, but her  bag wedges in the rock. She leaves it in the wedge.  Lilith's voice echoes through the cave.  At the very end, she sees a large (large for a child) room,  with a small girl standing by a fire. The fire illuminates a  huge drawing the girl's scratched in the rock with a tool.  In the illustration, a winged half-bird/half-human hovers  over the ground, in a protective bubble, shooting fire from  its hands at psychos below. The girl senses Lilith's  presence, but keeps drawing, never turning around.  Lilith holds up the picture. The girl stops drawing.  The girl turns around. She's BLIND. Her EYES HAVE BEEN  SCRATCHED. Covered with bandages, crudely taped.  Lilith stumbles back. It's definitely not Allara.  Lilith exits cave to find the kids, and her pack - gone.  Lilith sits by a campfire near some rocks. A small rodent-  like CREATURE scurries by. Lilith PINS it with a knife.  Lilith roasts the rodent creature on the stick. It looks  about as tasty as rodent on a stick sounds.  Off in the distance, we hear Krom's Psychos attack. We don't  know who they're attacking, we just hear the victim's screams  and the roar of their vehicles. "ALL HAIL KROM" echoes.  A large SHADOW GROWS behind Lilith. A CREATURE APPROACHING  BEHIND HER... Lilith instinctively turns and FIRES -  We hear a METALLIC-VOICED SCREAM, and then a loud CLATTER as  something hits the ground.  It RISES UP from the rock pile it landed in, and now we see  it. Looks like a trashcan balancing on one wheel with two  spindly arms waving about and--  The robot has TURNED around to face forward, revealing its  shot-at but perfectly fine ROUND, LIT-UP EYE. Lilith cringes. It really is grating. She SHOOTS the robot in the eye AGAIN. He goes flying, and lands in a heap. Gun at his eye. This gets Lilith's attention. She lowers the gun.  Lilith holds the photo of Allara in front of Claptrap. A  SCANNING BEAM emits from his eye, moving over it.  He rocks back and forth rhythmically as he sings a song.  From high atop a cliff, Lilith and Claptrap peek over the  rocks, looking down on a Canyon. Psychos race around in  Outrunners near the entrance. The place is crawling with  them. Then her skin goes cold as she reads KROM'S CANYON,  written in bones. She pops down, hiding out of sight.  Lilith thinks about it, strategizing how to do this.  Claptrap puts out his gripper, taking her foot. He's strong.  Claptrap's arm raises her up to a more perilous perch with a  better view. She takes out a small pair of binoculars.  Then the screen BLINKS - and we're magnified. BLINKS AGAIN -  more magnified - someone's watching Lilith...  LILITH'S POV:  Down below, she sees... a psycho, holding her Atlas pack.  Others waving around the various items in her pack.  High above, hanging in a cage - Lilith sees THE CHILDREN WHO  ROBBED HER. They look terrified. In the sky - RAKS. Giant  winged beasts. One at a time, they DIVEBOMB THE CAGE,  knocking into the bars, sending it swinging like a pendulum.  The kids scream. Down below - other children - working,  building, breaking rocks - Krom's slaves.  Lilith then notices a terrifying looking man wearing a metal  suit with horns, standing on a boulder. Lilith's eyes narrow.  She hears the voice in her head.  She aims the rifle at Krom's head, then follows him in her  sights as he walks over to... two soldiers wearing Red Hats,  near an ATLAS MILITARY VEHICLE. The Crimson Lance... The  soldiers glance at the kids in the cage, looking at them with  binoculars. They shake their heads no to Krom, then get back  in their Atlas vehicle...doing absolutely nothing to help.  Lilith's finger twitches, itching to shoot. Teeth gritting.  Lilith takes her eye off the sight and looks around. Just  outside the entrance, by the Outrunners, she spots a Psycho,  farther out, refueling at an old pump.  The Rak hits the cage, its claws wildly swinging inside at  the kids. The kids SCREAM. The cage swings.  Suddenly.... BOOM! The Rak DROPS DEAD, SHOT OUT OF THE SKY.  BOOM! Another shot! The cage's chain EXPLODES as it swings -  The cage breaks open on the rocks, and the kids ESCAPE! They  scramble into the cracks of the rocks like roaches.  Krom looks around, no idea what just happened. The slave  children duck in terror. The Psychos scream and charge  towards the gunfire, bloodthirsty.  Suddenly, BANG! BANG! BANG! MORE GUNFIRE, this time from a  totally different direction, confusing everyone.  Lilith looks up, mid-run, and sees a GLINT from a rifle, NOW  AIMED AT HER, from across the canyon. But it doesn't fire.  Lilith keeps running. The POV watches her, then leaves.  The Psycho refueling his car steps away from the pump to see  what the commotion is. He quickly runs back to put the hose  away, when Lilith LEAPS on him from the hood of the  Outrunner, strangling him from behind with the hose!  Claptrap wheels over to help but just gets KICKED away.  Lilith WRAPS THE GAS HOSE around the man's neck and jams the  pump into his PSYCHO MASK EYE HOLE.  Claptrap hits the lever at the pump, sending fuel into the  psycho's mask. Within seconds, he's on the ground, dead.  Claptrap notices there's only one seat, but a cage on the  back of the vehicle, used for transporting anyone unlucky.  The headless bunny is in the back. This must have been the  guy who picked up the kids.  VRRRROOOOOOMMMMM. Claptrap banging around in the cage.  Lilith barrels across the landscape, wearing the dead  Psycho's face mask. A truck full of Psychos PULLS OUT IN  FRONT OF HER. Psychos on the back ready to leap on her.  She looks to the side - another with psychos pulling up.  Lilith looks at the psycho about to leap and HOLDS UP THE  DEAD PSYCHO'S MACHETE LIKE MIDDLE FINGER AT HIM. The psychos  laugh...and peel off. They join the other vehicle, which  breaks away, leaving her. The decoy worked.  The Outrunner rolls slowly through a narrow CHANNEL and  emerges into AN ABANDONED QUARRY. Cliff walls extend up all  around, pockmarked by abandoned mining equipment. She stops.  Against the far wall of the quarry, a gargantuan pile of DEAD  VEHICLES - trucks, buses, bulldozers, you name it.  Lilith looks around. No signs of life.  CLOSE ON: a smoothed area of ground. Like 90˚ of a circle.  Lilith crouches down, examining the ground. Runs her finger  over it. Something scraped here. Something like--  A RUSTY DOOR - part of an old TANKER TRUCK on the bottom of  the vehicle stack. Lilith PULLS the door OPEN. It SCRAPES the  ground. Claptrap peers into the truck's cab from the cage.  Lilith sprinkles a little dust from the ground, illuminating  a MICRO-WIRE stretched taut across the entrance. Lilith  smiles, in her element. Runs her hands over the seat,  feeling... then looks down... then up at the roof of the  cab... Yup. Got it.  She PULLS a lever we didn't see under the seat, and FLINGS  the seat BACK, revealing a SPRING-LOADED METAL LADDER, which  SHOOTS STRAIGHT UP, PUNCHING right through a HINGED DOOR in  the ceiling of the cab. It leads right up into the fortress  of piled vehicles.  She carefully clambers over the wire and HEADS UP.  A TRAPDOOR at the bottom of a stacked RV of some sort is  PUSHED UP... and Lilith pokes her head up. Head on a swivel.  She pulls her gun. Hits the light on it. Her eyes go wide.  Holy shit. She climbs all the way in... and now we see it.  THE LAIR - someone was living here. Filthy mattress, shabby  clothes, empty skag meat tins, old bits of stuffed animals,  including a bunny head that matches the doll. And then-- A  WALL OF MADNESS.  One wall of the lair is covered in hand drawn MAPS, NOTES,  lines drawn between them all, and the writing... TREASURE  BEYOND TREASURE - FIND THE KEY - THREE PARTS - DAUGHTER OF  ERIDEA - OPEN THE VAULT - SALVATION!!!!!  And spray-painted over the whole shebang: THE SAME SHAPE  that's on Lilith's arm. Lilith moves in closer... to a page  with some kind of ancient writing... she doesn't know what it  says, but she's seen these glyphs before...  Lilith WHIRLS. Gun up. An unseen GIRL'S VOICE is ECHOING from  somewhere within the massive mountain of vehicles. And it's  humming the tune to... Pop Goes The Weasel?  The voice seems to be moving. Above. To the right. To the  left. This is a trap. Lilith is already on the move.  Lilith HURTLES out of the truck, guns ready.  ECHOING VOICE  All around the stactus plant...  The stalker chased the girly...  Lilith finally pinpoints the voice. High atop the pile of  dead vehicles... IS A 13-YEAR OLD GIRL. Ratty dress, leather  duster, band-aid across the nose, headband, streaks of pink  in her dirty hair. Is this-- ?  Tina gets a CRAZED LOOK of JOY in her eyes as she runs toward  an old-school DETONATOR. She LEAPS INTO THE AIR--  TINY TINA  She comes down HANDS-FIRST onto the detonator... Lilith RUNS  and-- KABOOOOOM! A dozen LANDMINES EXPLODE around our hero!  Lilith hits the ground hard. Face full of dust. She gets back  up just in time to see Tina KICKING A CRATE open.  She pulls the tarp off some kind of HOWITZER.  Tina then hits the BUTTON... BOOM! Lilith SLIDES under the  Outrunner. Lilith, PISSED, rolls out from under the Outrunner.  "hidin' under a car" like a B-Y-ITCH. That does it. Tiny Tina might be deadly, but she's also just a child. And Lilith has had enough. She aims her gun at Tina. CLANG. CLANG. CLANG. Deep ECHOES from within the pile of vehicles. Lilith turns to the noise. Oh god. What now? Tina makes FLESH RIPPING and EXPLOSION sounds. CLANG! A door FLINGS OPEN, and we meet: KRIEG, a shirtless, thick-muscled PSYCHO, face covered in a gasmask, only ONE EYE exposed. Claptrap starts to rattle the cage, trying to open it. Krieg lifts his CLUB - a massive PIPE fitted with some hideous SPIKED SAW BLADE at the end. Lilith lowers her gun. What? Even Tina hangs her head. Krieg CHARGES AT LILITH, club RAISED... he LEAPS IN THE AIR, she FIRES... he BLOCKS THE BULLETS with the SAW BLADE... shit, this guy's good... Lilith dives aside, barely evading the blade as Krieg SLAMS it down into the ground. WHAT? Well, that's what Lilith would have said, but Tina is now firing GRENADES from a LAUNCHER. Lilith and Krieg continue to SWING and SHOOT at each other, all while BOTH OF THEM are EVADING the bombs raining down.  MY STOMACH IS CLEAR AND MY MIND IS  FULL OF BACON! KABOOM! Grenades exploding everywhere. Only one way out of this... and that's summoning Atlas. Lilith pulls out the COMMUNICATOR, but gets BODY SLAMMED by Krieg... The communicator goes flying... and lands on the ground. As Krieg and Tina continue their assault... Claptrap tickles his own armpit with one hand, giggling, snapping the cage open. He hops down, wheeling away, bunny in claw-like gripper thingy. Tina fires off a ROCKET. KABOOM! Claptrap wheels off toward the communicator as Lilith DUCKS another swing from Krieg. Then Lilith eyes the vehicle pile. Gets an idea. She RUNS from Krieg, heading toward the pile... Tina takes AIM at Lilith, but Lilith is now SCAMPERING up the wall of vehicles. She realizes she can't hit Lilith, because she'll bring the whole wall down, and her with it. Lilith grabs a chain, shoots out a counterweight, and she's HOISTED all the way to:  Krieg can't do anything except yell from the ground.  Lilith trains her gun on Tina. Tina trains her RPG on Lilith.  Lilith makes a bold choice. Slowly lowers her gun.  Lilith pulls out the picture. It's her.  A bass RUMBLE. Lilith and Tina are immediately on HIGH ALERT.  The rumble turns LOUDER... and now it's the sound of dozens  of MOTORS... and on the CLIFF RIDGE, we see:  OUTRUNNERS AND DAHL STINGRAYS - badass dune buggies and  hovercraft with mounted turrets. Each driven by a SOLDIER IN  RED ARMOR, a mix of men and women. And every one of those  turrets is TRAINED ON LILITH.  A SOLDIER emerges from the lead outrunner. Helmeted, but we  can see her face. This is COMMANDANT STEELE, 40, eats shit  like you for breakfast, and in a terrible fucking mood.  Claptrap WHEELS INTO VIEW, far below Steele.  Tina registers surprise at that. A thief? She's looking at  Lilith with a strange new curiosity...  Lilith FIRES A SHOT down at Claptrap. PING!  Tina has come around to stand in front of Lilith. Guards her.  Tina nods toward: TWO STUFFED BUNNY RABBITS... if you can  call them that. More like stitched-together monstrosities.  But right now, they're strapped to VERY LARGE MORTAR ROCKETS.  But Tina's already pulled a REMOTE out. And hit the button.  She looks back at Lilith. Don't what now?  MUSHY SNUGGLEBITES and FELICIA SEXOPANTS roar to life and  ROCKET UP INTO THE AIR. They ZIGZAG CRAZILY IN THE SKY, then  start heading back, HOMING IN ON THE LANCE. Steele HOPS into  her OUTRUNNER, and she and EVERYONE ELSE in the Crimson Lance  try to RACE OUT OF THE WAY, as--  BOOOOOM! The mortars SLAM into the CLIFFSIDE, sending it--  and THE LANCE-- SLIDING DOWN and COLLIDING into--  --THE VEHICLE PILE, which begins to COLLAPSE DOWN. Lilith and  Tina begin to DROP with the TRUCK they were on top of...  They're both RUNNING UP the truck as the truck is SLIDING  DOWN... while Crimson Lance vehicles fire TURRETS at falling  vehicles so they don't get CRUSHED. It's like Buster Keaton in  his classic film "Holy Shit This Is Fucking Nuts" (1935).  Lilith and Tina HANG ON and SURF THEIR WAY DOWN. The truck  LANDS wheels first on the ground, and they're both TOSSED OFF.  Lilith hits the ground hard. Like the fourth time today. SOUND  GOES OUT - shellshock... she looks around, vision TILTED... sees  STEELE is driving toward them - TURRET READY to kill her... This  is it? This is how I die??? What a bunch of bullshit.  THE TURRET AIMS... STEELE PULLS THE TRIGGER, and... SCREEEEE! A  HUGE TRICKED OUT VEHICHLE - THE BANDIT TECHNICAL - SKIDS TO A  STOP in front of Lilith... its armor BLOCKING THE SHOT! The  door opens. It's-- ROLAND! From the poster! Except his face is  covered with a gaiter, so Lilith doesn't quite see it yet.  A HAIL OF BULLETS showers the OTHER SIDE of the Bandit  Technical. No time to question. Lilith grabs TINA by the arm,  and throws her into the Technical. Krieg rushes to join them,  jumping in with Lilith. Lilith Behind Roland, Krieg behind  Tina.  As soon as they're in, MYSTERY GUY punches it... CLAPTRAP  wheels after them. BULLETS firing all around him.  IN THE TECHNICAL... Roland turns to Lilith. Well?  IN THE TECHNICAL... ah, shit. Lilith pushes the wheel,  causing the Technical to SPIN to a stop. Tina FLINGS OPEN the  door, Krieg GRABS CLAPTRAP and PULLS HIM IN... Tina sees the  headless bunny and grabs it, snuggling it.  ...and they PEEL OUT AGAIN.  STEELE watches with white-hot rage as the Technical drives  off. Then she hops back in the saddle, hits the  AFTERBURNERS... the rest of the Lance does, too, and:  THE CHASE begins. Our heroes (who mostly all hate each other)  in the Bandit Technical, pursued at HIGH SPEED by STEELE and  THE CRIMSON LANCE... We INTERCUT between the chase and the  interior of the TECHNICAL, which swerves WILDLY to avoid the  INCOMING FIRE.  Lilith pulls a gun on her.  Krieg puts his BLADE CLUB to Lilith's throat. Roland puts a gun to Krieg's head (steers with the other). Claptrap just looks around at all of them, crammed into this vehicle, weapons at each other's heads, and EXPLOSIONS impacting all around them. Lilith thinks. Then shifts her aim to Roland's head. He shifts his aim to Lilith. Krieg shifts his BLADE CLUB to his own throat. Tina CLAPS at that. WHOOHOO! So much fun! Roland lowers his gun. Pulls down his gaiter, revealing a grizzled veteran, 40, but instantly readable as a decent man. PING! BANG! They're shot at, everyone remembers who they're actually fighting. She opens her jacket to reveal LOADS OF GRENADES AND SUCH. BOOM! Another volley ROCKS the Technical... Roland glances at Tina, grows serious.  in the vault and do a somersault-- WHABOOOOM! CLOSER!  QUIT PREACHING AND SAVE HER ASS. Roland pulls a lever and EXTENDS THE WHEEL back to Lilith, who leans in and steers from the back seat Roland pulls another lever, engaging the gas - SPEEDING UP. The entire vehicle has manual "auto pilot" functions. He operates it all with incredible agility, speed, and skill. Like cat, Roland jumps up spins around backwards, popping out the window, on the sill, legs inside, FIRING AT THE LANCE.  Steele, behind him driving, dodges, firing back.  Lilith steers, shots missing. Roland shoots A SMALL ROCKET  LAUNCHER. As Lilith leans over to steer, Tina TICKLES her.  Lilith ELBOWS Tina off.  Tina leans back, tickling Krieg.  She tickles Krieg, he loves it, banging his hands. Lilith  swerves. Roland loses balance, almost falling out.  Tina puts her hands over Lilith's eyes.  Claptrap - THE COMMINICATOR, NOW! Claptrap passes the communicator to the steering Lilith. Tiny Tina reaches under Claptraps armpits tickling Claptrap... and his PINCER HAND closes down on it, BREAKING THE COMMUNICATOR with a CRUNCH. Everyone stares. Krieg and Tina laugh like this is the funniest thing in the world. Lilith briefly considers blowing her own head off in pure frustration... but the INCOMING FIRE makes it clear there's only one thing she can really do. She hands Claptrap the wheel, and stands, popping out of the turret, face to face with Roland. Claptrap steers. Tina tries to tickle him, but Claptrap uses an arm to swat her away. Krieg giggles. Lilith starts FIRING BACK at the pursuing CRIMSON LANCE OUTRUNNERS. Lilith and Roland actually make a great team. Each one impressed with the other's shooting skills.  HIGH VIEW - an army of vehicles chasing their single prey.  They're entering a long ROCKY VALLEY lined on either side by  long-abandoned scaffolding and PIPEWORK.  Roland drops down, pulling Lilith. He takes the wheel.  Tina sniffs the air. Yuck. Krieg smells it too. Likes it.  SPLASH! The Technical ZOOMS by, splashing our lens with the  lovely drainage still pouring out of those pipes.  IN THE TECHNICAL - Lilith's back in her seat. BUCKLES UP. The  ground starts RUMBLING... and the Technical starts  SHUDDERING. Lilith isn't surprised. Neither is Roland.  And then: CRAAAACK! A monster-- a PANDORAN THRESHER-- erupts  from below. What does it look like? Imagine the kind of  monster that would live underground in a place called  Pisswash Gully. Any more stupid questions? I mean, come on.  Roland spins in CONTROLLED HYDROPLANE, around the Thresher.  The Lance Outrunner behind them gets caught in the wet slick  of Thresher piss, spinning out. Tina smells the breeze.  SPLASH. Liquid, that shall not be named here - spills into  the technical. Everyone EEEEEWWW. Tina LAUGHS.  I MEANT THE WINDOW! ROLL UP THE DAMN  Roland SWERVES, barely avoiding the THRESHER ATTACK. CRACK!  More THRESHERS explode up, WHIPPING their nasty TENTACLES.  The Bandit Technical spins in a donut, winding up Face to  Face with STEELE.  Steele's eyes narrow as she floors it, but a WAVE OF THRESHER  PISS sends her vehicle hydroplaning.  BEHIND THE TECHNICAL - few CRIMSON LANCER STINGRAYS get taken  out by MORE THRESHERS... a few Wilhelm Screams later, and it  becomes clear... this entire gully is INFESTED... Lilith  keeps her eyes peeled. Watching the shimmering of the PISS  POOLS up ahead... signs of impending THRESHING...  Roland Floors it, trying to keep it steady. The Outrunners  flanking him now, coming at him from all sides. Then,  another flash of piss - EVERYONE goes spinning now.  The crew screams, but Roland keeps his cool, shifting gears,  hitting buttons, activating burners, thrusts, air vents,  anything to keep control of the truck.  OR WE GONNA SWIM OUR WAY OUT?  Straight ahead... A LARGE BUBBLING... WHIRLPOOL.  BOOM. A GLUTTONOUS THRESHER EXPLODES UPWARDS... this is the  biiiig mamajama of Threshers...It roars, the whirlpool in  front of it.  Roland sees a ROOF SECTION, spinning among the debris in the  whirpool. Round, and round and round. Lilith sees.  Roland THROTTLES UP. He backs up the technical. The  remaining Lance vehicles arranging themselves on the sides to  block them in.  Roland HITS THE AFTERBURNERS, PINNING THEM ALL BACK - heading  right to the whirlpool - and the giant ass Thresher!  Roland white knuckles it as he drives RIGHT AT THE WHIRLPOOL,  TIMING IT PERFECTLY TO HIT THE SPINNING ROOF.  He hits the roof - FIRING REAR ROCKETS - the momentum  LAUNCHES THE TECHNICAL into the air...  The Thresher OPENS ITS MOUTH TO SWALLOW THEM.  The vehicle flies INTO THE CREATURE'S MOUTH, BREAKING OUT THE  OTHER SIDE OF ITS HEAD with a SPLAT! The Technical smacks  onto HIGH GROUND overlooking the Gully - and keeps going!  In the Gully, Steele watches, amazed, as the Big Mama  Thresher DROPS DEAD. Once it does, the others retreat  underground. The Bandit speeds away, long gone. A Lance  soldier runs up next to Steele.  She RAPID-FIRES HER GUN IN THE AIR, SCREAMING.  Roland slows the car down to a stop behind some old scrap  metal, hiding behind rocks.  Lilith and Roland are about to PANIC THE FUCK OUT, when... a  MUFFLED KABOOM, and CLAPTRAP is bounced UP, hits the roof,  and bounces back down.  Everyone washes off by a well, which Roland also uses to pump  water and clean off the Bandit. He makes some adjustments to  the license plates and front bumper. Lilith eyes Tina. Claptrap presses a button on his chest. ROLAND'S RECORDED VOICE from 5 minutes ago plays: Lilith raises an eyebrow: Well? Claptrap surveys the broken pieces.  LET'S GO FAST! Krieg raises his club again. Thrilled. Krieg looks at Tina. Can I please kill her? Roland considers, turns to Tina. Off Tina, not failing to notice Lilith used her "real" name this time instead of Allara. She grins, then: That line again. But this time, pain in Tina's eyes. A young, lost child's need for validation. I am special. But Lilith isn't ready to give anything back. So: Tina reaches into her coat. Everyone flinches... is it explode-o'-clock again? Tina pulls out-- her FIST to reveal AN ERIDEAN ARTIFACT. A small piece of carved purple stone, flat on one side, curved on the other, and covered in tiny RUNES that seem to GLISTEN SLIGHTLY. It's beautiful. Lilith and Roland are stunned. Lilith doesn't want to. Because it can't be. Off Lilith: No. No, no, no. She shakes it off. Roland takes her wrist. Reveals that TATTOO on her arm. The same shape carved around the VAULT KEY PIECE. She pulls her hand away with real strength. Now she's angry.  Another truck approaches. Roland looks up, smiling.  SCOOTER, a trucker hat grease monkey, looks like he stepped  out of a 1970's truck stop. His truck reads: SCOOTER'S  SCRAPYARD: Engine Parts, Electrical & Fan Service. Scooter  hops out, spitting on the ground.  Scooter removes his hat, smiling a greasy smile at Lilith.  Lilith pulls her gun, he shuts up. She gets in the truck.  Roland hands Scooter the keys to the technical.  Welcome to the BIG CITY! I mean , it's still a miserable heap  built out of the exposed top portion of the long-abandoned  Dahl™ Prime Mining Ship, but for Pandora, it's a metropolis.  As the gang cruises by the city’s heavy DEFENSE GATE. Lance  soldiers check cars going through the front gate.  Roland gets on his radio. He slightly changes his voice,  speaking in code for whoever's listening in.  A woman in a sassy voice answers on the other end. Gamers  will recognize her right away...  Everyone looks at each other. "Skag Pup?"  More raucous laughter. Roland quickly shuts it off.  Awkward silence.  They pull into a door marked #2, into a giant garbage dump.  There seems to be no system of organization whatsoever, just  chutes dumping all kinds of trash into huge piles.  The group runs through, coughing, sliding, covering their  noses. Claptrap looks totally happy, garbage in his wheels.  They run up to a wall, where a rope ladder drops down. They  begin to climb. They send Tina first, who climbs on Krieg's  back as he climbs.  They climb over a wall, where they're met by ELLIE, a big  girl, early 20s, in overalls.  She picks up Roland, squeezing him.  Ellie hands them each strange looking COLLARS. Everyone puts  them on, cycling through various holographic masks. Tina  gets to one that's greyed out with a lock.  Everyone puts on the collars, rotating through heads.  Vendors. Street urchins. Folks scratching out a living. Hard  faces and scowls. And a few Crimson Lance patrolling.  Everyone's heads have now been replaced with holograms.  Lilith wears "Horrorpunk," Krieg "Birdcollar," Roland the  skully "Immort4l," (as well as a religious robe), Tina has  the Frankenstein-ish "Simul4Crum," and Claptrap has an extra  eye and fake mouth. They walk by relatively unnoticed.  They walk past Roland's HOLOGRAPHIC WANTED POSTER.  Roland looks at Tina as they pass. She's impressed.  Krieg looks at vendors selling strange animal food. He grabs  a bite of BBQ meat, continuing. Nobody dares stop him.  Krieg picks up Tina, putting her on his shoulders. As soon as  she does, Tina SWIPES a pack of gum off a high shelf and  pockets it before the proprietor can see.  Look at that, it’s Marcus! You know, the kooky bus driver  from the beginning? He’s at a MARCUS TOURS & MUNITIONS kiosk.  Lilith flips them both off, keeps walking.  If a small military hanger had a three-way with the USCSS  Nostromo and an unlicensed Irish pub it would be Moxxi's.  MOXXI walks over. 50's and still got it. Wedged into a red  Victorian bustier. Mostly. Top hat on her head. Face?  Powdered white. My god, the things she could do to you. She puts her hand out to shake Lilith's, but instead pulls her wrist a little and looks at the tattoo. She pulls Krieg with her as they follow Moxxi. Roland follows last. Suddenly a hand on his shoulder. Roland reluctantly turns to see a fellow LANCE soldier. This one, however, looks more like the computer nerd of the group. Roland turns off his collar, revealing his face. He points to the boots, which have a cool "R" drawn on them.  Roland carefully snaps his fingers for Claptrap, gesturing to  go into his bag and get out a weapon.  Claptrap, below the bar seat, reaches into Roland's bag and  hands up a wallet into Roland's expectant hand. Roland throws  it back, miming a gun with his fingers. Claptrap then hands  him shaving cream. Roland tosses it, his hand getting mad.  Roland smiles, fake charming. He snaps at Claptrap, who  picks underwear, breath mints - finally picking up a gun.  Moxxi goes over a map of Sanctuary with Lilith.  Knock twice- password's ECHO.  Krieg and Tiny Tina share a soda with two straws. They MMMMM.  Moxxi smiles and turns back to Lilith, more serious.  Moxxi nods, understanding.  Roland and Larry laugh, mid-conversation. Both of them  sloooowly readying guns behind their backs.  Larry pulls his gun when BZZZT. Moxxi SHOCKS Larry with a  zapper. He drops to the ground, unconscious.  They leave, saying thanks. As they exit, two Lance soldiers  pass by and spot Larry on the floor. Before the soldiers can  accuse anything, Moxxi turns on them, putting on an act.  The Soldier steps up to Moxxi, gets in her face. She doesn't  back down, but it's clear who would win this fight. He looks  around the room, staring everyone down. Then fake smiles.  They pick up Larry and drag him out of there. Moxxi watches  them go. The crowd goes back to drinking as usual.  The group turns into a quiet residential alley.  Tina sighs, annoyed, and pulls out the gum she swiped.  Tina passes Roland the gum, making sure to chew extra loud to  annoy Lilith. Roland plays along.  explosion.  WHAT THE FUCK. Roland SPITS THAT SHIT OUT as Lilith grabs  Tina, and SMACKS HER ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD, tossing it into  the alley. HALF A SECOND LATER -- BOOM! BOOM! Dust. Rubble.  People look out of their windows above. The group runs.  They round a corner...  They've arrived at a door... perhaps once a maintenance hatch  in the mining ship.  She knocks twice.  Nothing happens.  Like "Echo echo echo..."  The door buzzes open. Tiny strolls past Roland and Lilith.  Soon as they enter, Lilith’s jaw drops. This place is like  Tina's lair times a thousand. Not just maps and notes and  plans. There are ERIDEAN ARTIFACTS here. TABLETS. ANCIENT  SCROLLS. There are blueprints and soil samples and MOSAICS of  ANCIENT ALIEN WOMEN...  ...and that SHAPE. The same SHAPE on Lilith's arm. On almost  everything. It's the one common symbol.  Lilith stands there, awestruck. The rest of the gang  continues around the corner--  --where TANNIS, 60, glances up from a workstation. Short  silver hair, magnifying goggles on head, and the unblinking,  steady gaze of a neuro-atypical scientist who sees a little  less than you... but also a whole lot more. Tannis eyes Tina’s extended hand like it’s covered in warts. She’s not the social type. Tannis just studies it. They turn to see Lilith, who has just caught up. She stares daggers at Tannis. Her worst memory flooding back. Chills her to the bone. Tannis registers nothing. Until Lilith holds up her arm and shows her tattoo. And at that, with zero emotion: Tannis gestures over to a stall in the corner. It looks like a cross between a phone booth and a UV lamp for plants. Tina jumps in and presses a button, which zaps her with light. Krieg, Roland and Tina all struggle for position in the shower. The light zaps again. Tina's HAIR stands on end.  BZZZZT. Claptrap spins around, on Robot speed.  Lilith storms into another room and slams the door. Krieg  goes to sit in an inconspicuous wooden chair--  Krieg looks at the chair. It's just a chair.  Lilith stares at the various maps of the planet, the mines.  All vault related. Tannis comes in without her seeing.  And before you have a chance to figure out exactly what the  hell that's all about... there's the sound of AN ALARM.  Night is falling. The guards are signaling the citizens to  get inside the gate.This is a daily routine, but no one seems  particularly comforted. For the citizens... nothing but fear  at night.  Roland peers out a porthole window. The old and young hustle  to get indoors. The able-bodied take up arms.  Guards and armed citizens stand watch on rooftops, all  illuminated by spotlights that scan the area around the city.  A few LARGE ARTILLERY WEAPONS are manned by multiple guards.  LILITH - on the roof, rifle in hand, staring out into the  night with more than just anger. Memories.  IN THE DISTANCE - PSYCHO VEHICLES race by, their lunatic  occupants firing wildly into the sky.  Lilith grips her gun tighter. Uncharacteristically rattled...  She turns to see TINA standing by the access hatch that leads  to the roof. Quickly puts the wall back up.  Fine. Whatever. Lilith can't control this kid, and they both  know it. Lilith turns back to her watch.  Tina takes up watch on her own part of the roof. Weirdly  looking back at Lilith, as if taking cues. Standing the way  Lilith stands. Moving her eyes back and forth. The two of them stay silent for a moment. Then...  Eridea can open it. He found a piece  there was a tiny bit of blood. Lilith turns. How smart is this girl? She turns to Lilith, with resolve.  She starts to tear up. Lilith instinctively puts her arm  around her. A motherly instinct for the first time.  The BULLHORNS return, Krom’s marauders continuing their  propaganda. A Pandoran lullaby.  ALL WILL SUFFER THE RAGE OF KROM.  Lilith peers out into the night, a far-away look in her eyes.  We PUSH IN, that shiver-inducing voice echoing in her:  The same BULLHORN TRUCK. The same voice.  BULLHORN PSYCHO  ALL WILL SUFFER THE RAGE OF KROM.  Fires in the distance. Screams. Pandora has fallen. The  psychos are coming. A WOMAN, 30s, rushes with her 8-year-old  daughter in her arms. We know them from the SPACEPORT  BILLBOARD. This is YOUNG LILITH and LILITH'S MOTHER.  AN OPEN JUMPSHIP is waiting, ready to take people away, like  the last helicopter out of Vietnam. A younger TANNIS is on  the ship, waiting. Lilith's Mother finally gets there, and--  --hands Lilith to Tannis. Lilith doesn't understand.  Instantly overwhelmed with fear as her mother backs away.  The gunfire is upon them. Tannis drags Lilith onto the  getaway ship, even as she fights with all her might.  Lilith's Mother loads a gun. Races for her TRUCK to escape the  madness. BUT AS THE OPEN JUMPSHIP RISES IN THE AIR, she sees:  KROM. Lord of the Psychos arrives like a barbarian conqueror  of old, riding atop a HUGE TANK. He aims a rocket launcher at  her mother.  Lilith screams... Her mother looks at Lilith as she rises up  into the air. An explosion. And the end of everything.  Lilith AWAKENS with a jolt. Then she remembers. Looks around,  no sign of Tina. Some primal instinct kicking into gear.  Lilith comes sliding down the LADDER:  Tina looks up from the table. Mouth full of sugary Atlas  brand SPLODEO'S™ cereal.  Lilith exhales, relief quickly turning to mild embarrassment.  Roland has his guns laid out, cleaning them.  A look between Tina and Lilith. Tina puts her spoon down.  Tannis leads Lilith into her study.  Claptrap rolls through the market, strutting like Saturday  Night Fever Travolta. He waves hi and greets the other  robots, who steer clear of him.  A robot GLITCHES angry robotic noises at him as he passes.  He wheels by Moxxi's and sees Moxxi and Ellie with their  hands spread out, flat on the bar. Two LANCE SOLDIERS behind  them with guns trained on them. STEELE interrogates.  Moxxi shoots Claptrap a look, then refocuses Steele.  Ellie gives Claptrap the get the hell outta here look. Larry,  a bit dazed, suddenly sees Claptrap, recognizing him.  Steele turns, and just misses Claptrap. She runs out into  the crowd, and can't see him, but by the way he's wheeling  into people as he speeds away.  Steele turns back to Moxxi, death stare. Signals for one  soldier to come with her. Turns to Larry.  Steele and the other solder chase after Claptrap, knocking  people out of the way.  As soon as Steele's gone, Larry turns to Moxxi, posturing  like he's gonna boss her around, when Ellie SQUEEZES HIS HEAD  IN HER HANDS LIKE A VICE GRIP. Larry shakes and drops to the  ground, out cold.  Ellie slumps Larry over her shoulder, carrying him through  the back door by herself. Moxxi follows behind.  A MOUNTAIN OF WEAPONS. Machine guns. Explosives. Combat  rifles. Matter fact, just put all the in-game weapons on the  damn table. Fan-service this shit up. Roland inspects and  packs them, trying to stop Tina and Krieg from touching them.  Tannis produces a DUSTY OLD JOURNAL from a high shelf. Tannis opens the journal. Lays it atop the weaponry. Page after page of scribbled notes, lists, maps... She turns a page... a SKETCH...  ECHO ECHO ECHO, OH NEVER MIND, RUN!  WE HAVE TO RUN! THEY'RE COMING. Claptrap has burst into the front door and closes it behind him. Krieg jumps up, ready for battle, slamming the door.  roll, what the dillio?  POUNDING at the door.  Roland is already suiting up for battle. Tina grabs guns  too. Lilith has to take them out of her hands.  They hear a metallic BANG from the BACK window. Bang Bang,  like a metal lid banging a garbage can.  Tannis looks out the window, into an alley. Outside she sees  Moxxi and Ellie, with a large garbage bin, waving them down.  Two large men dressed as garbagemen stand with them.  Steele gives the command to several soldiers who solder off  the front door's locks and kick it in.  They break in and find...nobody home. Just something  simmering on the stove. A liquid...Steele smells it. She  looks around. Suddenly, she realizes she's in danger and  covers her mouth.  She turns to run, but stops...and yawns. Suddenly tired. A  little dizzy. Delirious, even...  Steele passes out. The other soldiers look confused. They  boiling steam fills the room, and they too yawn. One sits on  Clork the chair like it's the best thing EVER.  Clork collapses. And like that, they're all fast asleep.  Two workers roll the garbage bin through a back alley.  Roland, Tannis, Krieg, Tiny Tina and Claptrap all cram  together inside the garbage bin.  And with that they are DUMPED DOWN A GARBAGE CHUTE. Sliding,  sliding, sliding - landing in an outdoor pile.  They have to RUN through the trash to get to the truck,  coughing and gagging on the smell.  They make it to the truck. Roland jumps in to drive, but the  wheels are slipping on the garbage.  Roland hits the gas again, and Krieg uses his super human  strength to PUSH THE TRUCK, and get it running. Everyone  jumps in.  The truck drives through the barren salt flats.  They ride in silence. Miserable.  She pulls out a small note pad, and writes this down.  Everyone glares at her, amazed. That was even an option?  Tannis pockets the notebook and pulls out a small zapper,  like a travel version of her shower. Everyone watches her, as  she cleans herself. She now looks like she just came out of  hair & make up, the others basically just left Burning Man.  She sniffs herself and puts the zapper away. Everyone just  stares at her. She doesn't quite get why everyone glares.  They walk from the truck to a small shack, near the base of a  large abandoned mine. Roland carries the gun.  Lilith hangs back with Claptrap. Looking at the IMAGE on her  forearm. Wondering if she's been wrong this whole time...  Lilith looks Tina, who holds Krieg's machete handle, the  blade end in Krieg's hand. They swing it together merrily.  PITCH BLACK. Until... CREEEEEEAK! A PORTHOLE opens above us.  Sunlight blasts inside. And five silhouettes peek down.  TINY TINA'S ECHO  HELLLOOOOOO! HELLLOOOOO! HELLLLOOOOOO!  In a valley between large promontories, the gang encircles a  METAL HATCH etched into a small patch of concrete.  OF THE WORRRLLD! OF THE WORRRLLD!  Lilith facepalms.  Then Roland looks at everyone else. Shrugs.  One by one, they all climb down. When they're all in, Krieg  pulls the hatch shut. And we get to see the "TOXIC: DO NOT  ENTER. REALLY." warning on the other side...  A RIVER OF BUBBLING, BOILING, YELLOW-GREEN DEATH. It winds  ahead, contained by a natural channel of PURPLE CRYSTAL, with  a natural current moving DOWN and into a TUNNEL ahead.  An abandoned MINE BOAT - just a rusty tub carved into a large  chunk of crystal. It's moored to the rocky "shore."  Excited, Krieg HOPS into the MINE BOAT. His impact pushes the  mine boat down... the LIQUID DEATH alllllmost spills over the  side... then the boat rises back up.  Lilith scowls at him, then carefully lifts and places Tina in  the boat. She follows. Then Tannis. And finally Roland. With  each added passenger, the boat sinks lower. The liquid death  is barely under the lip of the boat. Just five more pounds,  and-- Claptrap wheels over, ready to come aboard.  Everyone points a weapon at him. Do not get on this boat.  Tannis points to a RUSTY TRACK that rises up into a small  access tunnel in the rock.  With that lovely farewell, he WHEELS UP THE RAILING, and heads  out of view. Tannis releases the catch that moors the boat,  and they begin FLOATING along with the current into a...  It’s A Small World's dastardly cousin. The gang drifts along. Tense. Silent, save for the gurgling sounds of certain acidic death. A bat-like creature falls from the top into the river, liquifying instantly. Roland speaks in a quiet voice only Lilith can hear. Tannis leans back, having heard everything.  A small BLUE CRYSTAL juts out from the eridium. The Mine Boat  floats past it and... Did that CRYSTAL JUST MOVE? Fuck. It  did. Like it was some UNSEEN MONSTER’S EYE. And-- wait a sec--  yep, that was a GROWL. The creature watches them...  The mine boat floats slowly to the EDGE, where there's a  makeshift dock built out of a crystal formation. They moor  the boat and get out, stepping on to the dirt shore. Up  ahead, a WALL OF METAL. On it, in huge letters:  "DAHL MINING, the world is ours," with "ours" crossed out  and KROMZ scratched over it.  They walk over to Tina, who is crouched on the rocky ground  over: A TINY PANDORAN SAPLING, pushing through the parched  soil here, in defiance of everything this place is.  They all stare at it. Even now, even here, they can't help  but fall prey to the most human of delusions. Hope. Until  CLAPTRAP emerges from an ACCESS TUNNEL above, and lands WHEEL-  FIRST on the sapling, CRUSHING IT.  They all stare in horror as he does THE TWIST in celebration,  which means his wheel is GRINDING THE SAPLING into the dirt.  Up ahead, a DOOR in the huge wall opens as Claptrap  approaches. Our heroes all look sadly at the DEAD SAPLING,  then ready their weapons. Time to head in.  They move carefully down a corridor. Rusty scaffolds line the  walls. After a few steps, Krieg STOPS dead. And puts a hand  out to stop Tina from walking further. He's scared. He's  looking at: RED PAINT smeared on a rock. The shape of an EYE.  Tina gets excited. Opens her jacket. Loads of BOMBS.  First time she's said it back to Tina, who sort of pretends  to be sulky about being protected, but mostly? Heart full.  Lilith and Roland's heads peeks over the top, looking at the  BLOODSHOT PSYCHO STRONGHOLD. A ramshackle settlement of  abandoned vehicles, shipping containers and scrap metal.  Scattered about: PSYCHOS, all with the BLOODSHOT SYMBOL on  their chests and armor. Cooking skagmeat, peeing off ledges,  chasing TINKS with FLAMETHROWERS-- you know, the usual.  Roland sinks back down behind the top of the scaffolding to  stay out of sight. Lilith joins him. Can see he's tense.  Lilith and Roland return to the rest of the party.  A Bloodshot Psycho waddles out of his makeshift hut, huge  MACHINE GUN in hand. Then stops as he hears: Dozens of Psychos turn at once to see: CLAPTRAP, wheeling right up to the middle of their stronghold. TO THE SIDE - our heroes - moving silently, single-file behind a shack. Lilith glares at him. Idiot. THE PSYCHOS - transfixed. Staring at Claptrap in confusion. ANGLE ON: Tina, on the side, mouthing along with him... BACK ON CLAPTRAP: And that's the last word he gets out before A THOUSAND BULLETS rain down on him. Claptrap FLOPS OVER, tries to wheel away, gets PINBALLED back and forth by bullets, as OUR HEROES SKEDADDLE. They duck through the stronghold UNSEEN, while: In the B.G., psychos WHEEL A MAKESHIFT CANNON into view. Oh, this is gonna be good...  IN THE RIVER - The blue creature, hearing the gunfire, moves  towards the noise.  Our heroes climb up into view, onto a raised area beyond the  stronghold. BANGBANGBANGBANG. The psychos are really giving  it to poor Claptrap.  wha-BOOM! The sound of CANNONFIRE, and our heroes watch as  something is shot out from the stronghold, arcing across the  massive cavern, heading toward--  Lilith GRABS Tina and yanks her out of the way just before:  CLAPTRAP lands at their feet like a mortar shell. Tumbles  head over wheel for a bit, then wobbles back up.  He wheels slowly up to her. Pissed. Looks her in the eyes.  Tannis steps towards a HUGE warehouse door when - PING. They  stop, hearing a noise. Ping. Ping. They turn to see Claptrap  expelling bullets from his back side.  They wait for him to finish, then turn back to walk when  PINGPINGPINGPINGPING. They freeze, hoping this will end.  ...standing still, waiting for it...all good, back on the  move- PINGPINGPINGPINGPING.  Tiny Tina and Krieg are about to explode in laughter. Lilith  is ready to shoot him again.  Ping.  DARKNESS gives way to light as a door CREAKS OPEN. CRATES  visible. Dead silent. Lilith leads the others inside.  They sweep their lights across the room. There are HUNDREDS  AND HUNDREDS of crates in here.  Lilith doesn't pay attention, moving through rows of crates.  Something under her skin...almost like a compass, guides her.  She stops, takes two steps back. Crouches down. In between  two large crates, a smaller metal box. She flips the lid off  and looks inside. Rocks, mostly.  She dumps rocks out, reflected light glittering in her eyes.  Tina notices, and sees the glowing object. She tugs at  Tannis' shirt, pointing, but Tannis is busy bickering with  Roland. They swing their lights to see Lilith, who holds up... A KEY PART. Identical to the one Tina has. Lilith shrugs. Odd. She's not really sure herself. You know, this is the kind of story where no one ever seems to catch a break, so let's just take a moment to feel GOOD about this. There was a plan, it worked, she found the-- Oh. Shit. I'm suuuper sorry, but a huge BLUE CRYSTAL HAND has just PUNCHED its way up through the floor and GRABBED LILITH. Introducing... the CRYSTALISK! Think Mighty Joe Young, but mostly made of crystal and insane. Roland AIMS his gun, but there's no way he can fire without risking killing Lilith. Lilith THROWS the key piece to Roland. SLO-MO: Roland PICKS UP TINA, who reaches out in panic at Lilith, who is going to die. We've seen this before... But Tiny Tina isn't Tiny Lilith. Tiny Tina is a goddamned lunatic clone-made daughter of Eridea with a few megatons in her jacket, and that THING isn't taking her Lilith away. So she flips the pin off the STICKY GRENADE in her hand, and FLINGS IT... and we watch it arc past Lilith's face and land squarely on THE CRYSTALISK'S BUTT. AN EXPLOSION - as the Crystalisk's ass is blown apart, along with the rest of him, in a shower of blue ickyness. Lilith hits the ground. Holy shit. Looks at Tina. Thank you. But no time for handshakes and air kisses, because the ground is rumbling, and so everyone RUNS... 112 EXT. ESCAPE FROM CAUSTIC CAVERNS - 0% CHANCE OF SURVIVAL! 112  Our heroes RUN from the warehouse, and behind them... TWO  MORE CRYSTALISKS. Huge BEASTS in pursuit. But this is  Borderlands, so you gotta know the Bloodshot Psychos heard  Tina's big kaboom, and they're running toward our heroes. So  at least we've got that not going for us.  Lilith sees: A MINESHAFT off to the side, in the no man's  land between the Crystalisks behind and the psychos ahead.  They bolt into the entrance to the mine, Psychos closing in  behind them, followed by Crystalisks. Lilith and Roland turn  back, shooting, blasting Psychos, who don't seem to be at all  intimidated by the gunfire. It only angers them more.  Down the tunnel - an ELEVATOR PLATFORM made of CRYSTAL,  sitting at the bottom of a shaft.  Elevator cables are broken. Power supply's busted open.  Bloodshots round the corner, along with more Crystallisks.  Lilith and Roland shoot, but too many coming. Lilith sees  some liquid death bubbling through cracks in the rock walls.  She turns to Tina, looking her in the eye.  Redraw the--? Ohhhhh. You mean? A bunch at once? Now? Aww  yeah! Tina steps forward. She flips her coat open, pulls a  shit-ton of tiny bombs out by the harness they're hanging  from, then SPINS and THROWS...  She then takes out The Headless Bunny, and pulls the cord in  its back. She tosses it and covers her hear ears, as do the  others. The Psychos stop and pick up the bunny, puzzled. BOOOOOOM! The entire floor of the cavern is ROCKED by a world- class explosion, setting the entire facility QUAKING. Some Psychos and Crystalisks are still alive, though, and as they pick themselves up: The ground QUAKES AGAIN, and this time... FOOSH! A geyser of GREEN YELLOW LIQUID DEATH crashes through a crumbling wall, and only now do we realize Lilith's plan. WHAAA--BOOOOOM!!!! All of the cavern walls begin to fail at once, and a TIDAL WAVE of LIQUID DEATH pours in, flooding the massive cavern, killing everything it touches. A Crystallisk runs at them - but is hit with a geyser of liquid, killing it. The floor below rumbles, but the car doesn't move. Liquid shoots around the outside of the car. Tannis looks up sees something in the ceiling. The liquid pushes up below the elevator car - trying to force it upwards. The car rattles, trying to move up. Tannis looks up at the open ceiling, seeing a beam.  THAT BEAM'S BLOCKING US! Roland and Krieg battle psychos, whose bodies land in the car, making a little pile. Lilith sees the beam holding them back, then RUNS UP the psycho pile - LEAPING - grabbing a ceiling beam! She swings her legs up, her head now upside down, and kicks at the metal cross beam jamming them! A geyser BURSTS into the wall, and Krieg grabs an attacking psycho, PLUGGING THE LEAK WITH HIS HEAD. Liquid runs out of the psycho's eyes and mouth.  The floor now bubbling, liquid death leaking into the car.  They dance around it.  Tannis rides Claptrap for safety. Tina rides on Krieg's back.  Lilith kicks, kicks and kicks, finally - MOVES THE BEAM.  FWHOOSH! THE PLATFORM is PROPELLED UPWARD by the massive  force of a LIQUID DEATH GEYSER... the crystal protecting our  heroes, but they're rocketing up at insane speed, and:  They BLAST up and through a mesh VENTILATION SCREEN at the  top of the promontory, and get FLUNG into the air...  Whiskey barrels everywhere, along with rows set up like pews,  about twenty Pandoran citizens and their families in an  intimate ceremony.  At the alter, SIR ALEISTER HAMMERLOCK, a Pandora version of  an 19th century British dandy explorer, and WAINWRIGHT  JAKOBS, a whiskey drinking Southerner, dressed in their  Sunday best. They stand by a wedding cake under an alter.  A Justice of the Peace reads from a book, whiskey in hand.  The crowd laughs.  CRASH! Our heroes smash into the tent on the platform,  crashing right into the cake table.  EVEYRONE PULLS GUNS. Lilith, Tina, Roland, Tannis, and  Claptrap all stand, politely. The whole gathering in total  shock. Our heroes slooooooooowly exit, stage left.  They step outside, Roland shows Lilith the vault key piece.  They look up and see: THE ENTIRE CRIMSON LANCE pulling up,  guns trained on them. Steele at a turret. Roland glances at Lilith, eyes shooting over to a "Just Married" VW Bus close by. He slips her the vault key piece. Roland PULLS OUT TWO GUNS, FIRING AT STEELE, RUNNING AT HER. She dives down into her truck. Chaos. Gunfire. Running. Lilith grabs Tina, running for the VW. Lance firing at them. Hammerlock and Jakobs DEFEND LILITH and company as they run for the VW, firing at the Lance. The wedding guests jump in on the action, shooting at the Lance, who they all clearly hate. Roland, draws fire, with incredible tactical moves, rolling, shooting, firing. Steele ducking in her tank.  Lilith turns, Jakobs tosses her the VW keys. She nods thanks  and gets in the bus, pulling away. Steele sees.  But the wedding guests block, shooting. No way to chase.  Lilith and company speed away. Two RAKS dive bomb the VW.  Jakobs takes a sip of whiskey and shoots down one of the  Raks. Hammerlock gives him a little kiss.  The second Rakk DIVE BOMBS LILITH.  Tannis grabs the wheel while Lilith SHOOTS THE SECOND RAK,  WHO LANDS, SPLATTING ON THE WINDSHIELD.  Krieg and Lilith pull the Rak off the windshield while Tannis  steers, but it's still smeared in blood.  Lilith wipes the guts and sees they're headed FOR A HILL! The  bus SLIDES DOWN THE HILL, OUT OF CONTROL.  NEAR ROLAND, the Lance soldiers have him, but everyone now  just watches the bus as it careens TOWARDS A CLIFF. The  fighting has stopped to watch the bus, in horror.  IN THE VW BUS: everyone screams.  WE'RE GONNA DIE! I MEAN, THEY ARE.  I'M FREE! I'M FREE!  The bus skids OVER THE CLIFF - FALLING TOWARDS THE ROCKS!  Tannis looks at Lilith, who shrugs. What can you do...  Lilith white knuckles, holding the wheel. Concentrating.  Tiny Tina screams - and at the last second they ALL PUT THEIR  HANDS OUT - AND IN A FLASH OF LIGHT, THE BUS DISAPPEARS.  Everyone runs up to watch the bus fall...and disappear in a  flash. Roland cheers, ecstatic. Steele fumes.  Steele ZAPS HIM with a taser, knocking him out.  Two Lance soldiers pick him up. Steele looks below, not  understanding how they got away. Where are they...  *NOTE - If we are in budget crisis mode, they can teleport in  the mine when they are about to crash into the roof. Roland's  sacrifice would be holding up a wall so they can escape.*  We’re in a FRIGID SWIRL of frozen air driven by howling wind.  The landscape is snow and ice, flat and cold as far as the  eye can see. AURORA PANDORALIS swirls across the sky.  A solitary BULLYMONG stumbles into frame, its face coated  with ice... then it keels over and dies, frozen stiff.  Then, about three feet above the snowy ground... a DOME OF  PURPLE ENERGY crackles into view... EXPANDS... and then...  Lilith, Tina, Tannis, Krieg, and Claptrap appear in the bus,  NOSE FIRST. But still three feet above the-- aaaaand they  all just fell. The bus falls back onto its wheels, crushing  them.  The door opens. Everyone stumbles out of the bus, shocked.  Teleportation whaaaaaat? I MOVE STUFF  WITH MY MIND YALLLLL!  Lilith stumbles out, and, oh god. Nope. Doubles over. Pukes.  THE TINY ONE AND THE SAD-FACED MOTHER!  (they turn to him)  Then he points back to-- A CAVE ENTRANCE. Shelter!  SWEET! Gonna grab me some primo-ass  NAPTIME!  She goes BOUNDING happily toward the cave. Tannis and  Claptrap follow. Lilith watches Tina go. The girl is special.  It's all real. The Vault. The Key. The Daughter of Eridea.  The Treasure Beyond Treasure. Her mother's faith.  A natural shelter from the storm. Krieg stokes small fire  with his own hand. Good Lord.  TINA - snores softly on the ground, where she's basically  face-planted. Hard to blame her. Busy day.  TANNIS - in a deeper part of the cave, out of earshot from  Krieg, has the TWO KEY PIECES. Lilith watches as Tannis fits  them together. They slide into each other perfectly, joint in  groove, and snap together with a CLICK. They are now one. A  single CONICAL SHAPE. Then she just stares at it. Until:  Tannis holds the key up, so that the firelight shines against  it, casting shadows on the cave wall. As she turns it, the  light SHINES through crystals, creating strange shapes on the  wall. It almost looks like...  Lines of light converge on a single point. Lilith knew it. Pandora's gonna Pandora. Tannis looks at Lilith, puzzled in her odd, blank way.  Lilith crouches in the frigid air, trying to absorb what  she's just heard. Pandora. Miserable Pandora. Where mothers  are stolen from daughters, and little girls have to die...  Claptrap moves in gingerly and NUDGES her with his-- WHAP!  She slaps his dumb claw away.  He hands over-- THE COMMUNICATOR. Good as new. Shivering,  Lilith slowly reaches out and takes it. Her gears turning.  Yes. This is the only way. She gets up from the snow, turns,  and heads into the cave.  But there's no one there. Just the dead BULLYMONG, with one  frozen-open eye staring blankly at him.  Lilith marches straight past Krieg, who mutters over his  fire. Straight past Tannis, who is drawing a map based on the  key shadows. A glance at Tina, who sleeps. Then she keeps  going. Deeper into the cave.  The spark of a FLARE. Lilith tosses it in, illuminating a  dank space. She looks back. Yeah. No one is going to hear her  in here. She takes the communicator out. A breath... then  PRESSES THE BUTTON. A moment, then... STATIC, and-- SHHHHHhshssss. The static disappears. And then: ATLAS appears in the cave. Right there. Well, a hologram. But the tech is quite impressive. SWITCH IN POV - someone arriving at the entrance to this INNER CAVE. Looking in at Lilith and the holographic ATLAS. ON LILITH - staring in impotent shock at Atlas, who then DISAPPEARS in a shimmer of light. Lilith hangs her head for a moment, then senses a presence. She turns to see: TINA - who heard that last bit, and only that last bit. We can see the betrayal etched on her face. And a dark rage.  Krieg steps out from the shadows and knocks Lilith out with  his weapon. They look at her for beat, then step out.  BLACK.  A flat gritty salt bed as far as they eye can see. Until we  find: an abandoned MOBILE MINING VEHICLE, Crimson Lance logo  painted on it. This is their fortress. The "Crimson Fastness."  A makeshift brig. Armed Lancers stand at attention around--  ROLAND - whose armor has been removed. He's CHAINED BY HIS  ARMS to a steel pipe that runs along the ceiling. Oh, and  he’s currently GETTING THE SHIT BEAT OUT OF HIM BY TWO LANCE  SOLDIERS. Rocky in the meat locker.  Steele steps in. They stop.  The soldiers leave them alone. When they're gone, she dabs  his face with a handkerchief.  WHAM! Steele puts everything into this punch. She walks out,  leaving him chained, coughing.  POV - Blurry - from Lilith, on the ground, by a fire. As it  comes into focus she sees TWO PSYCHOS, bundled up in Skag  furs, finishing chaining Claptrap to the back of their  vehicle. His friend would answer, but he just got shot in the FACE. BLAM. Knocked out of frame before we could even see any gnarly shit that would push us into an R rating. LILITH, half-emerged from the rubble, gun aimed at: THE REMAINING PSYCHO, who raises his-- nope. BOOM. Down he goes. Lilith staggers to her feet. Banged up. Cold. But breathing. Lilith limps over to one of the Psychos. Takes his Skag fur.  Lilith PEELS OUT, dragging the chained CLAPTRAP behind her  like a string of cans on a wedding limo. As the car speeds  across the frozen icescape...  Roland’s still hanging from his chains. Larry facing him,  holding up some sharp tools.  Larry and the other Lances laugh. Roland's only got eyes for  one thing in the room: that KEY RING on the guard’s waist...  Larry pops a stick, CHEWS OBNOXIOUSLY. Taunting Roland.  Then he shares Roland’s gum with EVERY GUARD IN THE ROOM.  They all chew and laugh. Roland just counts silently to  himself. 18... 19... 20...  BOOM!...... BOOMBOOMBOOM!!! We don’t see it, because that  would be NC-17 material, but you can guess what happened by  the BLOOD that just splattered all over Roland and--  TING! What was that? Ah, the GUARD’S KEYS landing at Roland’s  feet, his chains broken. Roland smiles. Still got it.  He unchains himself with his free hand, and then picks up a  radio from the guard's belt. He tunes in...  ...moving all his forces deeper into  Lilith finally arrives at the gates of Krom's Canyon. Stops  her vehicle. From behind her--  She turns back to see Claptrap... still CHAINED behind her.  He's been hard-towed this entire time. Deserved it, too.  Lilith gets out and looks around. Weirdly, not a soul there.  She unchains Claptrap.  LOOKING DOWN on Lilith and Claptrap trekking through the  canyon on foot (and wheel). It's brutally quiet.  Up ahead... A DEAD VILLAGE - a settlement of derelict homes.  And there's no sound except Lilith's breathing.  She looks across at a house. Missing door. Broken glass. She  stops, a little trepidation.  Lilith walks through. Claptrap follows. She hasn't seen this  place since she was Tina's age. Since her mother was alive.  And now... it's a ruin. Like her.  She stops at the entrance to a small room, then enters. Faded  yellow and blue on the walls. Broken remnants of toys. Near  the rotting wood of her old bed, there's a TEDDY BEAR. Lilith  bends down to pick it up. It's a lot like the one Tina was  carrying around. Odd, how close they are.  And then something catches Lilith's eyes-- under the bed. She  pulls it out. It's a SMALL TIN with a crude drawing on it. A  drawing of a SHAPE. The same shape on Lilith's arm.  She OPENS the tin. Inside... FOLDED PAPER. DRAWINGS. We saw  these in Lilith's fuzzy memories when she first landed here.  Lilith looks at the first one. A 5-year old's self-portrait  in crayon. "LILITH." Then another one of her and her mother.  They stand smiling under the Pandoran Sun/Moon.  Lilith smiles at these forgotten glimpses of a childhood she  can barely remember... Then she looks at the last drawing,  and her blood runs cold. We do not see it. Just the shock on  her face. And the dawning revelation of something enormous.  In an instant, she understands everything. She knows why her  mother stayed. She knows why she is the way she is. She knows  that she has to find Tina as quickly as possible...  She drops the picture and RUNS out. Claptrap hesitates,  confused, then follows... As we hear the sound of their  vehicle roar, we drift down to the edge of the drawing left  there on the floor. The drawing we still cannot yet see...  Back with Tina, Tannis, and Krieg. They move SLOWLY. It's  deathly quiet here. On either side of them: DIORAMAS OF  DEATH. Strange SCENES made of dead bodies, all pinned in  place by spears or chunks of petrified trees. Don't freak  out. It's more Pirates of the Caribbean scary than Saw scary.  Let the production designer wow you. On cue, more corpses re-animate. Tannis JUMPS. PSYCHOS start popping out of nooks and crannies from above them on the rocks. Salivating over these three juicy steaks who just waltzed right onto their grill. Krieg notices. Tina heaves a grenade up on the ridge and they HAUL ASS. The Psychos jump down the rocks, loving the cat and mouse. More appearing by the second. It’s not looking good until-- --Tina spots Roland SPEEDING TOWARDS THEM. Piloting a hijacked CRIMSON LANCE STINGRAY HOVERCRAFT. Swag on one trillion. They land heavy on the other side, too heavy, just as -- BOOM! -- Tina’s Christmas presents detonate behind them. But the victory is short-lived. Roland can’t keep control of the hovercraft. He jumps off as it crashes. Roland shoots, but more to help them run for cover. They back away, into a wall. All but Tannis, who stays, staring at the cliff face. But... from this exact spot... THE ROCKS FORM the OPTICAL ILLUSION of an ARCH. And in front of the arch, a short rock with a small CRACK in it just big enough for a shard to fit. Like a KEY. The others join her and see it, mesmerized. But then, A RUMBLING. Remember those Psychos? Well, they caught up. And this time they brought the whole family: THE PSYCHO ARMY - in their vehicles, marching on foot, sitting on harnessed skags, and led by: KROM - roided up via experimental Atlas super-solider serum, Colonel-Kurtz-bald, a Goliath among men. Steering at the helm of the... oh boy, gear-heads and car nerds, here comes: THE BADASSASAURUS - a vehicular nightmare made of two huge tanks Siamese-Twinned together, enormous EXHAUST PIPES spewing thick smoke behind it, and an articulated TURRET rising up from the middle... holding a FIRE-BREATHING METAL T- REX HEAD... because THIS IS PANDORA AND THIS IS ACT THREE AND EVERYTHING IS ABOUT TO GO TO ELEVEN. It's true. They've stopped. Assembled, weapons out, ready for the slaughter, but that's it. Krom sits back...and LAUGHS. They look up as the FOG CLEARS to reveal... the BIG A in the sky, and descending rapidly from it... THE ATLAS WARSHUTTLE... about the size of the dropship he sent Lilith in. Tina steps back. This is whom she fears the most. Father. The ship LANDS, and Atlas emerges. Alone. He stands there between Krom's army and Tina. Then and Krom exchange a serious nod, then... he beams a smile at Tina, all charm. Tina pulls out a HAND-ROCKET. Wraps the Key to it with a strip of torn cloth. Tina smiles: Gotcha, "dad." He gestures to Krom, who understands immediately. Krom slams his fist down on a BUTTON at the helm of his Badassasaurus, and two SPEAR- HEADED CHAINS FIRE OUT of the T-Rex head and PIERCE KRIEG, who is instantly YANKED OFF HIS FEET as the chains retract back, dragging him toward the PSYCHOS. Atlas smiles. Good. It's working. Of course it's working. KROM slams his fist down on another button, and the T-Rex head BELCHES FIRE DOWN, singing Krieg in a cloud of HEAT. Tina tries to rush to Krieg's side. No fear of the heat. But Roland restrains her as the mighty Krieg struggles in vain to free himself from the chains. The Psychos LAUGH at him as Krom blasts him with another belch of FLAME. Atlas doesn't even bother looking at her. He just watches the sport of Krieg's torture. Another BLAST of fire. Krieg is moving slower. Losing will. He's not burning, he's melting.  TINY TINA  STOPSTOPSTOP, I'LL OPEN IT! Atlas puts his hand up. Krom stops... The chains release and Krieg drops. Exhausted, but alive. Our gang in shock. Roland relents. Stuck between a rock and a hard place. Atlas grins: Gotcha, "daughter." Tina stares at him, enraged. But he's beaten her. She puts the rocket away, takes the key in hand, and walks slowly to the KEYHOLE ROCK. ATLAS - watches in greedy anticipation. TANNIS - watches too. Emotionless as always. Curiosity more than anything else. The final secret. Roland grits his teeth. Tina stops in front of the keyhole. Looks at the KEY in her hand. Back at Atlas. He nods to her. Finish your task. She raises the KEY high... gives out a mighty YELL... and... SLAMS THE KEY INTO THE KEYHOLE! Silence. No sound. Just a huge Psycho army and a Psycho Lord and Tannis and Roland and Krieg and Atlas and... TINA. Who opens one eye. Ummm... is it open? Looks at the key in the hole. Looks at the entrance to the Vault. Nothing happened. From the ranks of the army, a Psycho starts LAUGHING and POINTING at the hilarious awkwardness of it all. Atlas, unamused, gestures to Krom, who gestures to another Psycho, who immediately SHOOTS the laughing Psycho in the back. Tina is pulling the key out and sticking it back in. Nothing. Tannis watches Tina. Gears turning. Roland stares, confused.  Which way is clockwise again? "Echo  echo echo?" Atlas rubs his eyes. Headache. Disappointment. But he's already walking to his ship. Calls back to Krom. Krom nods to his men. Three Psycho brutes start walking toward a terrified Tina. Roland steps up, ready for the worst. And then: Everyone LOOKS UP. LILITH stands at the top of the CANYON. A lone hero set against the sun/moon. The Queen of Awesomeness. KROM turns his helmeted face at Lilith, the way he did all those years ago... Lilith SLIDES DOWN the banked cliffside, landing on the ground like a cat. Then rises up. Eyes on Atlas. She starts walking to Tina. And as she does, she drops her gun to the ground. Then her other gun. Then her ammo belt. Until she's completely disarmed. What is she doing? Atlas laughs.  She stands next to Tina.  Lilith reaches out and takes the KEY from Tina. The first  time she's held the assembled key... and she holds it high.  Behold. THE GROOVES IN THE KEY begin to GLOW. Like purple  fire in the stone. Lilith exhales. She wasn't sure that would  work. But it did.  FLASH TO - the DRAWING on the floor of Lilith's home. A  little stick figure girl drawn in crayon... making PURPLE  SWIRLS in the air... domes of energy...  BACK TO SCENE - Lilith looks down at her forearm. The mark...  is GLOWING.  Tina stares in shock. But... she's the special one... Atlas  takes a step forward. Eyes lit up in desire. Yes. YES.  and she lives. NOBODY HURTS THE GIRL.  Krom nods. Lilith looks to Atlas, nods okay. She turns to  the KEYHOLE... but TINA gets in between her and the rock.  FLASH OF HER MEMORY - the bus falls - Tina screams, and next  to her... Lilith is screaming NO in a rage... the rage of a  mother protecting a daughter...  BACK TO SCENE - It was Lilith? It was Lilith all along?  ON ATLAS - he steps forward, growing impatient, clapping  twice, but Krieg looks at him and growls... as if to say,  "C'mon man, give them a moment."  Lilith looks to Roland. Finally understanding.  Tina smiles. Lilith tries too, but it's hard to keep up the  facade. Tina's smile fades in response. Something's wrong.  It takes Tina a moment. And then she does. No... She looks to  Tannis, who nods. It's true. And Tina's little heart breaks.  She had Lilith for a moment, and now she's leaving. Forever. Lilith stands up. Roland comes over to take Tina's hand... to keep her back and let Lilith do what she has to do. Lilith walks toward the KEYHOLE. Looks back to her friends. They nod. There's a tear in Krieg's eye. Tina nods, taking that quite seriously, even as the tears trickle down her cheeks. And that's it. Nothing more to be said. Lilith walks to the KEYHOLE. Lilith lifts the KEY, raises it high... Then... she SLAMS THE KEY DOWN into the HOLE, and... THE SPACE WITHIN THE ARCH – EXPLODES IN A PURPLE LIGHT. It PENETRATES through Lilith’s BODY... The purple glow nearly blinds everyone. Lilith SCREAMS in AGONY... the energy literally LIFTING HER OFF THE GROUND... FLOWING THROUGH HER, pouring from her eyes, her mouth... INSIDE THE GATE – ANOTHER DIMENSION APPEARS! THE VAULT! ...a final terrible SCREAM from LILITH... THE ENERGY DISSIPATES... and Lilith’s body FALLS TO THE GROUND. Eyes open. No focus. The mark on her arm glows no more. She's dead. Atlas strides forward into the OPEN VAULT... some kind of extra-dimensional space that has been revealed. An echoing, otherwordly chamber of SWIRLING LIGHT AND ENERGY. It's beautiful...  Behind him, Tina rushes over to Lilith's dead body. Tries to  revive her. But it's pointless. Dead is dead, and she's  really dead. Seriously. Stop thinking she isn't. She is.  Claptrap wheels over. Looks down at Lilith's body.  As he starts rolling away...  IN THE VAULT - Atlas enters. In the middle of the room, there  is a small CHEST. No lock. Yes. At last... all of the years,  all of the money, all of the lives burned... for this.  Behind him, Tannis and Krieg crane their necks to see. Behind  THEM... Krom and his army keep their weapons aimed at our  heroes. No chance for last minute heroics. Atlas puts his  hands on the chest... flips the lid open and... INSIDE IS....  Nothing. Nothing at all.  What the fuck? He runs his hands in and out of the space. No.  It can't be. Nothing? NOTHING? After all this?  The Psychos look at each other. They may be crazy, but this  dude is nuuuuuuts....  WILL ENSLAVE EVERY LAST MAN, WOMAN  AND CHILD ON PANDORA IF I HAVE TO! I  WILL CRACK THIS PLANET IN TWO!  Tina stares in shock and horror at what Atlas is saying.  Everyone on Pandora is in terrible danger.  That's probably why she doesn't notice: THE MARK ON LILITH’S  ARM ... begins to GLOW. A faint purple...  then more intense... ...and then the MARK GROWS, crawling up  Lilith’s arm in SWIRLS AND LOOPS...  And now Tina sees it. She backs away from Lilith. What’s  happening? The swirling tattoo-like marks glow brighter and  brighter... turning from PURPLE to ORANGE.  And that's as far as he gets with that, because there's a  SHADOW moving on the wall... some light source coming from--?  LILITH - the swirls on her skin glowing orange...  TANNIS - steps forward... yes... of course. How could she have  missed it all along?  Lilith's EYES SNAP OPEN, and they are FIRE. Orange flame. Tina  scrambles back to Krieg, terrified. Roland watches, awestruck.  Atlas' jaw hangs. The Psychos stare in shock.  Lilith RISES to her feet. No, not Lilith. I told you she was  dead, and she is. This isn't Lilith anymore.  She is... FIREHAWK. We're still going to call her Lilith,  because we can. But like the drawing, SHE. IS. FIREHAWK.  Lilith fists clench... she straightens... and WINGS OF FIRE  sprout from her back as she assumes her ultimate form.  What's happening?  The power inside the Vault has been set free, transforming the  once Daughter of Eridea into an avenging ANGEL.  IN THE CAVE with the blind girl - her picture GLOWS. Her  eyes can SEE again. Her smile growing, in total awe.  IN THE GARBAGE OF PANDORA - The kids feel the ground rumble,  light glowing in the sky. They watch, stunned. She's HERE.  Lilith rises into the air with beats of her flaming wings,  and turns her burning gaze onto... ATLAS. Who is smart enough  to know this is about to get very, very, kinda sorta bad.  That's all Krom need to hear. He slams his fist down on a  button, and the BADASSASAURUS LURCHES FORWARD, spitting FIRE,  and the PSYCHO ARMY CHARGES... FIRING EVERYTHING AT LILITH  AND TINA AND TANNIS AND ROLAND AND KRIEG, AND:  LILITH spins to face them, and instantly creates an ORANGE  ENERGY DOME around her and her friends... stopping the  bullets dead. The Psychos stop firing. It's Lilith's turn.  And NOW the BATTLE FOR PANDORA begins.  Rather than spell it all out beat by beat, let me give you  the high points. Lilith can:  PHASEWALK – instantaneous movement through another dimension,  allowing her to traverse distances in the blink of an eye, or  teleport someone else at will.  Which means she's BEHIND the enemy, attacking them from the  rear, and when they TURN to face her, she's not there... and  now she's FLANKING THEM... and when they fire at her friends,  she's instantly moving them through space as well...  PHASELOCK – lock a Psycho in a bubble of energy, trapping  them helplessly in mid-air... and then SLAM them down into  their fellow Psychos, which is particularly fun when one of  them is wearing something explosive like a flamethrower  backpack or a cooking grenade...  But when you're facing an army of a THOUSAND PSYCHOS, you  need what we nerds like to call an "area of effect" attack.  You know. Something that covers some space. Like:  PHASESTRIKE – a concussive ENERGY BLAST that blows enemies  backwards, smashing their bones and rendering them gooey. THE PROTECTIVE ENERGY DOME - It’s keeping most of the horde out, but the truly insane are muscling through in ones and twos. Roland switches from one target to the next. His rifle spitting lead. Krieg takes out a WHOLE BUNCH OF RAGE on the Psychos who left him for dead. That big ol' sawbladefootclub of his is connecting with a LOT of skulls. Tina tosses grenades like party favors. Even Tannis pops a few caps in a few asses. Claptrap does impressive karate chops. Who knew? WITH LILITH - in the middle of the chaos, when she hears... She turns quickly to Tina... eyes flaming with concern. But Tina is not in trouble. What she IS is TINY TINA, THE WORLD'S DEADLIEST 13 YEAR-OLD, and she's got a whole mess of SWEET BABIES that need delivering to a bunch of Psychos... Oh yeaaaaaah. Fire-eyed Lilith, goddess of flame and retribution, SMILES. That's a sweet idea. Tina heaves baby after baby into the air like rice at a wedding. Lilith force- catching each, flinging them into the horde. The bombs make for a great light show. And a ton of severed limbs. But there’s a looooot of Psychos out here. And they’re weighing hard on Lilith’s protective forcefield. She phasewalks back inside, beside Roland. The light flickers on the force field. Lilith losing strength. More psychos come. Even with Lilith’s new awe-inspiring power, she can’t attack and play defense at the same time. This is about to be Hollywood’s shortest climax, if not for: THE CRIMSON LANCE - arriving in force, the very militia that used to serve Atlas, now turned against him!  They cut down Psychos by the dozen from atop their Stingrays  and Outrunners. And at the front of the pack... STEELE.  BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM and they FIRE AT KROM'S PSYCHOS.  WITH ROLAND - as he realizes what just happened. A grin.  Then, with renewed vigor, he turns back to the fight.  WITH ATLAS - seeing the tide begin to turn. What are they  doing???? He scowls, stalks up the ramp of his ship, already  calculating the net fiscal losses from this misadventure.  Lilith suddenly blinks in front of him, blocking his path.  Before he can get a word in -- WOOMP! -- Lilith hits him with  a CONCUSSIVE BLAST, sending him skidding into the dirt.  Atlas has never felt pain like this before. Been a while  since anyone’s dared lay a finger on him. He wipes the blood  from his nose, shocked. Then... pissed. He stands. Dusts his  million dollar jacket.  WOOMP! This one knocks him right to the vault. But now when  he looks up, there’s fear in his eyes. He backpedals on his  ass away from Lilith, into the vault.  In the thick of it. The gang’s still fighting. Claptrap  karate chops Psychos like a Cuisinart.  ROLAND - has found his way to Steele, mid-fight.  They shoot psychos, fighting back to back, like old times.  Tannis sketches a quick calculation, not shooting anyone.  She fires at a rock that causes a LANDSLIDE, CRUSHING A GANG  OF PSYCHOS.  AWESOME! I WANNA TRY MATH!  Lilith looms over Atlas. He’s reached stage 3: BARGAINING.  That makes her smirk. Her fist glows a brilliant orange as  she powers up. Tired of his shit.  As she WINDS UP FOR THE FINISHING BLOW-- she senses something  behind her-- DUCKS JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME-- as a CHAINSAW  MACE (figure it out) flies right over her head.  She turns. Because now she's standing face to face with KROM.  Lilith doesn’t wait for the bell. She blinks behind Krom in  an instant, but with a little glitching. But Krom BLOCKS THAT  SHIT. Inhumanly fast. Lilith's energy dropping.  Back outside, Roland and the Crimson Lance mop up the rest of  the Psychos as the last one flee. Claptrap throws a toilet.  In the vault, it’s a different story. Krom doesn’t have  statues all over Pandora for nothing. One big swing of his  chainsaw mace sends Lilith to the ground.  As Krom towers over Lilith, ready to lay the hammer -- BOOM! --  an explosion against his back makes him stumble. Tina’s in the  vault. Terrified but standing her ground.  She chucks another grenade, but he SWATS IT LIKE A FLY. Three  huge steps and he’s there, slapping her to the ground. Yeesh. Krom cracks his neck. Gets ready for surgery. Tina looks to Lilith, not as a precocious bad-ass... but as a little girl. Tina lights a lighter. Krom laughs, holding his flamethrower. Then... FLAMES flicker around Lilith's skin... her tattoos growing WHITE HOT - as she absorbs the elements from Tina's lighter... and as Krom goes for the kill... KROM HEATS UP. He takes off his helmet. He's YOUNG, and really, really out of shape. Atlas is shocked. Lilith doesn't care. She just keeps cooking him. His suit almost melting.  I KILLED THE OTHER GUY AND TOOK HIS HE EXPLODES.. Flames emanate from Lilith like some divine aura. She just went THROUGH Krom... Then her attention falls on Atlas... But Lilith just powers down. Tattoos still glowing, she picks Tina up. And Tina hugs her neck like the kid she is. Tina nods. Then, hand in hand, they head for the exit. As Lilith crosses the threshold that leads back to Pandora, she finally turns around. Smiles sardonically. And with that, she TAKES THE KEY FROM THE VAULT DOOR...  ... and CLOSES THE VAULT. Trapping Atlas inside.  Lilith turns to Tina, smiles. Then crushes the key in her  hand. The gang approaches. Lilith clocks Steele’s presence.  Tannis examines her glowing tattoos--  There's a whirring sound, and then:  Lilith's blood chills. She knows that voice. She turns slowly  and sees:  CLAPTRAP - in a strange rigid pose. An image is being  projected out of his eye. A woman's face. She’s bloody.  Dying, actually.  Lilith’s Mother, in an alley, on her last legs. Krom’s blast  didn’t kill her. At least not right away.  Psychos run rampant in the distance. She finds a spot near a  trash heap. Good a place as any to die.  As her eyes grow heavy, they fall on something in the trash  heap... An old Hyperion CL4P-TP robot.  LATER - Lilith’s Mother has wrested its BACK PANEL open.  Using the last of her strength to re-jigger its wires. Now we  notice she has the SAME TATTOO as Lilith.  Then... we see CLAPTRAP’S LIGHT FLICKER ON...  Lilith, looking at the hologram of her mother’s face. So  close she could touch her. If only. Her eyes water...  Tina joins Lilith and takes her hand.  The image DISAPPEARS. And Claptrap regains whatever his  version of consciousness is. Lilith hangs her head. Unbelievable. CLOSE ON LILITH, listening to: She nods. Yes. That is what she is. Hope. And... Wait. I'm sorry, who the fuck was saying that? Lilith turns and sees... KRIEG. And then, in Lilith's head, she hears: Krieg drops his club. Falls to his knees. Overwhelmed. And yells to the sky: Everyone looks at each other. What was that? They sit, Tina, in between Lilith and Roland, Krieg on one side, Steele the other. Claptrap wheels over, and Krieg pets him like a dog. Even Tannis comes by, pouring a cup of tea for Tina. No idea where the fuck that came from. And Tina looks around...at her family. A tear in her eye. Then... A HONK. A brand new BANDIT TECHNICAL rolls up with MOXXI, SCOOTER and ELLIE behind the wheel. And with them, MARCUS in his bus. Ellie, Moxxi and Scooter hop out of the Bandit Technical. Marcus reaches in his bag, and tosses her a Maliwan. She spins it around an holsters it. Lilith smiles at Tina. Ready? Yeah. She's ready. Lilith takes her by the hand, and FIREHAWK AND TINY TINA phaseshift through time and space... a glorious streak of FIRE across the sky... and my friends, I'm so sorry to say it, but this is:  THE END.
