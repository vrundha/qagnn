 Current Draft by Jon Gunn  CLOSE ON A TV: JOE MONTANA drives down field in Super Bowl  XIX for the San Francisco 49ers.  TWO BOYS sit in front of a small TUBE TV. KURT (9), energetic  and athletic, is glued to the screen, watching Montana’s  every move. His brother, MATT (11), glasses and a natural  bookworm, huffs as he watches. Mildly interested.  Sports TROPHIES cover the humble walls and shelves.  THE GAME ENDS. The 49ers WIN. Kurt fixes his eyes on the  screen. On the celebration. On Montana -- and the number on  the back on his jersey: #16. Then:  DUCT TAPE on the back of an old t-shirt doubling for a  jersey. The tape forms the number 13, with the name WARNER  above it. Kurt smooths out the shirt, looks it over with a  smile, and a dream. Then:  A brisk mid-western day. IN THE YARD, Matt lines up as wide  receiver. Kurt calls HIKE, then narrates his Super Bowl win.  Warner drops back. He rolls left.  Sees his man. Time running out  THROWS. But Matt breaks right instead of left and the ball  DROPS in the grass. Kurt throws his hands in the air.  Matt HUFFS toward the house, done.  Matt sits in front of the TV. Switches the dial to Channel 3  and plays COMBAT on ATARI.  THUMP! The football hits the wall outside and the TV goes  STATICKY.  Another THUMP!  Kurt hurls the ball again. WHAM!  A beat up Honda Accord sputters into the driveway. Kurt’s  mother SUE (30s) climbs out. Weary and tired, she wears a  work uniform and carries grocery bags.  Kurt runs to her, wrapping his arms around her. It’s obvious  how much he loves her.  Kurt and Matt clear space on the cluttered table for dinner.  Mom pulls TV dinners from the oven with one hand, sifting  through PAST DUE bills with the other.  Sue sits at the table with the two boys. Kurt holds up a  SNEAKER, dirty and worn, a hole in the bottom.  Kurt’s already taking a bite.  Kurt digs in.  Kurt hesitates. Matt jumps in.  This triggers something in Kurt - he punches Matt in the  shoulder and Matt punches him back. Sue grabs them both.  Matt scowls at Kurt. But Kurt just stews. Then he STORMS OUT.  Mom shoots Matt a look. Then they hear it - THUMP! Against  the side of the house.  Kurt holds the FOOTBALL. Eyes blurred with tears. Sue walks  over beside him.  Kurt shakes his head. Drops the ball to the ground.  She hands him the football.  She hands the ball back to him.  She pats him on the back, then heads to her car. Thirty yards  away she stops. Turns back.  Kurt winds back, cocks his arms, and throws with everything  he’s got. AS THE BALL FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, WE:  Giant letters scroll across the screen (in homage to ROCKY):  A M E R I C A N U N D E R D O G  A FOOTBALL spirals in perfect SLOW MOTION. Finally CAUGHT by  a receiver for a 40 yard gain. The CROWD ERUPTS.  The UNI Quarterback steps to the line for the next play. BUT  it’s not who we expect. Not #13. NOT WARNER.  The camera DRIFTS beyond the action to the UNI sidelines...  Past front line COACHES and players. Past DEFENSE huddling...  FINALLY settles at the distant bench. A player as far from  the game as possible. We see his Jersey: WARNER. #13.  Benchwarmer.  KURT (now 22), square jaw. Perfect archetype of a QB. Except  for the not playing part. His leg jackhammers up and down.  Impatient. He’s dying to be on the field. Looks to the  scoreboard: IT’S LATE IN THE GAME. They’re losing.  The UNI QB runs off the field after a three and out,  frustrated. Argues with HEAD COACH ALLEN, making excuses.  Kurt stands and calls out.  Coach Allen trades a glance with him. Then looks the other  way and the moment is over.  Kurt is the last guy in the locker room. He clutches a  PAYPHONE in the corner.  Kurt sighs, frustrated. Leans against the wall in silhouette.  A college jock apartment. Beer-stained couches, clothes  everywhere, neon Bud Light sign on the wall. ON THE FLOOR, Kurt sits in front of a stack of VCRs strapped to a mini TV. He toggles through GAME FOOTAGE, trying to cut together a reel. Kurt’s roommate emerges from his room in a plaid shirt and cowboy boots. This is MIKE HUDNUTT (22). Six feet, 250 pounds wide, Kurt’s best friend and anchor of the offensive line. Mike holds up two giant belt BUCKLES. Kurt turns back to the VCR. Scrolls through: NUMBER 13, in his Panther uniform, dropping back and firing a bullet.  A country western bar. Flashing neon sign reads: “WILD E.  COYOTE”. Underneath it hangs a “LADIES NIGHT” banner.  Mike’s Monster truck pulls into the parking lot, country  music BLASTING from the stereo. In the passenger seat, Kurt  SIGHS.  Kurt steps into the smokey dive bar. He cringes, eyeing the  giant DANCE FLOOR where dozens of cowgirls and cowboys are  smack in the middle of a LINE DANCE.  Kurt shakes his head, instantly miserable. Mike slaps him on  the back...  And heads off to greet his friends, leaving Kurt by himself.  Looking very out of place in a t-shirt, jeans and sneakers.  As Mike stomps into the dancing crowd, Kurt heads straight  for the bar. Within seconds, every BLONDE seems to be eyeing  him. But Kurt can’t be bothered.  LATER, the dancing continues, but Kurt hasn’t budged. He just  sips his beer, ignoring the women circling him. Then he looks  to the DANCE FLOOR and his gaze lands on:  ONE GIRL. In the middle of the action. Short skirt, cowboy  boots and spikey dark hair. She’s brash and badass and funny  all at the same time. This is BRENDA MEONI (25).  Brenda dances with a HELL’S ANGEL three times her age, then  spins away and joins a skinny rodeo guy, then moves on again,  from guy to guy, but not flirting -- it’s all about the  dancing. And SHE’S GREAT AT IT. She lights everyone up around  her, and Kurt is immediately captivated.  He steps closer, watching her. Then Brenda turns his way and  THEIR EYES MEET...  And for just a split-second... EVERYTHING SEEMS TO STOP. The  room goes quiet. Kurt is locked in. Doesn’t even blink.  Brenda meets his gaze, curious.  Kurt takes a step toward her on the DANCE FLOOR when:  Everyone scrambles, guys in one line facing girls in another.  Hudnutt included. And Brenda still right in the middle of it  all. Kurt retreats, back to the bar. Total fish out of water.  But he keep his eye locked on Brenda. Who is this girl??  MID-PRACTICE. Kurt drops back in the pocket. He looks up to  see the DEFENSE RUSHING HIM. And he panics. Kurt SCRAMBLES  BACK.  Kurt dodges to the sideline, but still makes a stellar throw.  Caught 25 yards downfield. Kurt looks to the coach. Not  impressed.  AFTER PRACTICE, Kurt faces off with the Coach. Frustrated.  Coach walks away. Kurt chase after.  Kurt steps in front of him, defiant.  Coach studies Kurt. This kid. But there IS a fire in him.  THEN:  WHAM! Kurt gets SLAMMED hard by a MASSIVE DEFENSIVE END. He  hits the ground. Looks to the coach in confusion.  Kurt shakes it off and lines up for a snap. Hike! Drops back  in the pocket and WHAM!!! Taken down again.  MOMENTS LATER... WHAM!! Another BRUTAL hit.  NEXT ONE - Kurt gets off a haphazard throw, but still gets  drilled to the ground.  Hands go up everywhere, including HUDNUTT.  And... BAM! Kurt goes down again.  He wills himself off the ground.  Mike and Kurt push their cart from the market, loaded up on  chips and donuts. Mike already chows down on a bag of Nachos.  Kurt limps along, sore, leaning on the cart. They pass a  STOCK BOY, hard at work unpacking a pallet. Mike nudges Kurt.  He slaps Kurt on the back. Kurt winces. Glancing one more  time at the stock boy. As they approach Mike’s truck:  Kurt stops and turns.  And sure enough, Mike LAUGHS. Loud. Milking it. Finally...  MOMENTS LATER The groceries are in the flatbed but the stereo  is BLASTING Tim McGraw. Mike leads Kurt through the Barn  Dance moves. Mike is still laughing. The stock boy watches  them, like “What in the literal hell?”  Kurt still wears his normal jeans and t-shirt, but this time  he’s sporting one of Mike’s giant belt buckles. Mike GRINS.  Kurt ignores him, scanning the crowd for Brenda. He steps up  to the bar, nods to the bartender, who’s also the DJ.  The bartender looks at him, deadpan. Kurt glances behind the  bar to a pin up CALENDAR and he does a double take. It’s  Brenda. On the calendar. In a bright red shirt, jean shorts  and big boots - “Miss August”.  Then he hears her voice and turns... THERE SHE IS. On the  dance floor, as always. Brenda spots him, too. As if she was  hoping. He drops a five on the bar. The bartender glances at Brenda. He gets it. A SONG STARTS and Brenda jumps into position. Kurt quickly steps over, joins the line of men, facing off with the women. He does his best to keep up, using the moves Mike taught him, but his attention is mainly on getting to Brenda. Kurt cheats a few times, skipping the girl he’s supposed to do-si-do with, messing up the dance a bit, until finally -- He is FACE to FACE with her. Brenda raises an eyebrow. He smiles. So does she. Kurt takes her by the hand and they dance. He struggles to do the steps properly, while she is smooth as silk. She looks into his eyes. Hmm. Kurt is getting better. It comes time for the partners to switch but he just spins past another girl and lands back in front of Brenda. Over the music: He causes another traffic jam. She just smiles and keeps dancing. LATER. AT THE BAR. Brenda drinks a dark lager. Kurt nurses a daiquiri, complete with an umbrella. Brenda eyes it, judging. She nods. Okay. He motions to the calendar. She laughs and nearly spits her beer. Kurt nods. Deal. She grabs his hand and pulls him back to the DANCE FLOOR. MOMENTS LATER they’re LINE DANCING this time. Except Kurt is facing the wrong way. Backwards. Looking right at Brenda. He’s confident now, doesn’t care about the moves. He’s being a ham, and everyone buys in. Except Brenda, who rolls her eyes. She steps forward and turns Kurt back around to face the right way. AND NOW IT’S MIDNIGHT. They’re slow dancing. And Kurt is very happy about it. The place has mostly cleared out. The night belongs to them. A slower song begins -- ‘Fishin’ in the Dark’ by Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Brenda perks up.  Kurt pulls her even closer. Brenda rests her head on his  shoulder.  Brenda smiles, then lifts her head to look Kurt in the eye.  It’s electric. Finally...  Brenda leans closer into him. They almost kiss, THEN -- the  house lights start blinking.  She pulls away and heads straight for the back entrance.  Kurt catches up to Brenda as she opens the door to her rusty,  1979 Buick Regal. Two car seats in the back.  She looks up at him. Honest.  She slides behind the wheel, starts her car and drives off.  Kurt stands, speechless, unsure what just hit him.  IN THE CAR - Brenda checks her REAR VIEW, sees Kurt still  standing there, fading off the distance. Fights the urge to  turn the car around.  Brenda enters, still in a daze. Her mom, JENNY JO (50’s),  sits in a recliner, baby JESSE (1) asleep on her shoulder.  Mom leans in, really wants the scoop. But Brenda just shrugs.  A small room, squeezed with two twin beds and a crib. Brenda  lays the baby down, then kicks off her boots, exhausted.  Brenda snuggles next to ZACK (4) in a bed too small for the  two of them. Zack feels for her hand, pulls it right over his  heart. He whispers.  Morning rush. Brenda gets the kids ready. She wears an old  robe, no makeup, hair a mess. BABY JESSE CRIES at the table.  Refuses to eat apple sauce.  Jesse unleashed more FURY. Zack rounds the corner, hand  touching the wall for guidance. It’s obvious he’s disabled,  possibly blind, but it doesn’t slow him down. He holds an old  radio in his hand.  Zack hands her the radio. Swaying back and forth.  WHAM. Apple sauce sprays all over Brenda’s robe and hair.  Jesse LAUGHS now. More sauce on the walls. THEN:  A KNOCK on the sliding glass door, covered by vertical  blinds. Brenda looks up. Totally confused.  She twists the blinds open to reveal... KURT. Smiling.  Holding a single ROSE. Brenda’s eyes go wide. What the hell??  Then she realizes what she’s wearing. She brushes her hand  through her hair. Feeling the apple sauce.  She CLOSES the blinds before he can say anything.  OUTSIDE, Kurt waits. He looks around. Fiddles with the rose.  Starting to feel pretty stupid.  Finally the blinds twist open. Kurt smiles, but NO ONE is  there. Then the door unlocks and slides open.  Kurt looks down to see... ZACK. Still holding the radio. He  reaches out and touches Kurt’s jeans. His version of seeing.  Zack smiles. Takes him by the big finger and pulls him into  the house.  Zack leads Kurt down the hallway. Kurt looks to the mess at  the kitchen table. Apple sauce still drips down the walls.  But Brenda is nowhere to be found.  ON THE MANTLE, Kurt notices PHOTOS of Brenda in full MARINE  UNIFORM.  Zack walks to the door of the bedroom, points to a radio that  sits beside the bed. It PLAYS COUNTRY MUSIC softly. Zack  walks over and taps the working radio.  Kurt peers in at the unmade beds, crammed next to each other.  Then Zack pulls him into the...  BATHROOM. Where he sets the radio on the counter. Mashing its  buttons.  Zack nods. Kurt looks it over. Spots a power cable dangling  nearby. He plugs the radio in. Adjusts the antenna. STATIC. Zack smiles. Turning the dial. Finding the same COUNTRY station. Kurt cringes at his choice of music. Zack nods. Then lays on the floor, on his back. Kurt looks toward the hallway. Where is Brenda? Then he shrugs and lays down beside Zack. Suddenly Brenda’s mom steps into the doorway, interrupting. Kurt looks up at her from the floor. Strange moment. He starts to get up but Zack grabs his arm. Keeping him on the floor. IN THE HALLWAY, Brenda emerges, looking somewhat presentable, holding Jesse. She makes eye contact with her mom, like “go away!” As they switch places, Jenny Jo takes Jess. Whispers. Brenda shoos her away, then hovers by the bathroom door. Peeks in, listening as Kurt and Zack talk. They start to get up. Brenda jolt, makes for the kitchen. Kurt emerges with Zack tugging on his hand. Brenda pretends she wasn’t eavesdropping. He holds up the rose. She takes it. Perplexed and intrigued. Zack still holds Kurt’s hand, swaying back and forth. Kurt frowns, looks to Brenda. Mark?? For some reason, that blows her away.  He heads for the door. Zack holds Brenda’s hand, too and Kurt  gets far enough away where he has to let go. It’s a moment.  Kurt steps outside. Brenda joins him. She hands him a napkin.  On it --  He smiles, holding up the napkin. Then turns and walks away.  She watches him go. Mind spinning.  WHAM! Kurt goes down in another “Kill Kurt” drill. But this  time he gets off a beautiful pass before being CRUSHED. He  hops up, clapping. YES!  Other players step up. Coach Allen watches from a distance.  GAME TIME. The opposition prepares to PUNT.  ON THE SIDELINES, Kurt is in his familiar spot, keeping the  bench warm. He eyes the Coach, watching him argue with the  STARTING QB. Suddenly, in frustration, Coach calls out: The other QB huffs away. Kurt double-takes. Kurt hops up, heads for the sideline. Coach stops him. Points to Kurt’s helmet. Still on the bench. Kurt grabs it. FIRST DOWN. Kurt takes the hike. Drops back, surveys. The pocket collapses and he gets SACKED. He gets up and looks at Coach. SECOND DOWN. Kurt HANDS OFF. The D LINE suffocates the tailback for a loss. THIRD DOWN. Kurt drops back, surveys coverage. NOTHING. And here they come. The pocket collapses -- AND KURT RETREATS. He darts left towards the sideline. Looking across the field as he goes... JUST BEFORE he runs out of bounds he leaps and throws across his body to the OTHER SIDE of the field. Fifty yards later a WIDE RECIEVER catches it for a TOUCHDOWN. A PERFECT and IMPOSSIBLE throw. The crowd goes WILD. The STARTING QB is NOT happy. But the other players gape. Even Coach raises an eyebrow. Kurt BASKS in the moment.  Brenda sits on the couch in a rare moment of peace and quiet.  She looks out the window to her father LARRY (60s), a large  blue collar man, mowing the grass. Zack rides on his  shoulders, loving every minute of it.  The phone RINGS. Brenda pulls it over by the cord. Answers.  KURT IN HIS APARTMENT. CROSS CUT.  Brenda hangs up, smirking.  Kurt labels a folder “Project NFL.” Stuffed with research on  teams, contacts, etc. Then pins a “DAYS TO THE DRAFT”  calendar on the wall. Marking a day off. Eyeing the DAY OF  DESTINY, months away. He calls out --  Kurt pulls up to Brenda’s driveway in Hudnutt’s monster  truck. He HONKS and waits. Brenda steps out, confused.  The truck is parked backwards with the bed open towards the  giant screen. Zack is in the drivers seat, pretending to  drive the truck. ‘The Sandlot’ plays loud over the stereo.  Kurt and Brenda sit in the back. Legs dangling from the truck  bed. Jesse is asleep beside them on a pile of blankets.  She nods, a little guarded.  Kurt just nods. Silent. Comfortable. He gives her a look. A nod. A challenge. She meets his gaze. Sighs. Kurt grins. Brenda hesitates, self-conscious again. Clearly not used to opening up. And not quite sure why she’s doing it now. But -- Kurt just sits silent. Listening intently. Brenda goes off into a thousand yard stare. Kurt nods to Zack in the driver’s seat. Brenda LAUGHS.  Brenda shrugs, bittersweet. Honest.  Kurt parks the truck. Walks Brenda to the house. Jesse asleep  in one of his arms, holding Zack’s hand with the other.  Brenda can’t help but notice.  ON THE PORCH, Brenda’s parents wait for them. Larry wears a  factory uniform, all blue collar grit. Jenny Jo smiles.  As Larry nods, Zack runs to him.  Brenda’s older sister KIM pops her head out. Admiring Kurt. Kurt smirks. Brenda swats everyone away. Mom takes Jesse and they go inside, leaving Brenda and Kurt alone. Kurt steps close. Brenda goes a bit quiet. Brenda rolls her eyes. And suddenly she KISSES HIM. Kurt is caught off guard for a beat. Then he wraps his arms around her and kisses her back. A long, potent kiss. Finally they pull away. Brenda catches her breath. Then:  Packed crowd. TONS OF ENERGY. Students, cheerleaders, fans.  ON THE FIELD. Kurt steps to the LINE in slow mo. Loving it.  Ball in hand. He surveys. Takes a breath. HIKE!  The bar is packed. Everyone’s eyes on the TV, watching the  game. Where Kurt is dominating. Brenda sits at the bar. Glued  to the screen.  ON THE TV: Kurt drops back. Let’s it fly. TOUCHDOWN! The bar  erupts. Brenda CHEERS. OFF THIS --  ...NOW THE FOOTAGE PLAYS ON KURT’S TV. As he cuts together a  new DEMO REEL. He ejects the tape. Labels it. Then looks to  his DRAFT calendar.  “DAY OF DESTINY” is just two months away.  Kurt holds the phone to his ear. Talking to a sports agent,  RICH. Brenda and Hudnutt listen.  Brenda leans into the phone. Her face close to his. He kisses  her quick. Mike snaps his finger and points, like “FOCUS!”.  Kurt and Brenda hold their breath. Waiting. Now Mike leans  in, too.  CLICK. Kurt looks to Brenda and Mike, in shock.  He PUMPS his fist and they all SCREAM.  Kurt pulls up to his childhood home in Hudnutt’s black truck.  Mom greets him on the porch, excited. Quick hug.  ESPN coverage plays on TV. Mom puts out a bowl of chips. LATER. Kurt paces, on the phone with his Dad. There’s a KNOCK at the door. Sue opens it to find -- BRENDA AND ZACK. Kurt jolts, surprised. Zack barrels to him. Sue watches this little disabled boy run into her house, then she nods at Brenda. A bit cold. Kurt cringes a little. Instant tension. THEY SETTLE ON THE COUCH as the draft starts. Zack walks right up to the TV, squints with his good eye. Kurt looks from Brenda to his mom. Sue’s disapproval is obvious. And here’s Kurt, literally stuck in the middle. ON THE TV - music and graphic play. Everyone HUSHES. Zack plops into Kurt’s lap. He can’t see the screen, he’s just excited to be part of it. Then PAUL TAGLIABUE, COMMISSIONER OF THE NFL, begins:  TAGLIABUE (ON SCREEN) Brenda SHUSHES him again. Kurt waves it off.  LATER. Sue does dishes, watching through the window as Kurt  helps Brenda load Zack into her old Buick Regal.  MOMENTS LATER, Kurt enters the kitchen. Sue glances at him.  She hands him a plate to dry. On Kurt... hesitating.  THE NEXT DAY, Kurt sits alone. Glued to the TV. As...  ON THE SCREEN: They announce the LAST pick of the draft. Not  Kurt Warner.  ON HIS FACE, as it sets it.  Zack’s birthday party. It’s a small affair. Just Brenda and  her parents, Kim and JOHN (Kim’s husband), little Jesse, and  a few of Zack’s preschool friends.  Kurt enters, clearly late. Brenda looks to him. Wondering...  Kurt shakes his head. Brenda slumps sympathetically.  She tries to hug him. But he shrugs it off. It stings, but  Brenda pivots to Zack.  Zack runs over. Kurt perks up for him.  LATER. Everyone chats, Larry runs Zack around the house on  his shoulders. Kurt sits off on his own, poking at a piece of  cake. Dejected. Brenda approaches.  But he’s off in his own world.  And he walks out. Brenda watches him go, disappointed. Then  thinks better of it and follows.  She chases Kurt into the driveway.  Kurt turns.  Kurt looks at her, surprised. But it’s working, she’s getting  through. Brenda continues, firm.  ON KURT. Deciding.  Brenda drives. Kurt’s next to her, in his UNI sweats. Upbeat.  Revving himself up.  She TURNS RIGHT.  Kurt tears into one of THREE CHEESEBURGERS on his plate.  Slurps a chocolate shake. NFL Folder open before him.  He’s buried in STATS of various NFL franchises. Brenda just  smirks. Admiring him.  Then A VOICE interrupts:  It’s a wondrous cross between a used car salesman and a  revival tent preacher. Kurt and Brenda spin on their stools  to face:  JIM FOSTER (late 40s) shakes Kurt’s hand up and down. Then  bows to Brenda. Foster plops down a brochure for the Barnstormers. Cheesy and small time in every way.  Foster drops four $20 bills on the table. Then he leaves,  giving one more thumbs up out the door. Brenda looks at the  cash on the table, gives Kurt a look.  Kurt and Brenda enter. Arms full with diapers and milk.  Larry, Jenny Jo and Zack sit around the dinner table.  He digs into the roast and potatoes. Doesn’t notice that  everyone is staring at him, until...  Larry clears his throat. Jenny Jo smiles. They trade looks,  like there’s a joke Kurt isn’t in on.  He stops mid-sentence, drops his fork. Looks to Larry.  Larry shakes his head, acting despondent.  A LONG BEAT as Larry milks it for all it’s worth. Finally:  Kurt’s eyes go WIDE. Jumps from his chair. Everyone YELLS all  at once. Off this, we CUT TO:  A CONTRACT. As Kurt signs his name. We pull out to reveal  we’re in:  It’s not a sports contract, he’s signing the title documents  for a new car. A SALESMAN hands him the keys to a brand new,  GREEN ‘93 GMC Jimmy.  Brenda and Hudnutt are along for moral support. Kurt beams.  Kurt and Brenda lay on the couch in the dark, kissing. Kurt  grins at her.  Kurt laughs, kisses her again, pulls his shirt over his head.  Just then... THE FRONT DOOR OPENS. Brenda’s mom steps in.  Kurt bolts up. Shoot! He looks around -- nowhere to go. So he  runs for the WINDOW. Brenda tries to stop him, but he climbs  out into the yard like a busted teenager, pulling his shirt  on and tripping over his shoes. Brenda calls after him.  Kurt is packed and ready to go. Shakes hands with Larry.  Gives Jenny Jo a hug. He bends down, picks up Zack.  Zack hugs Kurt extra tight. Clearly emotional:  Jesse FUSSES in Brenda’s arms. Brenda hands her to Mom and  they all go inside, leaving Brenda and Kurt to say goodbye.  She kisses him. Deep.  He looks into her eyes. Sees a tinge of something, maybe  fear. Something is off.  She nods. Steeling herself. But won’t make eye contact.  Processing.  Finally, she looks into his eyes. One last kiss and Kurt  climbs into his truck. Brenda watches him drive away.  Kurt’s new truck speeds through lush green Wisconsin farmland.  Kurt step into the stadium, where dozens of players warm up.  BRETT FAVRE sprays bullets around the field. Kurt’s jaw drops.  He spots REGGIE WHITE getting stretched out by a trainer.  Reggie looks over.  Kurt puts out his hand, geeking out. But Reggie is mid-  stretch. Not really a good moment to shake.  Kurt ends up sort of patting Reggie on the head. It’s really  weird. Reggie just chuckles. Kurt shakes his head,  humiliated. Such an idiot.  QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS, as Kurt is put through the wringer  with the other recruits. 7 on 7 drills, warm ups, laps, etc.  Kurt lines up behind center. Takes the snap, but before he can  look up, he’s rushed. Panicked, he throws... an incomplete.  He pats Kurt on the head the same weird way and walks off.  LATER, Kurt stands on the sideline, brow furrowed from  reading the THICK PLAYBOOK.  It’s the quarterbacks coach, STEVE “MOOCH” MARIUCCI (30’s).  Kurt hustles over.  Kurt immediately starts backpedaling.  Kurt enters Coach Mooch’s office. Mooch shakes his hand.  Kurt stops. Confused.  AT A PAYPHONE, Kurt is mid-conversation with his agent.  As that settles....  Kurt drives back, numb. Passes the sign “WELCOME TO IOWA”.  Brenda sits with Kurt. Her hand in his.  Brenda processes this. Gets a thought.  He looks at her. You kidding?  They laugh.  Kurt carries boxes to the basement. Followed by Larry, with a  port-a-crib. Then Brenda, hefting a mini-fridge. There’s a  carpet on one side, with a full-sized bed. Couch and a tv.  Larry waves it off. But Jenny Jo is clearly uncomfortable  with this. Kurt shoots Brenda a look. Told you.  Zack and Kurt sit on the couch together watching football on  TV, eating mac and cheese. Both of them loving it.  Zack nods thoughtfully. Scratches at his eyebrow. Swaying  back and forth.  He holds up one of his trucks. Kurt’s face fills with love  for this kid. He takes the truck and they start playing.  Kurt runs and runs, pushing himself. The sun rising behind  him.  LATER, he throws a worn football over and over. Keeping his  arm up. He’s not giving up.  The same market Kurt and Mike shopped at earlier on. The  cashier rings Kurt up. Diapers. Cereal. Etc.  Kurt opens his wallet, feeling the strain.  The cashier eyes him, nods reluctantly. Kurt hands over an  EBT card. Then he spots a NOW HIRING sign in the window.  He heads for the exit. Then stops, doubles back.  The basement door opens. Brenda peeks down to find:  Kurt, laid out on the carpet, Zack in his arms. Both of them  stone cold asleep. Zack has built a whole racetrack up and  around Kurt’s body, like Gulliver’s Travels.  Brenda admires them for a moment. Then gently picks up Zack  to put him to bed. Kurt stirs. Takes a breath. Opens one eye.  Brenda nods thoughtfully.  He manages a genuine smile, and her heart fills with  admiration for this man. Off this:  You need to re-set your  expectations.  Kurt sits with Brenda in tiny plastic kindergarten chairs.  Facing off with a WEARY TEACHER. Larry leans against the  wall, off to the side. Brenda is already worked up.  Brenda exchanges a look with her father. Larry raises an  eyebrow. Damn.  Kurt works with Zack -- drawing letters on a Magna-Doodle.  Zack is determined. But having trouble.  Brenda peeks in. Kurt writes something on the board.  Zack squints with his good eye. He can’t.  She looks to Kurt, surprised. Then rolls her eyes.  Kurt grins boyishly. What?? She just shakes her head and  walks out. As she goes...  Kurt wears a clerk’s apron, stocking groceries.  A WOMAN and her SON (10) push a cart past. She spots Kurt and  pauses. Whispers to her kid, who wears a UNI jersey.  Obviously recognizing him. Then her surprise turns to pity.  Kurt sees. Trying to shrug it off. But it stings.  Kurt enters, just as THE SUN RISES. Weary, he strips off his  apron. BEYOND tired.  Morning rush hour. Brenda hurries to make a bag lunch. Her  mom feeds the kids.  Kurt runs the streets. Still training. Still believing. But  WORN the hell down.  Cereal aisle. Kurt unpacks boxes of WHEATIES, each one with  the FACE of Dan Marino on it. He stares at Dan’s face. Like  “I could be that guy”.  From down the aisle, another clerk, MARSHALL, calls out.  Marshall laughs at his own joke. Kurt FLINGS a box at him,  then grins mischievously.  He pulls out a canister of Quaker Oats, then crouches behind  a pallet like he’s under center.  Marshall takes the cue, breaks long toward the seafood  Mr. Quaker spins in a perfect spiral toward Marshall’s  outstretched hands. Except DEREK, the night manager, walks by  and -- SMACK! The canister hits him right between the  numbers, spilling wild oats everywhere. Kurt cringes.  The sun hasn’t yet appeared. Brenda walks out to find Kurt  throwing a football against the garage roof, like when he was  a kid.  She watches him a moment. Steps up beside him.  Kurt stops. Eyes on the ground. He speaks quietly.  Brenda doesn’t answer at first. Then:  Brenda moves closer.  He shakes his head.  Kurt takes that in. Turns to her.  He lets out a breath, wrestling with that. Still unsettled.  As the sun breaks through.  Kurt mows the lawn, Zack on his shoulders. Larry steps onto  the porch with sweet tea. Watches them. Then:  LATER, they sit together out of ear shot, braving a cold fall  wind. Zack plays in the leaves nearby. Larry’s got his buck  knife out, whittling a toy tractor. Without hesitation. Kurt goes flush, but he thinks it over. Larry nods with respect.  Then Larry nods to Zack, still playing in the leaves.  Kurt meets Larry’s gaze, feeling the pressure of that. He  nods and they shake hands.  It’s winter now. THE FRONT DOOR OPENS to a humble rental  home. Kurt leads Brenda and the kids inside. ZACK is 6 now,  JESSE is 2. Toddling around.  It’s a total SLUM. Peeling paint, casement windows, and VERY  warped floorboards.  Zack inhales, taking in the smell. He puts his truck down,  feels the first wall. Kurt and Brenda watch as THE TRUCK  ROLLS DOWN THE CROOKED FLOOR TO THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  It’s snowing. Kurt rushes in from the car to the house,  carrying groceries.  He hands Brenda a bottle of pink antibiotics. Brenda and both  kids huddle under the blankets on the couch, coughing and  sneezing.  Kurt puts groceries away, stares into the half-empty fridge.  He shivers.  Kurt slams a kettle on the stove. Brenda steps in behind him,  wrapped in her robe, holding a fussing Jesse.  Brenda nods, stunned. She turns and goes back to the COUGHING  children. Kurt stands alone, barely holding it together.  Patches of ice line the shoulders. The Jimmy speeds along a  two-lane highway.  Kurt stares out the window, stuck in his own head. Suddenly,  a THUNK sounds from the engine. Kurt grips the wheel. The  power steering is gone. The car slows.  Kurt guides the Jimmy off to the shoulder. He stares at the  gauges. Swears to himself.  MOMENTS LATER Kurt and Brenda DIG in the seats for loose  change. He finds a couple quarters. Moves on to the center  compartment. Digs through wrappers and trash, excavates more  coins. Brenda feels under her seat. Fishes out a dime.  Zack nods, SHIVERING.  Kurt half-runs down the road, keeping his bare hands in his  pockets, breath visible in the freezing air.  He reaches an intersection. Looks left, right -- no gas  station. He glances back, worried. Then continues on.  A COUPLE MILES LATER. His walking slows, face buried in his  jacket. He’s exhausted, and lower than low. Finally he looks  up and sees a sign in the distance.  Kurt drops all his change on the counter. The ATTENDANT  barely looks up.  Kurt’s face drops. He turns to the guy, desperate.  The attendant looks him over, finally relents. HE NODS.  Kurt SPRINTS through the freezing snow, fingers numb from the  gas can. But he refuses to slow. ON HIS FACE, genuine fear.  He finally arrives. Rushes to the car. The windows are iced  over. Looks like a tomb in there.  He pulls open the door. Brenda has both kids in her arms,  under her coat like a blanket. They’re all SHIVERING.  Zack and Jesse are asleep in their room. Kurt shuts the door  behind him, his face a mask of worry and self-loathing.  IN THE LIVING ROOM, Kurt sits next to Brenda, who’s wrapped  in a blanket in front of a propane TANK with a heater,  GLOWING RED.  Kurt blinks back the tears.  Brenda turns to face him. Her voice level.  Kurt meets her gaze. Struck.  One by one, HAY BALES are lined up in an open pasture,  forming the outline of a football field, 1/2 the size of NFL.  Gathered in the middle are a motley crew of PLAYERS. Has-  beens and wannabes. There’s a hulking defensive lineman  called TINY. An intense, jacked-up linebacker covered in  tattoos, ALVAREZ.  Jim Foster stands before the ragtag team, flanked by a  muscled ex-NFL coach, RED BRUBAKER (50’s).  The guys LAUGH.  He walks up to the WALL of hay bales.  Jim pauses, looks BEHIND the players. Surprised to see... ON KURT, as he takes it all in, trying not to look intimidated. He nods. Then, from behind him, we REVEAL... Kurt turns to find MIKE. He smiles, gives him a BEAR HUG. LATER, IN THE PASTURE, Red runs the team through INTENSE drills. They SLAM and ATTACK with a fierceness Kurt has never seen. Alvarez SCREAMS like a crazy man, OBLITERATING anyone in his path. And loving every second of it. Kurt’s eyes go wide. He steps up. Under center. HIKE. Drops back. Gets immediately CRUSHED by Alvarez. Kurt GROANS. He smacks Kurt on the back, fired up. Red calls Kurt out. Kurt struggles to orient. Looks to his three man line.  A giant GRIN on Mike’s face.  IN THE TUNNEL, Kurt gathers with his team, ready to enter.  LOUD MUSIC and indoor FIREWORKS assault them from the arena  inside. Fans SCREAM for their favorite players, like the WWE.  Kurt takes a deep breath. Mike slaps his back.  Kurt leans close to hear over the ruckus.  It’s ABSOLUTE MADNESS:  - Players are FLIPPED into the audience. BOUNCING off the  foam pads, and right back into the action.  - Fans dressed like farm animals SCREAM at the players,  throwing beer.  - FIST FIGHTS break out in the middle of the play. Alvarez  RAGES on the field. CRUSHING any player he sees.  - Footballs BOUNCE off nets and back into the hands of the  kickoff return specialists. Kurt just stares.  FINALLY, Kurt has possession. He lines up under center. He  drops back, gets SACKED before he can even look downfield.  NEXT PLAY. Kurt tries to bail from the pocket. It collapses  before he can get away. He takes a hard HIT.  ON JIM FOSTER, PROWLING THE SIDELINE behind Red.  IN THE STANDS, Brenda watches, cringing. Kurt catches her  eye. Frustrated.  Kurt limps to a booth with Brenda and Zack. He groans  painfully as he sits.  Kurt lifts his shirt a bit, revealing a large bruise on his  ribs. Zack puts his hand on it - his way of “seeing”. Kurt  recoils from the pain. Then Zack takes Kurt’s hand and puts  it on a big nasty scrape on his elbow. Sharing injuries.  It’s not lost on Kurt that the 6-year-old complains less than  he does.  A WAITRESS sets down a giant cinnamon roll, topped with an  entire stick of melting butter. Zack licks his lips, so  stoked. Kurt sighs, venting.  He looks up at her.  Brenda stops. That didn’t sit well.  Tension. Finally Kurt nods, but his eyes are on the table.  The sun sets. It’s ICE COLD, which doesn’t faze Kurt. He’s  still out there, working with Red. The only other player is  Mike, standing in for center. Jim Foster watches.  Kurt takes a SNAP from Mike and drops back.  He drops back again. Throws again. Jim calls out.  HOURS LATER. It’s dark. Kurt is still out there, alone.  Dropping back and throwing at a painted square on a BARN.  MID-GAME. Kurt lines up under center. Looks around. Takes a  breath.  DROPS BACK. THREE STEPS. THROW. Perfect strike. 20 yard gain.  Kurt rushes up to center. Glances around. HIKE. Another  STRIKE.  And finally... TOUCHDOWN. The crowd CHEERS. Kurt beams.  Kurt packs up at his locker. Jim Foster strolls in, holding a  wad of cash. He stops in front of Kurt, thumbs through $100  bills.  He hands him a few bills.  On Kurt, and his REALIZATION. SMASH TO:  - Kurt BOMBS one to the end zone.... TOUCHDOWN.  - Dances out of the pocket. Drills another one. TOUCHDOWN. A  fan offers him a beer from the front row.  - TOUCHDOWN after TOUCHDOWN. LIGHTING.... IT.... UP. Kurt is  a TOUCHDOWN MACHINE. From this:  Brenda cradles the phone, tending to a fussing Jesse. Having  a hard time hearing.  The players’ apartment is a DUMP. Like a HOSTEL for football  players. There’s a party going on: players, cheerleaders,  locals. All CELEBRATING. And Kurt in the middle, phone pressed  to his ear. Yelling over the music.  Kurt plugs his other ear, moves off to the side.  ON BRENDA, frustrated. As Zack tries to take the phone.  More CHEERS behind him from a drinking game. Brenda’s heard  enough.  She hangs up. ON KURT, frustrated.  “GET READY FOR THIS” blares over the loudspeaker in the PITCH  BLACK venue. Then cheerleaders light SPARKLERS. PYROTECHNICS  blast. Kurt is FIRST MAN, ready to lead his team out.  And the crowd goes WILD. Foster nods to Kurt.  Kurt can’t help but SMILE. Kurt salutes, then CHARGES out  onto the field.  IN THE NOSEBLEEDS, Brenda pushes through the HECTIC CROWD,  toting Jesse and Zack. She covers Jesse’s ears.  LATER. END OF GAME, KURT BOMBS one to the end zone.  TOUCHDOWN! He’s making it look EASY. The crowd FREAKS OUT.  AFTER THE GAME, Kurt stands surrounded by fans, other  players. Brenda tries to work her way to him, kids in tow.  She gets bumped by people rushing ahead of her. Then STOPPED  by a security GUARD.  Then she looks down and realizes. Zack is gone. She instantly  PANICS. Grabs Jesse’s hand and pushes backwards through  people.  She scrambles, frantic. Calling his name, pushing people out  of the way.  Finally she spots Zack pressed up against a trash can,  rubbing his eyebrow and rocking back and forth, scared.  Brenda rushes to Zack. Throws her arms around him. Thank God.  She catches her breath, then looks through the crowd to Kurt.  Still signing autographs. Oblivious.  The kids are asleep in the car. Kurt and Brenda stand  outside, mid-argument.  From across the parking lot, Alvarez calls out.  Brenda goes cold.  But it doesn’t feel that way. She gets in the car and starts  the engine. No kiss. EMPTY. Kurt just watches her drive off.  Kurt grabs his stuff, SLAMS the locker, angry. Alvarez passes  by, stops.  He pats Kurt on the back. ON KURT, as that sinks in.  Brenda plops on the couch after tucking the kids in. Lonely.  CLICKS on the TV. Sunday Night Movie night. She looks to the  phone.  Brenda’s parents sit out on the porch of their new home,  listening to the sound of the nearby river. A long pause. Just saying it brings tears. Brenda stifles a SOB. Mom hears. Brenda wipes tears, trying to believe she deserves any of it. Brenda laughs despite herself.  Kurt lies on his bed, alone. Tosses the football in the air,  lost in thought. There’s a KNOCK at the door. Kurt opens it  to find Brenda. He’s surprised.  Kurt hesitates. Okay...  IN THE LIVING ROOM. Brenda eyes the couches, tries to find  one to sit on. They’re all GROSS.  Kurt lays a jacket down. But Brenda pulls up a chair across  from him and sits. Takes a breath, gets right to it.  Kurt tightens, already defensive. Kurt is trying to catch up. Kurt stares at her, can’t believe what he’s hearing. That word triggers something in Kurt. He gets up and walks from the room. When he returns he’s holding a jar stuffed with $100 bills. Hands it to her.  She looks at him, confused. Hurt. This has gone all wrong.  And he leaves, SLAMMING the door behind him. OFF her look--  THE CROWD RUSHES THE FIELD as the clock RUNS OUT.  Amidst the celebration and chaos, Kurt is pulled in every  direction. Reporters, fans, surrounding him. Begging for  autographs. But Kurt is utterly lost. Then his gaze settles  on a woman in the stands. It’s HIS MOM.  It’s late. They sit on the back of Sue’s flatbed truck. Kurt  drinks a beer, spins a football in his hand. Sue chuckles. They sit for a beat. Kurt feels her watching him. Kurt shrugs. She nods, already figured that out. But she doesn’t look happy about it. Kurt scoffs, a little bitter. Sue looks at him, surprised. Realizing...  Kurt takes a breath, fighting emotion.  Kurt speeds along a dark interstate.  Brenda washes dishes. Hears a KNOCK. She peeks through the  window, sees Kurt. Surprised. He speaks through the door.  AN HOUR LATER, Kurt sits leaning against the door.  ANOTHER HOUR LATER, Kurt still leans against the door.  Suddenly he hears COUNTRY MUSIC playing softly from inside.  He peers through the glass and sees Zack, RADIO IN HAND. He  sets the radio on the floor for Kurt. Then taps on the glass.  And he scurries off. Kurt smiles bittersweetly.  Brenda is up early. She peeks out the window to see:  Kurt, asleep on the porch in an old lawn chair. She SIGHS,  quietly opens the front door. Kurt springs awake.  Brenda’s voice isn’t angry. It’s compassionate.  She closes the door. He sighs.  Kurt watches TV. Sunday Night Movie. The PHONE RINGS. He  checks Caller ID. Smiles.  Kurt’s smile drops. He can tell immediately something is off.  She talks through HEAVING SOBS, barely comprehensible.  She’s WAILING now, unable to speak. Kurt leaps up.  Kurt drives as fast as he can. Worried. ON THE RADIO:  Kurt pulls up to what was once Brenda’s parents home. It’s  now just a concrete SLAB, surrounded by debris.  Brenda stands in the rubble, looking lost. Kim and her  husband JOHN stand nearby. All of them in shock.  Kurt jumps from the car and rushes to her. She COLLAPSES into  his arms.  Brenda drops to her knees on the concrete.  There’s a step in front of them that once led to the front  door. Kurt pushes away the debris. Inscribed in the concrete:  “L+J Carney”, then a heart.  Brenda bursts into SOBS. Kurt sits beside her.  Kurt tries calming her, but she HITS him, letting out her  anger. He swallows her into his arms. Just holds her.  Brenda, Kurt, Kim and John sit in a small circle of lawn  chairs in a motel parking lot, drinking beers in silence.  Brenda holds a cracked photo of the family. The only one they  found. She speaks softly, mostly to herself.  A long pause, as she tries to make sense of her own words.  Then --  Kim nods. Brenda’s eye fill with fresh tears. But they’re  different tears. She smiles, bittersweet. Then closes her  eyes.  CLOSE ON KURT, amazed by this. That she can find a way to be  grateful, even in this moment. Finally Kurt raises his beer.  They all raise a bottle. Brenda’s gaze lingers on Kurt for a  moment. Then she stands.  Kurt looks in on Zack and Jesse. Watches them sleep. He pulls  the blanket up further over Zack. Softly:  Kurt sits on the edge of the bed and lets out a breath. His  first moment alone. He rubs his temples. Then his eyes....  And suddenly TEARS. Kurt sobs as quietly as he can.  Then, from behind him, small arms wrap around his neck. It’s  Zack.  Zack doesn’t say a word. Just wipes away Kurt’s tears. And  hugs him. Kurt clutches him tight and just BREAKS.  FROM THE DOORWAY, Brenda watches them hold onto each other.  And somehow her shattered heart is mended just a bit.  Brenda and Kim each carry an urn. They walk with Kurt and  John on a path toward the river. Suddenly, Brenda stops and  pulls Kurt aside.  Kurt nods again. Okay.  Kurt takes her hand. Looks her right in the eye.  AT THE RIVER BANK, Brenda and Kim stand by the water’s edge.  Kurt and John beside them. Brenda’s urn is open.  They both SNICKER.  The boys shake there heads. Brenda addresses her urn.  Kim SNICKERS again, so does Brenda. Then the tears start.  She kneels down and spreads the ashes. They float, then  dissolve into the water. Then Kim steps forward and opens her  urn. She pours the urn, but UP and OUT instead of down.  The WIND kicks it back in her face.  Brenda busts out LAUGHING, tears still in her eyes. Kim  sneezes.  The girls cannot stop LAUGHING. Kurt tries to hold out, but  fails. Brenda looks back at him, and her smile says it all.  I’m glad you’re here.  Kurt loads the kids into a cab, then turns to face Brenda. He  wraps her in his arms. One of those long, warm moments.  Kurt waves goodbye to Kim and John, then ducks into the cab.  John and Kim pull into the driveway. Brenda climbs from the  back seat, bag in hand. She looks up to see:  Kurt standing outside the house, kids beside him. Brenda  smiles. Confused. What’s up?  Kurt opens the door. The kids lead Brenda inside, excited.  BRENDA’S POV: The ratty old house has been transformed. Rose  petals line the hall. Flickering candles lead to the backyard.  Brenda looks to Kurt. The kids GIGGLE. Zack leads his Mom  slowly forward. Jesse follows behind, picking up the flowers.  A vase of roses on the table. And a boom box. Kurt whispers  something to Zack, who grins and presses PLAY. Immediately:  ‘Fishin’ in the Dark’ plays.  Kurt takes Brenda’s hand and they start dancing. She buries  her head in his shoulder.  Kurt hits a switch that LIGHTS UP the backyard fence with  Christmas lights that spell out: “WILL YOU MARRY ME?”  Brenda GASPS. Kurt gets on one knee. Holds up a little box.  Now Kurt stalls. Turns to the kids.  They both NOD. Giggling. He turns back to Brenda.  And she KISSES him.  Kurt, mid-game. Playing hard. Having a blast. The crowd is  LOVING HIM. Chanting his name. Brenda SCREAMS for him in the  front row, kids by her side.  Kurt throws a scoring pass. As he runs back mid-field, a  BUSINESSMAN calls to him from behind the wall.  Kurt nods at the guy. Sure, pal. No idea who he is. But JIM  FOSTER sees him and cringes. He knows EXACTLY who the guy is.  LAST DRIVE. Kurt has a heck of a game, but they miss the win  by ONE FOOT. In Kurt’s disappointment...  POST GAME, Kurt greets fans, Brenda by his side. The  Businessman approaches.  Gillis waits for it to register. Kurt looks to Jim Foster,  confused. Jim just shrugs.  On Kurt and his SHOCK.  MIKE MARTZ, the Rams’ offensive coordinator, sits with DICK  VERMEIL, the head coach, and JOHN RAMSDELL, the quarterbacks  coach. Vermeil studies the depth chart.  KURT AND BRENDA’S WEDDING RECEPTION - A humble, old fashioned  potluck. Filled with family and friends. Including KURT’S  DAD. Kurt and Brenda dance. He’s in a tux and she looks  STUNNING in her wedding dress.  LATER, Brenda leads Jesse (now 4) to the middle of the dance  floor. Hands her the mic. She turns to Kurt.  The crowd responds with a collective “AWWWWW” as the band  plays “Butterfly Kisses”. Kurt LIFTS Jesse up and floats with  her across the floor, eyes filled with tears.  LATER, The DJ plays the song: “Thanks to the Keeper of the  Stars.” Zack holds the mic and BELTS OUT every word. Kurt  stands next to his dad, listening. Both share a beer.  END OF THE NIGHT. Kurt and Brenda dance, surrounded by their  friends. Admiring each other and the kids.  His eyes light up. Hell yeah!  NFL Training Camp - the sequel. Kurt drives up and jumps from  his truck. Like a racehorse breaking from the gate.  ON THE PRACTICE FIELD  Quarterback TRENT GREEN is the clear number one. Kurt watches  from the sideline as Trent takes all the reps. And makes the  HARDEST THROWS. Kurt’s not the only one with a strong arm.  Mike Martz claps from the sideline.  Martz steps close to Kurt. Doesn’t make eye contact, just  starts talking.  Martz nods. Exactly. He steps close. Looks to Kurt’s  playbook.  With that, he walks away. Another player, ISSAC BRUCE, steps  up.  Kurt LAUGHS, grateful.  Isaac smiles and trots off.  Mike Martz has turned Kurt into his personal whipping boy.  Berating him at every turn.  ON THE FIELD - INTERCUTTING  Trent makes a throw.  Kurt makes the exact same throw.  Kurt shakes his head. Isaac steps close.  Isaac points up, then pumps his fist over his heart. A symbol  of faith. Kurt registers.  The quarterbacks and receivers watch film. IN THE FOOTAGE,  Trent throws a pass slightly BEHIND Isaac, the receiver.  Martz freezes the frame.  MORE VIDEO. This time Kurt makes a near identical throw,  slightly behind his receiver. Martz explodes.  A couple guys CHUCKLE at this. Damn.  Martz takes out a $50 bill and sticks it to a chair with a  piece of chewed gum. As he walks out --  ON THE FIELD. Kurt lines up behind JONES, his center. Jones  flubs the snap. The ball SQUIBS away. Martz blows his  WHISTLE, storms onto the field. Gets inches from Kurt’s face.  The other players look around. WTF? They know Kurt never even  touched the ball. Not his fault. Martz points over at Jones.  More looks. Is Kurt just going to take it?  HOLD ONTO THE BALL.  Kurt takes a breath, but keeps his mouth shut.  FROM A DISTANCE, Coach Vermeil watches. Isaac trots up beside  him.  Vermeil nods. Taking it all in from a distance.  Kurt, in civilian clothes, walks out onto the turf of the  gleaming new stadium. Looks up and around.  Kurt turns to face Coach Dick Vermeil.  He holds out his hand. Smiles.  Kurt shakes his hand, ecstatic. Then gives him a HUGE HUG.  Kurt walks Brenda through a spacious, brand new house. It’s  beautiful. She can’t believe it.  He hugs her. She takes in the huge empty foyer.  Her eyes go WIDE.  And she practically tackles him.  Game on. The Rams have the ball. TITLE:  Trent Green drops back to pass, delivers STRIKE AFTER STRIKE  to the Rams’ fleet of talented receivers.  Kurt, #13 in his Rams uniform and wearing a headset, CHEERS  from the sidelines next to Coach Ramsdell, watches Trent  complete yet another perfectly threaded pass.  UP IN THE STANDS, Brenda sits with three other Rams WIVES,  all clearly younger and better dressed. They wear gobs of  jewelry, full makeup and tailored jerseys with their  husbands’ names on the back. Brenda is a fish out of water.  OUT ON THE FIELD, Trent stands in the pocket, releases the  ball just as the Chargers’ safety CRASHES INTO HIM.  Trent falls to the turf, clutching his knee. All the players  react. Issac throws his fist into the turf.  ON THE COACHES. Dick Vermeil blinks. Martz’s face goes white.  The TRAINERS rush out. Trent is writhing in pain.  Kurt steps forward. Looking at the situation... then he  glances up to the Jumbotron and realizes how bad this is. THE  CAMERAS ARE ALL ON HIM. From this:  MONTAGE OF NEWS FOOTAGE. THE KURT WARNER DEBATE HAS BEGUN:  - Sportscenter. Every network and halftime report. Sports  radio. The entire SPORTS NATION is talking about Kurt Warner.  Not much furniture yet. The TV blares SPORTSCENTER. Knees  bouncing, Kurt watches intently, just like the draft years  earlier. But this time the TV has his picture on it.  Kurt watches and listens, taking it all in.  ESPN TALKING HEAD (ON SCREEN)  They LAUGH. Kurt’s jaw tightens, then his gaze shifts out the  window, to a new JOHN DEERE MOWER in the yard. He looks to  Zack, playing with a BLACK TRUCK.  Then he looks back to the TV and... it takes everything in  him... Turns it OFF. Takes in the silence.  Zack nods. Kurt takes one last look at the TV, then...  The mower travels in a big circle in the yard. Zack WHOOPS  and YELLS, sitting on Kurt’s lap... DRIVING!  Kurt LAUGHS. Good point. He sees the excitement and sheer  confidence on Zack’s face.  Brenda drives up to the house. Listening to the RADIO.  HUFFING. Getting more angry with EVERY SENTENCE.  Then she looks up and double takes. She sees -- ZACK DRIVING  THE RIDER MOWER BY HIMSELF! She jumps from the car...  Brenda spins to find Kurt on a lounge chair, drink in hand.  Reluctant, she sits next to Kurt. Then watches for a minute  as Zack drives in circles. She smiles.  Kurt stands in Martz’s office. Waiting. He glances at all the  pictures, memorabilia and swag on the walls.  Finally Martz storms in. Looks Warner up and down.  Martz checks him. Interesting. Kurt meets his gaze. Doesn’t blink. With that, he walks right out the door. Martz sits for a long beat. Then he nods. Smirks. Picks up the PHONE. And dials.  IN HIS OFFICE, on the other end, Vermeil lowers the phone...  a SMILE crosses his face.  Dick Vermeil faces a room full of reporters. There’s a BUZZ  in the space. Questions flying at him. “What’s the next  move?” “Can you tell us your plan?”.....  Vermeil waits for it to quiet down. He leans into the mic.  FLASHBULBS POP. The place ERUPTS with questions.  The parking lot is filled with Rams fans pre-gaming.  AN ARIAL SHOT OF THE PACKED STADIUM. It plays on a TV SCREEN  Where Hudnutt and the other arena players watch at the bar.  Warner’s picture flashes on screen and they all YELL.  Brenda rushes in high heels down the cavernous halls to the  restricted area. Flashes her pass to a guard.  The Rams players file out. Kurt hangs back. He lays out his  jersey, with the name WARNER on the back. #13. Smooths his  hand over it, just like when he was a kid.  Kurt turns back. His face lights up.  She pulls a piece of paper from her purse. Flattens it.  Kurt wipes his eyes, overwhelmed.  Kurt beams. He carefully takes the paper and tucks it inside  his pocket.  She takes his face in her hands.  A long and beautiful kiss.  Kurt stands tall amidst his band of brothers. They run out  one-by-one as the ANNOUNCER calls their name. Kurt takes a deep breath. He catches Isaac Bruce’s eye. Who pumps his chest and points at Kurt. Finally:  PA ANNOUNCER (O.S.)  Number 13 -- KUUURT WARNER!! As Kurt runs out onto the turf, he points two fingers to the sky. Takes in the CHEERS, the spectacle, the sold out crowd. This is it. He made it. IN THE STANDS, Brenda joins Kurt’s Mom and Matt. And on Matt’s other side - Kurt’s father. They’re on their feet, SCREAMING and CHEERING. Sue gives Brenda a hug and Brenda points down at Kurt: ON THE FIELD, Kurt runs to the Rams sideline, helmet in hand. MOMENTS LATER, the National Anthem is sung. Kurt stands. Hand over his heart. And everyone CHEERS. Kurt finds BRENDA in the stands. Blows her a kiss. Vermeil walks right up to Kurt. Kurt nods. Pumped. Then he looks across the field to the Raven’s linebacker. RAY LEWIS, #52. He’s an absolute BEAST. Staring daggers at Kurt. Kurt swallows. OFF THIS: THE RAVENS KICK OFF. The football spins end over end as: Kurt lines up behind center, barks out the count, then hands off to Marshall Faulk, who gains two yards off the tackle. ON THE RAVENS DEFENSE, RAY LEWIS shouts out instructions to his teammates. Kurt drops back for his first pass. Lewis blitzes from the left side, around a lineman and SLAMS KURT TO THE GROUND.  TV ANNOUNCER (O.C.) As Lewis climbs off Kurt: Kurt pops up, shaking it off. Runs back into the huddle. Kurt nods. Pumped. Gets into position. NEXT PLAY. Kurt drops back, has protection, fires a BULLET to Isaac for a gain of 22 yards. Another STRIKE, again to Isaac, IN THE STANDS, Brenda CHEERS. Kurt’s MOM and DAD exchange a look - so damn proud. ON THE FIELD, Kurt threads the needle to AZ AKIM, for a first down. Kurt pump fakes, throws a slant to Faulk that is -- INTERCEPTED BY RAY LEWIS Kurt sprints back, attempting a tackle. He misses, but one hand grabs Lewis’ jersey, slowing him down enough for more Rams to stop him. Lewis PREENS for the audience. Beats his chest. Mocks Kurt. Kurt walks off the field. Deflated. He paces. Losing confidence. Suddenly AN ASSIST runs over to him, holding out a phone. Kurt takes it, looking up to the PRESS BOX. TO MARTZ. Where he calls plays from the Eagle’s Nest. Kurt jumps back to his feet. Let’s go! Kurt walks to center. Surveys. Takes a breath... IN THE STANDS. HIKE! Kurt marches his team downfield. FAST. At the SPEED of Arena Football. Kurt runs the play action to Faulk, then sends a beautiful HIGH ARCING PASS to the tight end ROLAND WILLIAMS, who CATCHES IT at the back of the end zone!!  TV ANNOUNCER (O.C.) IN THE STANDS, Brenda throws her arms around Sue, FREAKING OUT! Sue beams. AT THE BAR, the place ERUPTS! Hudnutt raises his beer. AT HOME Zack listens, glued to a radio. Jumping up and down. KURT to Marshall Faulk for 40 yards. KURT with a nifty shovel pass to Az Akim for 17 yards. CLOSE ON KURT - he seems to move in Slo Motion as he scans the field, past the defense, then fires a bullet to -- ISAAC BRUCE, WHO CATCHES IT for their 2nd touchdown. Kurt nods to himself, his face focused and alive. He looks to the stands again, for Brenda. WE SEE HER JUMPING AND SCREAMING, hugging everyone, unaware Kurt is watching. He grins to himself, then turns back to the game. ANOTHER PASS, a gorgeous fade to Tony Holt for a 20 YARD TD. FINAL PLAY. Rams have possession. IN THE STANDS, Brenda looks at the scoreboard, then to Kurt on the field. Puts her hands to her face in disbelief. He’s about to win it! ON THE FIELD, Kurt walks up to center. Isaac and the other players pat him on the head. Kurt smiles, catches the hike, then takes a KNEE to run out the clock. As the CROWD CHEERS, we cut to - CLOSE ON KURT’S FACE, through his helmet, down on one knee, he closes his eyes.... AND EVERYTHING STOPS, ALL SOUND FADES AWAY. And in this incredible, life changing moment, he silently prays... Then Kurt opens his eyes and EVERYTHING RUSHES BACK. Crazed fans rush the field. Teammates hug and celebrate. Players run to Kurt to congratulate him. But he has only one thing on his mind... WITH THE GAME BALL IN HIS HANDS, he pushes past his teammates, through the CHAOS, through raving PRESS wanting to get a comment -- pausing only as Coach Vermeil pats him on the back and smiles -- -- and Kurt continues through, fighting against the tide, searching. IN THE STANDS, Brenda runs down toward him, calling his name, racing for the field, where... KURT FINALLY SPOTS HER -- -- and JUMPS up to the railing. Brenda leans over and Kurt hands her the winning game ball. She’s absolutely BEAMING. He draws her in close, face to face. It’s just the two of them now. He speaks over the crowd, tears in his eyes. Brenda smiles through her own tears. It’s a moment of sheer victory. A lifetime of struggles, of pain, of dreaming -- as he pulls her in for a KISS. And from this, we..... But it’s not over yet. OVER BLACK, sound RUSHES back in. CHEERING CROWDS. COMMENTATORS, one after the other, each more energetic than the last, blending into a chorus covering a season of victories - “THE GREATEST SHOW ON TURF.”  The CHEERS build and build and BUILD....  Kurt sits on the bench. Just like we met him. ANGLE ON the  name on his jersey: WARNER. #13.  WIDEN TO REVEAL.... IT’S THE SUPER BOWL!  Kurt stands. Surveys. Takes a breath. Clutches his rib cage  in pain. Walks toward the field. Steps up to Coach.  He looks to the SCOREBOARD that shows the game tied up, 16 to  16. Two minutes remain. A situation worthy of Dan Marino.  Kurt walks onto the field. A man born for HIS MOMENT. Trades  a glance with Isaac Bruce.  FINAL HUDDLE. Kurt takes the snap. Protecting his ribs as he  steps back, looking for his window.  KURT POV - things slow down as the Titans’ defense CHARGE  DIRECTLY FOR HIM, ready to crush him.  CLOSE ON KURT - as he breathes, staying focused, waiting for  his moment. FEET PLANTED.  IN THE STANDS, Brenda watches, just as focused. She whispers. And he doesn’t budge. Rears back to THROW. Here comes the rush. Knows he’s gonna take a HIT, and LETS... IT... FLY. AND IN THIS MOMENT, we quickly FLASH BACK TO KURT AS A KID, throwing the ball against his house... JUST AS #90 Jevon Kearse crashes into him. AND KURT HITS THE GROUND HARD. He quickly sits up and looks. The ball SPINNING IN THE AIR. OFF THIS -- WE CUT TO ACTUAL GAME FOOTAGE. And watch as the real Isaac Bruce catches it and runs it into the endzone. “THE RAMS WIN THE SUPERBOWL!” WE STAY WITH THE REAL FOOTAGE NOW. The real Kurt Warner, as he runs to the real Brenda in the stands. She leans down and he kisses her. AFTER THE GAME. Kurt talking to reporters. Thanking God. Thanking his teammates. Thanking Brenda. His family. Raising the silver Lombardi HIGH INTO THE AIR. An underdog. A champion. Kurt Warner’s touchdown throw in the 1999 Super Bowl broke Joe Montana’s all time post-season pass record. He was named the MVP of the game. The Rams’ 1999 season, known as “The Greatest Show on Turf”, is still considered one of greatest underdog stories in the history of sports. Kurt was inducted into the NFL hall of fame in 2017. He is widely considered to be the best undrafted NFL player of all Kurt and Brenda are happily married to this day. They have seven children. THEN... one final shot. Home footage of a high school graduation. It’s Zack, receiving his diploma. Zack graduated High School in 2012. Proving everyone wrong. Again. AND WE END ON the real Kurt and Brenda cheering in the crowd.
