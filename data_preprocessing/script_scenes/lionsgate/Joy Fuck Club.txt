A car drives down a pretty suburban road. CHYRON: 1998. * JOE SULLIVAN drives with his wife MARY in the passenger seat. They’re white, pleasant-looking, in their 40s. Mary turns around and we see her from a BACKSEAT POV. We hear their daughter, AUDREY (age 4).  MARY/JOE/AUDREY  A PLAYGROUND WE WILL GO / A  PLAYGROUND WE WILL GO / WE’LL PET A  DOG AND SIT ON A LOG AND THEN WE’LL  GO BACK HOME OFF the car driving as the little family sings merrily... Several kids play in the sandbox and on the jungle gym as their parents look on. Everyone is Midwestern, wholesome, corn- fed, and white, except for... JENNY and WEY CHEN (early 30s) approach with their daughter LOLO (age 4). Jenny looks nervously to her husband. Lolo tugs at her Mom’s pant leg. Lolo runs to the sandbox and starts digging with her toy pail and shovel. A little BOY comes up to her.  Ching chong ching chong choo! Lolo SLUGS him. The Boy yelps, rushing off to find his mother. The Chens look down at Lolo. Jenny and Wey can’t help but smile at their feisty daughter, then look up as Joe and Mary Sullivan approach. The Sullivans coax their daughter out from hiding behind them. It turns out Audrey, whose voice we heard earlier, is also Asian! Audrey’s eyes go wide at the sight of Lolo. Audrey nods, yes. As the girls play... BEGIN STYLIZED MUSIC MONTAGE OF THE GIRLS GROWING UP: - The Chens and Sullivans send Audrey and Lolo to preschool, where they stand out amid their white classmates. Audrey looks a little scared until rambunctious Lolo grabs her hand and they head in, smiling. - Audrey and Lolo, now in grade school, stand among a group of * GIRL SCOUTS. Audrey’s uniform is perfect and her sash displays * DOZENS of badges; her TROOP LEADER hands her another one and * Audrey’s face lights up. Meanwhile, Lolo has no badges, eats * straight out of a box of Thin Mints, and wipes her chocolatey * fingertips on her uniform between bites. * - A ROAST HAM HITS THE TABLE. WIDER to see the Sullivans hosting the Chens for Christmas. Perfect table settings, super civilized. Audrey wears a cute J Crew dress; Lolo wears an oversize Champion t-shirt. The Sullivans say grace. - A ROAST DUCK HITS THE TABLE. WIDER to see the Chens hosting the Sullivans for Chinese New Year. The extended Chen clan is there (including Lolo’s weird, unblinking cousin DEADEYE, 10), diving into the food in a mad scramble. Lolo and her mother are in matching qipaos. Audrey looks wistfully at how much they look alike. Then she shakes it off and wraps an arm around her mom, Mary. Mary beams. - High school. On a sign: “AUDREY FOR PRESIDENT!”. Audrey, 17, hands out stickers to classmates in the hall. Nearby, Lolo, 17, stands under a sign: “SENIOR ART SHOW”. She proudly displays a weird photograph of a cat that’s been altered with * splotches of paint, feathers, yarn, etc. People walking by * avert their eyes, disturbed. * - FLASH! Audrey, 21, in college has her picture taken as she receives a Top Scholar Award. More FLASHES as she receives various accolades: Student Bar Association! Captain of the * Crew Team! President of Chinese Students Association (with her * co-president, KAREN. We’ll see more of her later). - FLASH! Lolo, 21, nude and smeared with colorful paint, poses for an aggressively artsy photo. WIDEN TO REVEAL it was taken by a camera on a timer against a hastily-hung background. After a moment, Lolo’s mom Jenny enters with a laundry basket and tears down the background, revealing the washing machine behind it. She and Lolo get into an argument. * END SEQUENCE. Big giant law firm, dead of night. Silent and dark, except for a crack of light under one closed office door. We hear a faint PHONE ALARM... Multiple framed degrees and certificates hang on the walls of this immaculately-kept office, and a long line of AWARDS are neatly displayed on a shelf. On the desk, a name plate that reads “AUDREY HAN SULLIVAN” and photos of Audrey and her * parents. * UNDER THE DESK - curled up on the floor: AUDREY, now 27, is asleep in her work clothes. That is, until she finally hears her phone alarm. She grabs the phone and silences it. She * emerges from under the desk, shakes off the grogginess, and sits back in her chair, all business. Back to work! QUICK CUTS of Audrey working: 4AM: Audrey’s on a video call with a client in Berlin.  AUDREY (INTO PHONE)  --Guten Tag, Fraulein Lingenfelter? 7AM: A chipper Audrey greets a groggy associate, BECKETT, who has just come in. She hands bleary Beckett the file as she exits. 10AM: In a conference room, Audrey and a senior partner, FRANK (white, 50s, Midwestern), meet with CLIENTS: * Audrey looks panicked for a split second-- she’s not an * expert, actually-- but then recovers and smiles, too used to * microaggressions like this to be offended. She nods, happy for * Frank’s approval. * Glasses CLINK as Frank pours champagne for Audrey and a few ASSOCIATES. Everyone cheers. Frank comes over to Audrey. Audrey is stunned, delighted. Audrey beams. * Audrey and Frank turn to see LOLO, 27, entering, in an outfit somehow tight and raggedy at the same time, and slept-in eye makeup. Audrey is surprised, a little embarrassed. Audrey looks apologetically at Frank; good thing he’s merely amused (and probably staring at Lolo’s booty shorts). In contrast to Audrey’s ultra-together vibe, Lolo is a hot mess and doesn’t give a shit. Her car is filled with photography equipment, paint cans, spools of yarn, wood * blocks, empty Cheetos bags and water bottles. She bounces * along to a track by Dumbfoundead as she drives. Audrey doesn’t answer, immersed in a work file. Lolo grabs it and chucks it in the back. Audrey reaches back to get her work file, then sees amongst * the clutter in the backseat a large framed photo of a * cornfield splotched with paint, yarn strewn over it, etc. It’s * got a messy, cool vibe to it. * Lolo notices that Audrey is looking back at her work file. * Lolo starts ear flicking Audrey. Audrey tries to fend her off, laughing. Audrey and Lolo sit with their parents, it’s an informal dinner. Audrey’s mother dramatically unveils a beautiful, homemade cake with “BON VOYAGE” written on top. Mary brings out a box. * But Mary is already passing out photos of baby Audrey in China being carried by a young Joe and Mary. Audrey rifles absently through the box, which also holds old * keepsakes: folders, random paperwork, mostly in Chinese. Then she sees the edge of something sticking out of the box lining. It must have gotten stuck there. She pulls it out...it’s a faded photo of a YOUNG ASIAN WOMAN in a hospital gown, holding a newborn Audrey. The woman’s hair hides half her face; the other half is obscured by shadows. Audrey feels her breath catch... she turns the picture over to see her birthdate and the words “Birth Mother.” Mary notices. Audrey is overwhelmed from seeing the picture; she quickly * puts it aside. * Joe puts an arm around her; she dabs at her eyes; Audrey * smiles at them both. This trio fucking loves each other. Lolo * takes a picture of the birth mom photo. * Audrey is uncomfortable with the topic of her birth mother. She puts the picture away: It’s clear Audrey wants to move on, but Lolo studies the picture of Audrey’s birth mom. * Audrey sits in a bustling terminal. She messages her parents: “Layover in LA! Boarding soon! (string of heart emojis)”. She * gets back to working on her laptop when Lolo collapses in the seat next to her. Lolo looks over Audrey’s shoulder Lolo shows her phone to Audrey - it’s the photo of Audrey’s * birth mom, but painted over in an artsy way. * Audrey recoils to see DEADEYE, 28, who’s appeared next to her. Wearing an “It’s an Honor Just to be Asian” shirt, a fanny pack and lots of eye-liner, she’s specific AF. With her flat voice and blank stare, Deadeye is an apt name. blink or smile, stares at Audrey, who looks uncomfortable. She matter-of-factly takes out some Fun Dip and snorts it. * Audrey pulls Lolo aside: ANGLE ON Deadeye, talking to a random child. The child’s parent grabs the kid away from Deadeye. Audrey sighs, doesn’t love it, but concedes. They head back to Deadeye pulls something out of her fanny pack. Lolo and Deadeye cheerfully break their glow sticks which light up. Audrey has no idea how to react. Lolo checks Deadeye’s boarding pass. Their plane takes off. Audrey, Lolo and Deadeye push their luggage trolleys through the airport, heading for the exit. Deadeye charges ahead, she’s been here before. Audrey looks around in amazement, taking it all in. * Lolo points to a man dressed in a business suit talking into a * Bluetooth headset. Audrey points to a group of HOT YOUNG WOMEN in tight outfits. * As the group swans right through security, surrounded by fans * The girls are in a cab as beautiful city sights whiz by; Lolo * is taking photos with her professional camera out the window. * ANGLE ON Audrey staring at work emails on her phone, missing * all of this. Lolo notices, then flicks Audrey in the ear. * They exit the taxi and step onto a high-end street lined with sleek townhomes. *  Hold up, Karen has a pussy tatt? Audrey presses the BUZZER. As they wait:  KAREN GOT A PUSSY TAT, PUSSY TAT  KAREN, WHATCHU GOT DOWN UNDER, A The door OPENS. Audrey, Lolo and Deadeye enter the luxuriously-appointed home as KAREN, 27, greets them. Karen and Audrey squeal and hug. Karen is serene, elegant, and * sports a giant diamond engagement ring-- she looks nothing at * all like a woman with a pussy tattoo. * Lolo looks around and rolls her eyes-- Karen’s wall decor * consists of framed articles and magazine photos of herself. * Karen, meanwhile, takes in Lolo’s absolutely ratchet outfit * and makeup vibe. Doesn’t love it. Karen glances at Audrey who tries to cheerfully move past it: Karen squeals as she links arms with Audrey. Lolo looks annoyed to be edged out. She looks at Lolo’s outfit disdainfully. * A massive, luxe club spanning several floors. Lolo’s jaw * drops: nothing about this place is lame. It’s fucking awesome. * She and Audrey are wide-eyed as Karen leads them through the * club, which has oversized chandeliers and MODEL WAITSTAFF * ferrying silver buckets of champagne to Beijing’s colorful “it” crowd. They head towards a VIP booth, where their table * is laden with cocktails, dumplings, and treats. * Karen takes a group selfie, checks it. Sees Deadeye’s face. * Karen waves at CLARENCE, 30, who is wending his way towards * them. The crowd looks like it’s almost magically...parting for * him? Because HOLY SHIT: this dude is the hottest piece of ass * in the Middle Kingdom (think Harry Shum, Jr.). He’s so good- * looking, it’s distracting. * Clarence arrives at their booth and Karen slips her hand into * his. He raises it to his lips and kisses it, looking lovingly * at Karen the whole time. Lolo can’t believe this shit. *  she is on the outside. Audrey reacts surprised, pure? Clarence and Karen nuzzle. Lolo, still thirsting after Clarence, pours herself an entire * glass of vodka, then sees Karen looking at her, judgy. * Karen glares at Lolo, but it all goes over Clarence’s head.  old friends get together, they He gets up and takes off his sweater, his T-shirt riding up to show a perfect six-pack. Lolo’s mouth falls open. Clarence pecks Karen on the cheek and exits. Lolo turns to Karen: Audrey chokes on her drink. Deadeye calmly eats a dumpling. * Audrey jumps in. * Hugs. Squeals. Lolo stares at them, sullen. * Audrey’s delighted. Karen’s delighted. Lolo’s shocked and * rapidly getting to enraged-- this is a NIGHTMARE scenario for * her-- which makes Karen even more delighted. * Karen is really sticking it to Lolo now. She turns to Audrey. * Karen grabs Audrey’s hand and leads her to the dance floor, * leaving Lolo and Deadeye at the booth. * Deadeye stands up in her seat and begins a weird dance with * her arms in front of her like a cat. OFF Lolo, angrily looking * at Karen and Audrey having a great time on the dance floor. * We see a MINI-MONTAGE of the girls enjoying Beijing: TEMPLE: Audrey and Karen, arm-in-arm, walk the peaceful * grounds as Lolo takes photos of the temple and garden. * Deadeye, lagging behind everyone, has earbuds in and is * listening to BTS. * MUSEUM: Audrey and Karen walk up to the ticket booth as Lolo * scrounges in her bag for cash. Deadeye, earbuds in, listening * to Girls’ Generation, ends up buying her ticket for her. * HIGH-END BOUTIQUE: Audrey and Karen happily shop for bags. Lolo checks a price tag and recoils. She sullenly goes to sit * down next to Deadeye, who is listening to After School. * KAREN’S HOUSE: Lolo lies around, bored, as Audrey works on her * laptop. Karen enters and surprises Audrey with a gift-- she’s * bought her one of the bags! Deadeye has earbuds in and is listening to Blackpink. Off Lolo, feeling left out... Lolo leads the group as they walk through a painfully generic * industrial park. Audrey and Karen look around, unsure what they’re doing there. Audrey looks at Deadeye, who’s still got her earbuds in. On Audrey, okay then. She calls to Lolo. * Lolo turns the corner, gestures to a sign on one of the offices: “Gladwell Adoption Services.” Deadeye, seeing the sign, finally takes out her earbuds. Lolo holds up her phone, showing the picture of Audrey’s birth mom. Audrey finally sighs, relenting to Lolo’s enthusiasm. * As they head in... Lolo sighs, shakes her head; Karen is so lame. Audrey and the gang sit across from a PERKY ADOPTION AGENT (40s, American, think Michelle Buteau). There are multiple * portraits on display of happy American couples with their * Chinese babies. * Lolo hands Audrey’s passport to the Agent, who takes it, types it into her computer. Audrey looks a bit uneasy. As the Perky Agent types: * At this, Audrey looks surprised but also a bit intrigued -- * this is the first moment that sparks a genuine interest in her * birth mother. * The Perky Agent looks to Audrey. Everyone else looks to her * too, waiting as Audrey considers. Finally: * The Perky Agent exits. *  FUCK YEAH BABY, WE’RE ABOUT TO FIND *  MOMMALA! THIS IS EPICCCC-- *  SMASH TO: * A couple hours later. The girls are getting antsy. *  Why’s this taking so long? The Perky Agent enters with a folder, followed by a stern- * looking, humorless U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIAL (think Jon Hamm). *  This is Agent Lindstrom, from the *  U.S. Embassy. * Lolo takes out her burner phone, starts filming the scene. * Lolo gives Deadeye her phone to continue filming, then she * starts pacing around, opening drawers, cabinets, etc. * Audrey’s trying to remain calm. * Lolo darts forward and grabs the Embassy Official’s badge and * shows it to Deadeye, who is still filming. * The Embassy Official snatches his badge back. * The Perky Agent hands Audrey the file. The girls look * dumbfounded as they walk out: wtf just happened? * As soon as they’re out of sight of the agency doors, Audrey * smacks Lolo. * Lolo takes the file out of her hands and flips through it. * Deadeye looks at the file and dials the number... * She dials as Deadeye studies the file. * the street; they’re pretending to take a photo, but it’s * clearly to get Karen in the background. * Karen puts an arm around Audrey and they begin to walk away as * Lolo looks on, scowling. As they pass the giggling fans who * were taking a stealth pic of Karen: * The fans eyes’ widen, horrified that someone insulted their * idol, and raise their phones to film Lolo, who flips them off * as she walks away. * Audrey, Lolo, and Deadeye are putting overnight bags into a * black Escalade with the help of the driver, ARTHUR (think * Jimmy O. Yang). Clarence and Karen emerge; Clarence is holding * a GIANT fucking Louis Vuitton suitcase. *  fine if Chunhwa looks raggedy. * Clarence faces Karen to say goodbye. * He holds up his phone-- he and Karen have each other’s * She glances over at Lolo; she’s playing it just the slightest * bit sultry, on purpose. Lolo rolls her eyes, Karen leans in to * give Clarence a kiss...and he beats her to it, pecking her * ever so lightly on the lips. * He exits. A beat, the Lolo laughs. * Karen ignores her as she gets in the car. Lolo shrugs and * shows the pic to Deadeye instead. * Arthur greets the girls. * Lolo whispers to the other girls. *  Arthur has crazy eyes. * Audrey pulls out her laptop. * Lolo’s eyes narrow. Deadeye puts in her headphones. * Deadeye closes her eyes. The music is pounding out of her * headphones. * Everyone shrugs. Arthur turns back to Karen. * Lolo looks like she’s about to murder/suicide someone. * The car drives along. Karen is now sitting in the passenger * seat, next to Arthur. * As Karen continues chatting pleasantly with Arthur, Lolo * watches them, whispering to Audrey and Karen. * In the front of the car, Arthur is still excitedly fanboying * to Karen about the show. * Arthur lifts up a sleeve to reveal that he has a tattoo of her * character Chunhwa’s face on his wrist. * In the backseat, the others register this: WTF? Karen pats * Arthur on the hand. * Arthur beams, stares in awe at the hand Karen touched. * Lolo and Deadeye clock this and exchange a glance. Weird. * An empty stretch of road. As Arthur drives, PAN over everyone * sleeping. In the back seat, Deadeye is snoring loudly even as * music blasts from her headphones. Audrey is finally taking a * break from her laptop and work files. Lolo is drooling, her * phone propped up, mid-text. In the passenger seat, Karen is * also asleep, but as the camera gets closer, she senses * something in front of her face. * She opens her eyes to see Arthur STARING OVER HER. * Arthur swerves. * By now the other girls are wide awake. * Arthur starts ranting, driving errantically. * As Arthur continues babbling nonsense and driving dangerously, * Karen lunges for the wheel. A scuffle ensues as everyone * shouts. * Finally Deadeye THWACKS Arthur on the head with Karen’s * handbag, one SWIFT, HARD HIT. He’s instantly out, falling * forward, unconscious, onto the wheel as the car spins out of * control. As everyone screams, Karen finally is able to * scramble partway over to grab the wheel and stick a foot on * the brake, but she can only slow the car down a little before * it crashes into the guardrail. * The girls exit the smoking car. Arthur is unconscious and * bleeding, slumped over the wheel. * Karen holds up her phone. * Lolo holds up her janky phone. * Deadeye points to Arthur who stirs and opens his eyes. * The girls react, panicky, but then he drops his head and * passes out again. * Arthur stirs again, this time with a groan. The girls look to * each other and start rapidly walking away. * Hours later. The girls, hot and cranky, looking bedraggled, * haul their stuff down the road. Audrey looks around at the * desolate scene as she listlessly holds up a hitchhiking hand. *  haven’t seen one car? * Lolo glares accusingly at Karen, who looks too weak to fight. * Audrey turns to Lolo. *  battery’s at like, 7%. * Karen dabs her face. *  Like what, a melted-contour paste * Lolo picks up her camera and snaps a picture of Karen. * Just then, they hear a vehicle coming towards them. They turn * and see headlights. A glimmer of hope! * The girls wave at the bus, trying to flag it down. * As the bus gets closer, they can start to make out the logo on * the side... * The bus stops. The doors open. STEPHON MARBURY appears, bathed * in light, gorgeous and god-like. * The other girls look shocked -- it really is him. * REVEAL: a bus full of SMOKING HOT, SWEATY, SHIRTLESS * BASKETBALL PLAYERS. Lolo smiles wide. Audrey’s jaw drops. * Deadeye’s jaw drops. Even Karen can’t hide a hint of delight-- * this bus is heaven. * Lolo settles into a seat next to Stephon and plugs her phone * into an outlet. The bus is tricked out with leather seats, TV * screens, and even a skylight. * Stephon Marbury looks intensely at Lolo. * They start making out, hard. Audrey takes out her laptop to * set up her zoom call, then turns to Karen. * Karen on the shoulder. * Todd nods at Karen, who is trying to look away. * Karen hurriedly moves away. ANGLE BACK ON Lolo and Marbury. * Stephon Marbury reaches over as if to point to her heart, but * then cups her full breast. She smiles, into it. * Lolo and Marbury take off towards the back of the bus. ANGLE * ON Audrey, headphones on, talking to Frank on her computer * screen. INTERCUT WITH: Frank at the office. * ANGLE ON Karen, sitting in the back of the bus, finishing her * phone call. Deadeye comes by with a water, which Karen * gratefully takes. * Deadeye looks over at Todd. * But Karen can’t help looking around-- it’s like every single * bball player on the bus is moving in SLOW-MO, flexing biceps, * stretching, showing off their sinewy muscles... Karen makes a * squeaky, pained noise. * ANGLE BACK ON Audrey on her zoom. * Behind Audrey, two of the shirtless basketball players are * horsing around, throwing a mini basketball. * Suddenly, we hear a loud noise coming from outside the bus. * Yes they are-- SIRENS BLARE as a police car appears behind the * bus, pulling it over. * Just then, one of the shirtless basketball players behind * Audrey pantses the other, revealing his BUTT right in the Zoom * frame. * She shuts the zoom window. The police sirens continue as the * bus driver pulls over, opens his door, and begins talking in * Mandarin to a couple of POLICE OFFICERS who have approached * the door and are standing outside. Audrey turns to Karen and * Deadeye. * Karen and Deadeye share a look of concern as they listen in on * the conversation in Mandarin. * Karen doesn’t want to say it’s Audrey’s fault. * ANGLE ON one of the police officers ascending the bus steps. * He’s a huge, scary-looking man with Khal Drogo vibes. The * girls all reflexively duck down. * Audrey, Deadeye, and Karen run for the bathroom in the back-- * The girls rush into the tiny bathroom, which is occupied by... * Lolo, propped up high against the wall, legs wrapped around * Stephon Marbury’s face. * As the girls cram on in, Karen can’t squeeze in. * Karen is left outside as the bathroom door slams shut. As the * Police Officer steps onto the bus, Karen is going to be caught * until Todd suddenly grabs her and covers her with a blanket. * Karen is left with her face in Todd’s lap. The Police Officer * steps up, addresses the bus. * The Basketball Players all look at each other: what to say? * Todd pipes up. * The Police Officer slowly walks over, stares at Todd. * Inside the bathroom, Lolo, Stephon Marbury, Audrey, and * Deadeye are all crammed against each other. They whisper. * She reaches below frame, making heavy eye contact with him, * and they start making out furiously again. Audrey and Deadeye * both squirm, trying to avert their eyes. Audrey uncomfortably * looks towards the ceiling, only to see Lolo’s camera mounted * on the wall and pointing down at them. *  Ew, you guys were filming? * Audrey, wheels turning, points to the camera... * The Police Officer is now having a conversation with Todd as * Karen tries hard not to move... which is difficult given that * she’s sweating under a blanket, in the lap of an ex-boyfriend. * The Police Officer smiles thinly, then looks around. * The Officer turns to go. Under the blanket, Karen can’t hold * it in any longer. She SNEEZES. The Officer whips back around. * The Officer looks down at the blanket. * It’s stifling under the blanket. Karen can’t help but fidget. * The Police Officer reaches for the blanket...AND SUDDENLY, * FROM THE BATHROOM, Marbury steps out, in his tighty-whiteys, * his arms behind him. * And suddenly he whips Lolo’s camera out from behind his back * and snaps a picture, unleashing a BRIGHT FLASH which * temporarily blinds the officer. * Marbury drops Lolo’s camera, then charges down the aisle, * grabbing the Officer’s cap as he rushes out the door. * The Officer runs after Marbury, allowing the girls to burst * out of the bathroom (and Karen to emerge from Todd’s lap). * Lolo puts her camera around her neck, points at the skylight. * Todd helps the girls as they start climbing out of the raised * skylight. As soon as they’re all up, Karen turns and kisses * Todd on the cheek. * The girls climb out of the skylight and onto the roof of the * bus. Freedom! In the background, Stephon Marbury runs down the * highway as the Officer chases. As the other Officer in the car * calls for backup, the girls climb down a ladder from the roof * of the bus and start running down a side road. * The girls are in the clear. Karen looks around, realizes. *  bus-- Fuck. Fuckity fuck fuck FUCK! * Karen and Lolo start shouting at each other as Audrey tries to * get in the middle. * Finally, Deadeye whistles loudly, getting all their attention. * She holds up her phone. * Deadeye points into the village. * Deadeye looks to Audrey and Karen. Karen looks uncertain. * Deadeye shows Deng’s location nearby on her phone. Audrey * Lolo can’t help but smile as Karen reluctantly follows. * The girls walk through an idyllic water town. Ancient * buildings and shops line the streets. *  This is a cute little village. * Several people carrying a red, ornate bridal sedan chair march * past as onlookers gather to catch a glimpse of the bride in * her traditional red gown. * Audrey reacts at the mention of her “mom”... She looks around * at the charming and colorful town, at the Chinese families, at * a cute young mom and her daughter - she’s starting to warm to * the idea of connecting with her roots/mom... when a scary * SNORTING WATER BUFFALO snaps her out of it -- it’s one of many * being herded by a gruff man towards the river. *  GRUFF MAN * They turn the corner, only to see... * A flooded bridge. Muddy river water has completely wiped out * the road. Fuck. A faraway figure waves from the other side of * the river. It’s DENG. Deadeye looks up from her texts. *  That’s Deng. He can’t get across. *  He says we have to wait until the *  water recedes. * Audrey looks to the river, then back at the shore, where there * is a boathouse nearby. She points to several dragonboats * outside. * Audrey looks back at the river, wheels turning. * She looks genuinely fearful. * Karen hesitates, then looks to Audrey. * The girls approach a boat. Audrey grabs the waterproof boat * bag and sticks her adoption file in it along with everyone’s * phones and her laptop; at the last second, Lolo manages to * cram her camera in there as well. Audrey starts barking * directions. * On the shore, they see a MAN emerge past the boathouse, waving * at them from afar. * Karen waves some money and puts it into a collection box near * the boathouse. The girls push the boat onto the water as the * man continues yelling at them in local dialect, waving, * pointing at his watch, almost as if he’s warning them not to * get on the water right now... * The gang sets out across the river. Audrey is in the back, * shouting directions as they paddle. * they get there, Audrey shouts out a command. * Everyone stops paddling for a little break. Audrey looks out * onto the water. * It really is. They all take a quiet beat to admire the * scenery, take it all in. And then...the boat starts moving. * Lolo looks around, confused. *  The water’s moving. * The boat is now moving fast down the river as the water around * them churns. * Audrey stands up to quickly survey the situation. * Audrey’s oar suddenly catches the water, breaking the blade * a buoy: in front of them is the dam intake/turbine situation, * to the right is the safe zone of river overflow. Karen starts * sobbing. * The turbines are now clearly in view as the water churns even * faster. Lolo and Deadeye frantically paddle on the left side, * trying to make the boat turn right, but they’re coming up on * the fork, fast. * Audrey grabs Karen’s oar. * Audrey wraps Karen’s arms around her as the boat barrels * towards the open dam turbines. * right as they get to the buoy, timing it just so that the oars * slingshot the girls into the safe overflow zone. The boat they * were on continues through, straight into the turbines, * splitting into thousands of pieces. *  FUUUUUCK THAT WAS SO METAL! * Deadeye holds up the waterproof boat bag as Audrey and Lolo * sigh in relief. The girls have now been safely washed past the * fork, downriver, but they’re still on the open water. And now * with no boat. The girls, treading water, struggle to keep * Karen afloat. Audrey points to the faraway shore. * As the girls try to keep Karen from dipping underwater, she * begins hysterically sobbing. * But Karen is weighing down Lolo and Deadeye who’s now on the * other side of her. * HOLY FUCK. A whole herd of water buffalo (like the one we saw * before in town) is now swimming towards them. * are quickly upon them. * The girls all grab a buffalo as they ride their way to shore! * As the girls reach the shore, they tumble off their buffalo * rides. They collapse onto the ground, clothes torn, relieved, * grateful to be alive. A beat, then Audrey starts laughing. * Then they all start laughing at the absurdity of what just * happened. * All tension from before has dissipated as the girls laugh it * off. Lolo looks down, notices that her pants and underwear are * torn. * Lolo starts twerking on the ground as everyone hoots. Karen, * laughing, flips over onto her back. * ANGLE ON all of the girls staring at her, their faces shocked. * REVERSE ANGLE ON what they’re staring at: Karen’s HUGE PUSSY * TATTOO: a SCARY DEVIL that covers not only her vagina but a * large part of her entire pelvic region. Karen quickly hunches * over to cover it, but it’s too late. * - there’s no need for modesty now that everyone’s seen it. * don’t see it, just the girls’ faces, which is enough. ANGLE ON * Audrey, Lolo, and Deadeye, giddy with shock and horror. * REVEAL Clarence, on the shore, staring RIGHT into Karen’s * pussy tat. His jaw drops. Karen quickly moves to cover * Clarence holds up his phone (location sharing is on, showing * Clarence runs away, shocked. Karen goes to run after him but * given that she’s partially nude, she doesn’t get very far. * He’s gone. * From afar, we see a FISHERMAN on the shore taking a photo of * Karen, but the girls don’t notice. Deadeye checks her phone, * straightens up. * The girls all try to cover themselves, as Lolo’s young cousin * DENG approaches. * Deng gestures to a motorcycle. * As they all climb onto the motorcycle, packing in tight: * Audrey yelps as Deng revs his bike and they’re off! * The four girls, clinging to Deng and each other, whiz past the * countryside on his motorcycle. * Deng deposits the girls at the front door and speeds away to * park the motorcycle. They’re pretty dry by now after the * breezy ride, but are still a bedraggled mess. Audrey and Karen * try desperately to arrange their hair and clothes as Lolo * rings the doorbell. * Audrey still looks worried. * She and Deadeye exchange a glance as the door opens and we * The girls sit as GRANDMA and GRANDPA CHEN fuss about them. In * the b.g. dozens of ASSORTED RELATIVES are crowded into every * corner and spilling out to other rooms. Every single Chen is * chatting, laughing, smoking, yelling, and most of all * drinking. This family is full of joyous, raucous-- and okay * let’s just say it, trashy-- energy. ANGLE ON Karen and Audrey, * taking in the merry chaos. * Grandma fusses over her granddaughters: * He grabs a huge platter of fruit off a nearby table and plunks * it on Audrey’s lap. As he peels an orange for her: * Grandma yammers on, affectionately pinching Audrey’s cheek. * She presses a brimming shot glass into Audrey’s hand and * everyone toasts! Audrey throws back the shot, winces at the * baijiu, but as the relatives pat her back and cheer, we see * she enjoys being part of the family. DISSOLVE TO: * Everyone’s still partying, the dining table now piled with the * remnants of a late night dinner and of course, more liquor * bottles. ANGLE ON Lolo and Audrey, both slightly tipsy. * She takes a picture of Audrey; Audrey’s wide, genuine smile * and the scattered empty dishes with Lolo’s family in the b.g. * make it a warm, endearing portrait. Audrey scrolls through * Lolo’s photos on her camera. * ANGLE ON Karen looking at her phone, her face creased with * worry. The food in front of her is barely touched. * Lolo stops trying to argue as Karen pours a generous amount of * whiskey into a glass and throws the whole thing back. * Karen grabs the bottle and pours herself more. Lolo and Audrey * are delighted. * DISSOLVE TO LATER: The party continues. Everyone is WASTED. * Karen’s at the center of a group of Chen cousins, rapidly * taking shots of whiskey, SLAMMING each empty down. * Everyone cheers as Karen pours more shots. * Karen stares at her for a beat, then laughs hysterically, and * then Lolo does as well. They both keep drinking as we continue * the party... * Audrey is on her laptop, finishing up a work zoom with Frank. * Meanwhile, Deadeye blearily stumbles in, hung over, and starts * downing multiple glasses of water. * Frank closes his zoom. Audrey sighs, annoyed at the sight of * Beckett. Deadeye looks over. * Audrey’s surprised that Deadeye, of all people, asked, but... * Grandma Chen enters, sees Audrey. * Grandma Chen hands Audrey a beautiful traditional qipao dress. * A few of the young cousins chatter excitedly as an adorable * LITTLE GIRL scampers up to Audrey. *  LITTLE CHEN GIRL *  Pretty dress for big sister Audrey! * The girls walk through a small village, Audrey now wearing the * qipao. * The attitude is cheerful. Lolo strides purposefully, singing a * made-up song to a marching cadence: *  TIME TO FIND / A BIO MOM / GET HER *  SIG / AND THEN GO HOME / MAYBE NOT *  / MAYBE STAY / PARTY A LOT / WITH * The girls look at where Deadeye’s looking, a small, neatly- * kept house. Audrey takes a deep breath. * A beat as Audrey collects herself. Finally... * Lolo, touched, hugs her. Audrey hugs back, then heads * purposefully for the front door of the house. Lolo snaps a * photo: Audrey’s face filled with emotion as she goes up to the * door and knocks. The door opens to reveal an elderly woman, * HELEN. Audrey reacts, surprised. Helen has to be in her 90s; * way too old to be her mom. * Helen shakes her head. Audrey holds out her adoption file. * A beat as Helen flips through the file, then nods. * Sparsely furnished, but filled to the brim with knickknacks, * books, and stacked boxes...if Helen’s a hoarder, she’s at * least a very organized one. * She plunks a teapot and cups on the table and indicates for * the girls to sit down, then takes Audrey’s file into another * room. The girls sit and look around at Helen’s controlled * chaos of random stuff. *  giant display rack of empty glasses *  frames? * She’s about to get up when Helen returns with a thick file * folder of her own. She sits down, all business, opens her * folder, takes out a logbook. Finds a page. Points. * But the other girls exchange glances...they get it. Helen * sighs, a little impatient. * Lolo jumps in. * She pushes the logbook at them, points at Audrey’s page. * Helen’s warmed up now, but Audrey’s too upset to appreciate * it; she looks like she’s about to cry. * She abruptly stands, shoving back her chair, which hits a * large display case of decorative plates. Most of them fall and * shatter. * Karen drops a bunch of cash on Helen’s table and drags a * distraught Audrey out the door. Deadeye and Lolo quickly * follow. * The girls rapidly walk away from Helen’s house, Audrey looking * like she’s about to fucking lose her mind. * Audrey ignores her; she’s beginning to have a panic attack. * Audrey, in full blown panic attack now, sinks onto a nearby * bench. A few long, labored beats as she struggles to breathe. *  end, we have to find her... * The other girls see it in her face: oh shit. For the first * time, it’s not just a matter of the passport. It’s emotional. * It’s her mom. Audrey’s panic attack ramps up again... * Lolo turns to Deadeye and Karen, worried. * Lolo gently takes Audrey’s phone and pulls up her parents’ * She grabs her phone back and dials. * Back at Audrey’s bench, where a XITANG VILLAGE GUY now holds * Audrey’s phone. * They hear a muffled voice answer the phone. Xitang Village Guy * begins to speak in halting Korean. Every once in a while, he * turns to the girls and translates it to Mandarin, which Lolo * then translates for Audrey: * Audrey can barely contain her excitement at learning this new * bit of information about her mother. * Audrey’s face is tense with both excitement and joy; Karen and * Lolo are excited too. They’re SO close! As the Xitang Village * Guy continues listening and translating... * and translates to Mandarin for Lolo and Karen. If we’re paying * attention to them, we see their faces falter for a split * second-- but we’re paying attention to Audrey, whose face is * filled with hope and anticipation. Another few beats of * Mandarin and then: * Karen reacts in surprise. Lolo speaks to the guy in Mandarin * for another few moments, then: * Karen’s face is a little shocked. * Audrey’s freaking the fuck out with joy as Lolo and Karen have * a rapid-fire convo with Xitang Village Guy off to the side. * They finish and thank him; he exits as Lolo turns to Audrey, * aglow with excitement. * [NOTE: what the audience and Audrey don’t know at this point * is that Lolo and Karen have heard via translation to Mandarin * that Audrey’s birth mom is dead; before they got a chance to * decide whether or not to tell Audrey, Lolo jumped the gun and * said the mom wanted to meet her] * A beat. Everyone is at a loss, then... * We see a SLOW MOTION POWER SHOT of Audrey, Lolo, Karen, and * Deadeye walking into the airport, looking FUCKING HOT AS HELL: * they are now dressed as a KPOP GIRL GROUP. Short skirts. * High heels. Makeup and hair on fucking POINT. WIDEN TO REVEAL * they have a few other PEOPLE DRESSED IN SUITS scurrying around * them, chattering away on headsets. * As they stride through the airport, we see that Lolo’s having * a ball, Deadeye is unfazed as ever, Audrey’s nervous, but * determined, and Karen, treating this like an acting job, is * matter-of-factly killing it. All around them, people in the * airport stop to gawk, take photos...who ARE these girls? *  Deadeye, I truly do not know how * ANGLE ON one of the PEOPLE IN SUITS walking with them, who * drops his stern facade for a moment and does a cute, whispered * There are about a DOZEN “FANS” hustling along after them * through the airport, cheering and taking photos. * Deadeye’s internet friend, JAEBOCK (think Joel Kim Booster), * strides along with them carrying a tiny white Pomeranian. * They keep walking; the security checkpoint is up ahead. * Yeah, they might not have this. CLOSE ON the stern, skeptical * face of an AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICER. The girls and their * “entourage” all try not to look worried as he studies their * documents, then gestures for another officer to come over. * They look at the girls, look back at the documents... * The Security Officer studies a visibly nervous Audrey. * Audrey’s sweating bullets, about to crack-- and then Deadeye * shoots Jaebock a look. He hoists the Pomeranian menacingly and * steps forward. * ANGLE ON the girls: Karen, Audrey, and Lolo go wide-eyed in * panic: “what?!” What are they supposed to do now? But then * Deadeye produces a microphone, opens her mouth and SINGS. * Holy SHIT, Deadeye’s voice is AMAZING! The other three girls * are shocked and struggle not to show it. All around them, * people stop to listen, not even just the fake fans, now there * are real ones that Deadeye’s literally acquiring in real time. * It is a MOMENT! And the security agent lets them through! * And with that, we’re into a STYLIZED MUSICAL SEQUENCE: the * song Deadeye was singing continues as the girls strut through * security, towards their gate, stopping for photos, stopping to * wave at fans, generally behaving like kpop stars. They get on * the plane with no problem at all, settle into seats, toast * with champagne glasses... * The plane takes off... * The plane lands at Incheon Airport as the SONG ENDS. We’re in * Korea! * The girls walk through the airport. * She looks around; at all the people, the ads with Korean * products, Korean words... It’s overwhelming. * Karen gestures out at the airport doors. Audrey nervously * walks through, and suddenly... there she is. Even though there * are hundreds of people waiting in the welcome area, Audrey * zeroes in on her. A woman, MIN, early 40s, her face open and * kind, clutching a sign: “AUDREY”. Holy shit. Her mom. The two * women lock eyes, as Min smiles, gives a litte wave. Audrey * approaches. * Min beams, tears in her eyes, as she pulls Audrey into an * embrace. Audrey is overwhelmed, but hugs back. CUT TO: * Min and Audrey sit together at an outdoor cafe on a bustling * street in Seoul. Min speaks in halting English: * Off Audrey and Min, both smiling, we see Lolo, Karen, and * Deadeye watching them from a table nearby. * BACK ON: Audrey and Min, laughing warmly. * Audrey smiles, but there’s something that feels off and she * can’t quite put her finger on it. She studies Min’s face... * Awkward pause. Their first. Min smiles gamely. * Min laughs. Audrey giggles too. BACK AT THE TABLE: *  Okay, look at them. They love each * She pokes Karen, but Karen’s looking at her phone. * Lolo spots Audrey approaching. *  two are hitting it off. Karen tries to look engaged, but keeps sneaking glances at her * phone. * Audrey looks over at Karen, whose face is crumpled with shock * and devastation. * She starts to sob, flings the phone away. Audrey reaches to * grab it off the ground, and sees the text from Clarence: “Stop * texting me. We’re done” followed by a screencap from a trashy- * looking website: it’s a picture of her PUSSY TATT that the * fisherman took on shore, accompanied by text in both Chinese * and English: “GOOD GIRL GONE BAD!” * Audrey gives Karen’s shoulder a reassuring squeeze, taps off * the Clarence thread so that the tatt photo isn’t on the screen * anymore and starts to hand the phone back...then pauses. Keeps * the phone. Looks at the screen more closely. * She leans in, looking at Karen’s recent texts. One of the text * threads has a photo of Min...but under the name HEATHER CHOI. * Karen grabs her phone back. * Just then, one of the nearby rolling ads on a bus stop flashes * to an ad for sunscreen... and the woman in the ad, * enthusiastically spraying it on, is Min. Audrey runs back towards Min. The other girls follow, but it’s * too late-- she reaches Min, points to the ad. * The ad flashes, changing to something different. * Audrey steps forward-- is she about to fuck her up? “Min” * backs away, scared, and lapses into AN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT. Min quickly hustles away, squeezing Karen’s elbow as she passes her. Min’s gone. Audrey turns to her friends, red hot. Audrey whips around to look at Lolo. Lolo gapes, grasping for the words, but she can’t bring herself to say it. Finally Deadeye breaks the silence. * Audrey is stunned. Lolo finally musters the courage to look her in the eye. Audrey reacts, it’s a gut punch. A tear runs down her cheek. Lolo reaches for her, but Audrey shrinks back. * Audrey shakes her head. * Lolo’s in such fucking SHOCK that Audrey would actually say all this out loud, she can’t even defend herself. Karen steps forward. Audrey stares at her, suddenly quiet. Karen reacts, stricken. Audrey gathers her things, fuming, then turns back to Lolo. completely broken Audrey walks away. * Audrey is stalking away down the street when Deadeye runs up to her. She holds out a piece of paper. * Audrey barely even looks at her as she grabs it, continues * down the street. She’s gone. POST FIGHT MONTAGE * Over music, INTERCUT between Audrey, Karen, Lolo and Deadeye: * Audrey blankly stares at her adoption form, at the empty line * for her birth mom’s signature. She checks a box underneath * marked “Deceased”, then places the form into a hotel fax * envelope. Audrey then looks to her laptop, where work emails * are piling up. She closes it, then curls up in bed and cries. * Karen, dressed down with no makeup, sits alone on a rumpled * bed. On her laptop, several different tabs are open to various * gossip websites: a headline reads “WHERE IS CHUNHWA? HAS * SECRET WHORE GONE INTO HIDING?!”. She winces as she sees a * video clip of Clarence, head down, surrounded by paparazzi. * She goes to close the tab, but gets a popup ad for a plastic * surgery clinic -- with tattoo removal! Hmmm. She looks back to * her phone, dials, gets Clarence’s voicemail... * Lolo, depressed, posts a story to her Instagram: “does anyone * want to buy a camera? DM me for deets [string of crying * emojis]”. Deadeye sits behind a computer nearby, typing. She * perks up; she’s found something interesting. Beckons Lolo * over. * A cab pulls up to a graveyard. Audrey gets out, Deadeye’s note * in hand. The cab driver helps direct her to her birth mother’s * grave. Audrey puts down a small bouquet of flowers. * Audrey puts down another bunch of flowers at her mother’s * grave, arranging them with the flowers from the day before. * She steps to the side as she gets a work call from Frank. *  AUDREY (INTO PHONE) Frank hangs up. Audrey puts her phone away as a man, DAE, approaches Min’s grave, then looks down at Audrey’s flowers. * Curious, Audrey goes up to him. * Off Audrey’s surprise, Dae smiles. * Off Audrey and this unexpected development... It’s a warm, cozy space. Dae pours tea as Audrey looks at a few framed pictures of her birth mother. It’s the first time Audrey has seen her face clearly.  --We were only married a few years Dae looks at her; gets an idea. He puts on his glasses and goes his computer. Pulls up a few files, gestures for Audrey to look: ON MONITOR: it’s MIN, smiling nervously at the camera. She introduces herself in Korean, then: Min gestures for him to hush. It’s charming. Min smilingly chides Dae in Korean. A tear rolls down Audrey’s face, but she can’t help but smile; it’s not just her mother she’s finally seeing, but a slice of her life. Min says a heartfelt line in Korean. Audrey leans forward, what is she saying? Audrey is crying, and so is Dae. * Audrey rides in the passenger seat as Dae drives. Audrey nods, surprised. * Her voice catches. * Audrey laughs. * Lolo and Deadeye sit in the waiting area, tickets in hand for * the next ferry back to China. Lolo morosely sings another made- * up song. * Lolo’s obviously not fine. Deadeye pats her on the head. * Karen sits in front of a DOCTOR, who’s explaining the * procedure for the laser tat removal. * Just then her phone dings with a text. Karen looks to it, * confused. Then concern. * Karen rushes out. * The ferry is boarding. Lolo’s phone dings: it’s a text from * Audrey: the bat emoji. * Deadeye holds up her phone. She got it too. *  the middle of a street. And she’s *  not moving. * They run off. * Lolo and Deadeye, holding their phones, run down a busy * street. They spot Karen, doing the same. * They turn the corner, into... * A busy square. Audrey is standing in a pedestrian island. She * waves at them. As they cross to her: * She points at a nearby bus stop. The digital ad display shows * one of Lolo’s photos from their trip: it’s a gorgeous * landscape from the riverbank. *  Wait, what’s happening? * Lolo realizes that her photos are on display all around them: * on billboards, bus stops, etc. Landscapes, street scenes, a * few of the girls smiling and laughing. They’re all simple, * undoctored, and striking. People nearby look up and admire * them. Lolo’s floored. * included. Audrey reaches out and pulls them all into a group * hug. A long beat, then Lolo ear-flicks Audrey, gesturing * around to all the photos. * A packed, busy night market with tables in the middle of the * street. The girls sit at a folding table full of food, happily * eating. * A YOUNG KOREAN COUPLE approach Karen to take selfies; they * speak in Korean, but we understand “pussy tatt”. Audrey and * Lolo are surprised when Karen obliges. * Karen puts on a brave face, but Audrey senses her sadness. * Audrey’s phone rings; an incoming video call from Frank. * Audrey gets up, finds a quiet corner before answering. Audrey sees Lolo, Karen and Deadeye peering around the corner. They’ve been eavesdropping the whole time. She hangs up. The other three girls stare at her in delight.  HOLY SHIT! That was crazy!  GET THIS BITCH THE FINEST AH-BOONGS * Deadeye jumps up to go get Ah-Boongs. * Lolo takes out her camera, sets a timer. The girls pose, * holding their ice cream. FLASH! They check the picture. * But there’s a hint of a smile on her face... * ON a plaque that reads “AUDREY HAN SULLIVAN”. WIDER to see it’s a cozier, homier office. Instead of the row of awards there’s a row of PHOTOS of various young Asian children with * their birth parents. Audrey sits at her desk with a headset, on a video call to a MIDDLE-AGED KOREAN WOMAN. Even though she’s working in the dead of night, Audrey is perky and upbeat. ONSCREEN: The woman reacts, overjoyed. Audrey hugs her parents goodbye. Mary, wearing a “BONG HIVE” tee, and Joe help Audrey take out her luggage from the trunk. Mary and Joe have totally adapted to Audrey’s new culture. They wave as she takes off. Lolo hangs up some photos to dry. Her phone alarm goes off -- * time to go! * Lolo, coming out of the Tisch building with her luggage, hails * a cab. She made it to New York! * In a large banquet-style hall, servers push dimsum carts to large round tables of diners. There’s a live performance onstage: It’s Deadeye singing a sultry ballad. The crowd eats it up, applauding.  dollars each. See my mom. ON Deadeye’s dead-eyed mom, manning the merch table. Deadeye grabs her luggage and rolls out. Karen, dressed in all black with sexy makeup. * She pulls a GUN and SHOOTS a SCREAMING WOMAN! WIDEN TO REVEAL that it’s a television set. Karen walks over to the Director in video village. Karen looks over to the stage door and smiles. Clarence is there, waiting for her! It’s a wedding reception! KAREN AND CLARENCE KISS as the guests, including Audrey, Lolo and Deadeye, cheer. Karen * rushes over to them. Over hugs and squeals: Karen looks over to Clarence and beckons him over. * Clarence drops his pants, displaying a GIANT DICK TATTOO. It’s * an angel with wings that covers his entire pelvic region, and * there’s also a PRINCE ALBERT PIERCING. *  AUDREY/DEADEYE/LOLO *  AAA! / AAAA!!!!! / AAAHAHAHA!!!!!! * OVER CREDITS: Audrey, Lolo, Deadeye and Karen do a routine to Deadeye’s KPOP * SONG to the delight of their guests! *
