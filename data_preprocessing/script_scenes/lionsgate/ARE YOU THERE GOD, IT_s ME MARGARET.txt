 ARE YOU THERE GOD? IT'S ME, MARGARET  Based on the novel by Judy Blume  Written by, The first notes of Sweet Thing by Van Morrison. Warm, gentle, easy. SUMMER CAMP in the CATSKILLS. Sunlit. Glorious. Ten thousand shades of green.  The year is 1970. It could be any year. Summer camp might be the only thing that never changes. OPENING CREDITS begin to appear and disappear as we find... MARGARET SIMON (11), standing on a DOCK in her BATHING SUIT, spindly arms and legs, nose peeling from a sunburn, hair swept up in a jumble of bobby pins, growing out from a bob. She lets out a GOOFY REBEL-YELL and does a AWKWARD JUMP into the LAKE, arms and legs flailing. A DOZEN 11-YEAR-OLD GIRLS do their own funny lake-jumps after her, one after another, like dominos. They all come up from the water, LAUGHING. A COLLAGE OF IMAGES: The girls singing CAMP SONGS, firing and misfiring ARROWS, clopping through a stream ON HORSEBACK, whispering in BUNK BEDS, blowing out MARSHMALLOWS by a CAMPFIRE, all squeezed together with their arms around each other by a “CAMP EAGLE LAKE” SIGN. A BRIGHT LIGHT FLASHES, capturing a PHOTO of it. All of the girls grinning, carefree, unaware yet of their bodies, their crooked teeth, the dorky haircuts they’ll soon regret. KIDS. They break apart. Margaret and the other campers HUG and do stupid handshakes goodbye. She climbs aboard the NEW YORK-BOUND CAMP BUS among a LINE OF BUSES here to shuttle all the girls back to the cities they came from. Margaret looks out the bus window at bucolic New Hampshire, saying goodbye to the best summer of her life. A labyrinth of STEAL AND CONCRETE, swarming with people. Margaret’s BUS lumbers through traffic, making a wide slow turn towards UNION SQUARE, packed with WAITING PARENTS. Margaret gives more goodbye-hugs as she makes her way out of the bus, scans the sea of faces for her mom. BARBARA SIMON (30’s) -- hair frizzed from the heat, anxious to please, polite to a fault -- weaves through the crowd, brightening as she spots Margaret. She waves both hands, her fingers stained with paint, a wrist coil key chain jammed with too many keys. Margaret runs over, HUGGING her. Barbara squeezes her hard. They pull Margaret’s CAMP TRUNK out of the BUS’S CARGO HOLD. They awkwardly schlep the trunk over to the Simon’s new CHRYSLER NEWPORT, a humongous land-yacht idling in the road. Margaret’s Grandma, SYLVIA SIMON (60’s), coiffed red hair, a vibrant dominating force, the kind of woman to keep on your good side, climbs out of the passenger seat. Margaret drops the trunk, runs to hug her. Barb watches their love-fest, dragging the trunk the rest of the way herself. Margaret reaches inside a GIFT BAG, pulls out A HAND-KNIT SWEATER, reads the LABEL. Barb is hurrying to find the key to the hatch on her massive wrist coil when she overhears this, looks up at Sylvia: WTF? She gives Margaret a secret look: But between you and me: Jewish. A CAR HONKS behind them, TRAFFIC stacking up. Margaret rushes to help Barb hoist the luggage in the trunk.  (then lays on horn LOUDER) Margaret, Barb, and Sylvia carry the camp trunk up a FLIGHT OF STAIRS, each holding a corner, sweating. Barb strains to hold her end with one hand, searching through her big wad of keys again with the free hand. Sylvia rolls her eyes, knowing this will take a while. Tiny, hodge-podge, lovingly cluttered, Barb’s CANVASES and ART SUPPLIES stacked around in piles. IN THE BEDROOM, HERB SIMON (30’s), natural born salesman, can’t go anywhere without making 50 new friends -- changes out of his suit from work, bouncing in his socks to the beat of I Wonder Why by Dion and The Belmonts. He hears the FRONT DOOR swing open, and heads into THE LIVING ROOM, sees the women lumber in and drop the trunk, out of breath. He rushes over, feeling guilty. He gives Margaret a hug, says hello to Barb and his mom. They both laugh. She points to SOME CARDBOARD BOXES stacked up in the corner. Margaret FREEZES. Looks at Sylvia. What? Barb and Herb exchange a look, can’t believe it. Margaret tries to catch up, hoping she’s hearing this wrong. Barbara scrambles to soften the blow. Margaret is still disoriented, barely hearing them. Margaret’s eyes bug out of her head. Barb and Herb can’t believe Sylvia did it again. Sylvia puts her hands up, guilty. She puts herself in a TIME-OUT across the room. Margaret begins to spiral, retreats to a chair, trying to process this. Barb struggles to regain control of things. Sylvia helplessly mimes her commiseration. Barb looks to her mother-in-law for help. Barbara gives up, kneels down in front of Margaret, trying to get through. Really talk to her. She takes Margaret’s hands in hers, earnest, trying to convey what’s really at the heart of this. We can see just how bad Barb’s felt. Working mother’s guilt oozing from her. Barbara feels herself get a little emotional at the prospect of finally being the kind of mother she’s seen on TV. Margaret manages a nod. No other choice. Barbara draws her in for a hug. Herb joins. They embrace in a little clump. Barb looks over at Sylvia, still in time-out across the room. Sylvia heads over, joining their hug. It’s a sweet moment. Their HUG BREAKS APART. We stay on Margaret’s face as the adults go at it again. It’s late now, the New York skyline twinkling yellow, the streets a relative quiet. We take Margaret in from outside her window. She stands near the glass, uneasy, looking out at the city she’s leaving. She peers around her room, the knot in her stomach tightening, her eyes starting to fill up. She looks over at the HANDFUL OF BOXES that have already been packed for her. She lets out a deep exhale, desperately hoping somebody heard this prayer. The CHRYSLER is packed up, idling at the curb. Sylvia and Margaret hug each other goodbye, both gutted about this. Margaret nods somberly. Herb puts his arm around Sylvia, squeezing her goodbye. Sylvia doesn’t quite believe it. They pile into the car. Herb looks back at his mother standing alone on the curb, forlorn. Feels badly. He walks over to give her one more hug. Herb smiles, teasing her. She rolls her eyes. He gives her little a kiss on the head, goes back to get behind the wheel. As they pull way, Margaret gives Grandma one last goodbye out the back window. Sylvia gives her an air-kiss, Margaret give one back. Sylvia stands there watching them head off to their new life without her, their car finally disappearing. She looks around at the city. For the first time, she’s alone in it. SALE, junk spread out on a lawn. Kids in bathing suits on BIKES, yelling as they chase an ICE-CREAM TRUCK. A tree-lined street of quaint, almost identical homes baking under the summer sun. The Simons’ new residence is a CHARMING BRICK 2-STORY, the shutters and front door freshly painted black. Margaret arranges LITTLE HOMEMADE CERAMIC ANIMAL FIGURINES she made with Barb, trying to build a new life for herself here. She looks around the room -- it’s filled with all the same stuff from her old room, but it doesn’t feel like home. A disaster of BOXES and PACKING PAPER. Barb finishes unpacking a CRATE OF BOOKS into a BUILT-IN BOOKSHELF, looks around the room to see what’s next. It’s overwhelming, she’s barely made a dent. She wipes away some SWEAT, SNIFFS her armpit to see if she stinks. Margaret comes down the stairs, catching her in the act. Margaret makes a face. Margaret raises an eyebrow, not looking forward to that. She pulls an OLD CRUSTY MODEL SAIL BOAT out of a box. Why did they even pack this? The DOOR BELL rings. Margaret crosses the FOYER, opens the FRONT DOOR to find a girl in a swimsuit with her hands on her hips. This NANCY WHEELER, 11 going on 17, overflowing with confidence. Margaret goes back inside to Barb. Barb brightens a little, glad Margaret’s already making friends, their move working out as planned. Barb looks at the big mess, no clue where one would be. They turn to see Nancy has let herself inside. Nancy points through the window at her better house. Barbara smiles crookedly. Interesting kid. Nancy and Margaret head across the street. Nancy notices Margaret’s bad posture. Margaret looks over, not sure what to say. Nancy demonstrates her forward-thumb, chest-out posture. Margaret tries it, walking stiffly upright next to Nancy.  Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 14. They step into-- It’s full of EXPENSIVE ORNATE FURNITURE WITH CLAWED FEET. POSTERS OF HEART THROBS peppered with Nancy’s lipstick kisses, a DRESSER loaded with BOTTLES OF NAIL POLISH and TANGLED COSTUME JEWELRY, a HEART-SHAPED MIRROR with “Nancy Wheeler” scrawled a million times on the glass. A stark contrast to Margaret’s patchwork childlike bedroom. * Nancy gets a BATHING SUIT out of a drawer, tosses it to Margaret. Margaret pauses, a little self-conscious. Margaret starts to change into the suit. Nancy sits on the edge of her bed, staring right at her as she does. Margaret turns around, carefully pretzeling herself so as not to reveal her body. Margaret’s cheeks flush. She yanks up the suit. Nancy sticks her chest out to demonstrate. Margaret raises an eyebrow. Nancy looks relieved. Nancy picks up her pillow, opens her mouth wide and gives it a LONG KISS, gently stroking the pillow’s “hair” and “back”. It goes on for uncomfortably long. Margaret can’t help but laugh. Nancy frowns, embarrassed. Margaret’s not sure she does. Nancy opens a DRESSER DRAWER with a MILLION COSMETICS inside. She runs a HAIRBRUSH through her long hair. Margaret touches her mess of bobby pins, self-conscious. Apparently Nancy notices everything. MRS. WHEELER (30’s), tan with big breasts and curled hair, WASHES a LITTLE DOG in a TUB. The girls come out with their towels. Mrs. Wheeler cocks her head, waiting for more. Mrs. Wheeler stops scrubbing the dog, surprised. Margaret feels a little put on the spot. Nancy cranks on the SPRINKLER. She dances through the water. Jumps, spins, cartwheels. Margaret copies her move for move, trying to keep up. Nancy pretends to run in sexy slow-motion like a girl from a movie. She pouts her lips, runs her fingers through her wet hair. Just then, A BIG HARD BLAST OF WATER nails her in the face. Nancy’s brother EVAN (14), pudgy and freckled, holds the HOSE, laughing with his friend, MOOSE FREED (14) handsome with big brown eyes, a foot taller thanks to a recent growth spurt. Nancy runs off to tattle. Both boys look at Margaret. She quickly grabs the TOWEL, covering herself, thinking about the naked girls comment. She smiles, trying to seem normal. Evan rolls his eyes, leaving Margaret with Moose. Moose lifts up his arm to wipe some sweat, revealing a TINY TUFT OF ARMPIT HAIR. Margaret stares at it a sec. She shifts her weight, feeling nervous around him. Moose bends down, picks up the Wheeler’s FALLEN BIRD FEEDER, carefully hangs it back on its HOOK. Margaret watches, transfixed. She nods. There’s a tiny flutter in her belly. She grins at him. Then worries the grin is too much, tries for something more casual. It’s not great either. Nancy walks Margaret back home. Margaret decides she better not say how she really felt about him. They stop in front of her HOUSE. Margaret swallows, already feeling rejected. Nancy waves and skips off, leaving Margaret with that. Margaret stands there a moment, feeling her anxiety rise. Margaret organizes her SCHOOL SUPPLIES, thinking. Then-- She looks at her METICULOUS DESK. It’s not helping at all. She gets up from the chair, starts to pace a little. She draws a quick little circle around her flat chest. Feels a little embarrassed putting it so bluntly to God. Then suddenly: The SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall. Barb hurries in, carrying a bunch of RANDOM JUNK in her arms, still getting through the unpacking. Barb tosses MARGARET’S BATHING SUIT onto her bed. Margaret’s eyes dart quickly at her chest again. Barb puts an OLD ELECTRIC PENCIL SHARPENER on her desk. Barb nods, exiting again. MORNING LIGHT streaks across the Simons’ front lawn, GLISTENING WITH DEW. A perfect image. A DIGITAL ALARM CLOCK goes off, wrecking it a little. BARE FEET wriggle into a PAIR OF BROWN LOAFERS. Margaret steps in front of the mirror for a look at herself. Takes a deep breath, anxious. Barb has the kitchen almost in order, down to the last items. Herb hurries to gobble some TOAST, running late. Margaret walks in, hunched in her new blue jumper, her toes pointed self-consciously inward. Herb gives Barb a squeeze before rushing out. Barb pours Margaret some cornflakes, senses her anxiety. Barbara realizes her pep talk is going the wrong way. Then-- Margaret rolls her eyes a little, not in the mood to be lectured. A LAWN MOWER ENGINE starts up next door, suddenly JOGGING MARGARET’S MEMORY. She leaps up from her seat. Barb turns around, not sure what the commotion is. Margaret runs to catch him. Herb is already in the car, backing out of the driveway. He sees her racing towards him, rolls down the window. Herb starts to back out again. Margaret starts back towards the house, finds Barbara waiting for her in the doorway. Margaret sighs, annoyed. Barbara puts up her hands, not wanting to be a nagging mother. First day chaos. Tons of TRAFFIC and WANDERING KIDS. Margaret limps up the front steps through the MAIN ENTRANCE, her sockless feet throbbing. She pulls down the heel of her shoe to see a HOT RED BLISTER FORMING. She sucks it up, puts her thumbs forward, trying to walk the way Nancy showed her. She spots ROOM 18 up ahead. Margaret enters, peers around for Nancy. Her eyes scan everyone’s FEET. Socks, socks, socks. Then finally: NO SOCKS. She pans to see the feet belong to Nancy. Margaret hurries over, relieved. Nancy checks her feet. GRETCHEN POTTER (11), Jewish, chubby, opinionated-- waves. JANIE LOOMIS (11), skinny, soft-spoken, African American, smiles. NORMAN FISHER (11), ill-fitting button-down, bed-head, thick glasses with a string, sits off by himself. Margaret looks over at a CLUSTER OF BOYS entering the room. PHILIP LEROY (11) instantly stands out, casually great- looking, sun-kissed from a summer of waterskiing. Philip takes a seat next to his friend, FREDDY BARNETT (11), a SHORT REDHEAD with an EXTREMELY BAD SUNBURN. Margaret notices a TALL ATTRACTIVE WOMAN entering the room. They all turn to look. Margaret looks again, feeling dumb. LAURA DANKER (11), looks at least 16 thanks to her HEIGHT and HUGE EARLY BOOBS. Margaret reacts to “feel her up,” not used to peers talking like this. She watches Laura take a seat by herself in the back row. A THROAT CLEARS. They turn to see their new teacher, MILES J BENEDICT (20’s) -- starched shirt, neatly combed hair. They all quiet down, sit up straighter as he walks to the front of the class. He writes “MR. BENEDICT” on the chalkboard. He chuckles at his joke. They all just stare at him. He clears his throat again. Looks down at a SWEATY SCRAP OF PAPER tucked inside his palm, his INTRODUCTION speech written on it. “Benedict. Like the eggs. And because it’s egg-cellent to meet you. (Pause for laughter.)” He looks back up at their blank faces. Holds in an ocean of nervous diarrhea. Margaret feels a little sorry for him. He writes on the chalkboard: “I love...” “I hate...” “I’m looking forward to...” They all take out paper and get busy writing. Nancy slides a NOTE to Margaret: “Secret club meeting today. 3pm, my house. NO SOCKS!!!” Margaret nods dutifully, passing it to Janie. Sylvia finishes watering TWO LITTLE BAMBOO PLANTS sitting in her window sill, then sits at the kitchen table, not sure what to do next. She looks at the phone, then looks at her watch. Margaret’s not home for several hours. The KITCHEN is done now. Barb finishes wiping the counters, goes into THE LIVING ROOM to see what’s left to do. Just one BIG STACK OF BOXES remain, carrying all her ART STUFF. PAINT BRUSHES, PAINTS, CANVASES, HER OLD ARTWORK. She pulls out a few of her PAINTINGS. Eyeing some of the older ones, she’s surprised by her reaction to them: She likes her own work. She’s talented. Two endorsements she always hesitates to give herself. She leans a few of them against the walls to be hung up later. Then glances around the room, trying to figure out where to put all of her art supplies. She opens the HALL CLOSET: already stuffed. Peaks in the LAUNDRY ROOM: Too small. She slides the ART BOXES into a CORNER next to a RUSTY FAN and a BOX OF YEARBOOKS. Something about putting this stuff here makes her a little sad. The end of a long-held part of herself. But she brushes off the feeling, goes back into -- As Barb comes into the room, she suddenly notices something hadn’t until this moment, FROWNS. The TATTERED LIVING ROOM SET from their New York apartment has seen better days, and also looks RIDICULOUSLY SMALL in their vast new suburban den. Just comically out of proportion. Hmmm. This will definitely not work. The PHONE RINGS. Barb crosses get it. INTERCUT with Sylvia at her apartment, dusting her furniture to pass the time.  Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 28. A beat as Sylvia waits for the few minutes to pass. Then she realizes she should probably small-talk with Barbara. Barb can’t help but laugh at her guilt trip. Sylvia’s not kidding. The door opens behind Barb and Margaret * hurries in. * Margaret instantly perks up, drops her bag, runs to grab it. Sylvia looks crestfallen, secretly hoping it’d be bad enough they’d all move back. Margaret agrees, hangs up. A sound indicating “I don’t know, maybe it’ll be okay, maybe it’ll be a truly hellish nightmare, we have to see.” Barbara gets her meaning. Margaret hurries for the door. Nancy, Gretchen and Janie sit around the patio table eating Oreos, LAUGHING. Margaret arrives through the back door, wishing she weren’t the last one to get here. She finds a seat at the table, reticent. Gretchen cups her hands to show the size of Laura’s chest. Margaret quickly nods in agreement, trying to catch up to where they are in the conversation. Margaret crosses her legs, trying to seem cool. Her SHOE falls off. She quickly leans down and puts it back on. Margaret gets a little uncomfortable at the word “period”. Janie does too. They share a look. Margaret’s never even thought of checking the bins. Suddenly they’re all looking at her, waiting for a response. She couldn’t be more relieved. Nancy bangs her COKE CAN on the table like a gavel. The energy in the room immediately shifts. Margaret crosses her arms over her non-existent chest. They all love that idea too. The room tingles with excitement at the prospect of this kind of sharing. Margaret smiles, starting to feel like part of the group. She’s at the beginning of a whole new chapter. RAINBIRDS spray a GRASSY PARK. Herb organizes his RECORDS in a COOL RECORD STAND now that he has enough room to showcase his collection, Peggy Lee’s Fever playing, absently singing along.  Peggy” and she goes “Okay.” But Margaret’s not listening. She’s studying something, her BROW FURROWED, chewing her fingernails. REVEAL: THE JC PENNEY CATALOGUE, opened to the BRA SECTION. She has it tucked inside her HISTORY BOOK, angled so nobody but her can see it. How is she going to broach this? She looks over at her mom. Barb is in THE KITCHEN looking at a PHOTO in a RECIPE BOOK: A JUICY GOLDEN BROWN CHICKEN nestled in a clump of crispy potatoes. She looks over at HER OWN VERSION: A LIMP GRAY WATERY CARCASS floating next to BURNT BLACK POTATOES. It’s somehow both overcooked and under-cooked. She puts a PIECE OF PARSLEY on top of it, trying to make it look more like the picture. Margaret climbs in bed, her mind still on the bra, Barb dropping off some FOLDED LAUNDRY from a basket on her hip. Barb looks back at her. Margaret tries to bring up the bra. Barb makes her way to the door, SHUTS OFF THE LIGHT. Margaret regrets not having the guts. Just before the door closes-- Barb freezes. Margaret covers her face, mortified. Barb turns the LIGHT BACK ON, a little dumbstruck. Unprepared for this conversation. She treads lightly. Margaret shoots her a mom hurt look. Barb realizes. Margaret chews her lip, feeling so weird about this. She can’t stand to keep talking about it. Margaret nods, just wanting this conversation to be over. Barb walks out, pulls the door shut behind her, just stands there a moment, realizing she’s just entered a whole new phase of motherhood. Is she ready for it? INSIDE, Margaret still cringes. She drums her face, trying to knock the feeling out of her head. School in session, kids in class. Barb hurries inside, running a little late. Pokes her head into the PTA ROOM, making sure she’s in the right place. A FEW DOZEN WOMEN mill around. Hard to tell whether she means it in a good way. Barb finds a chair. Mrs. Wheeler gets up behind the PODIUM, quiets everyone down. Barb RAISES HER HAND. A few other women do too. Mrs. Wheeler nods, grateful. Barb RAISES HER HAND AGAIN. Why not. Nobody volunteers for that one. Barb RAISES HER HAND A 3rd TIME. Mrs. Wheeler gives her an approving little nod. Barb smiles, feeling good about this. The class finishes a MATH WORKSHEET. A stop watch BEEPS. Mr. Benedict clicks it off. The class perks up, paying attention. The whole class GROANS. This is the good news? He waits for their expressions to brighten at the prospect of such autonomy. They all complain even louder. Mr. Benedict sputters, not expecting this. Freddy flicks a PAPER FOOTBALL at him. THE BELL RINGS, thank god. They all pack up to leave. Mr. Benedict gestures to Margaret. Margaret looks taken aback. Did she do something wrong? Margaret swallows. Janie gives her a concerned look. As the kids clear out, Margaret approaches Mr. Benedict’s desk. She reluctantly sits. Mr. Benedict shuffles through papers. He looks up, suddenly seeing how nervous she is. He offers her his little JAR OF CANDY CORN. Margaret loosens a little. He takes a piece of CANDY CORN for himself. She watches him chew it for a moment. Margaret shifts in her seat, put on the spot. Mr. Benedict absorbs this with curiosity. His curiosity begins to pique her own. That is pretty interesting now that she thinks about it. Margaret nods, still thinking about her grandparents. A SALVATION ARMY TRUCK idling out front. Barbara tries to wrap up a phone call with Sylvia while THE SALVATION ARMY GUYS carry out their OLD FURNITURE. Sylvia’s in her APARTMENT, standing next to a PORTRAIT OF HERSELF. Barbara’s losing patience. One of the GUYS hands Barb the DONATION RECEIPT. Margaret walks in just as they’re leaving. The men exit and she closes the door, crosses to the SECRETARY DESK to file it. Barb’s posture changes, caught off guard. Barb slides the receipt into a FILE FOLDER, thrown off- balance by the question. Barb’s not sure how to handle this. She steadies herself, weighing it. Margaret looks at her, really wanting to know. Barb can tell she’s not getting out of this. Now Margaret is even more interested. Barb releases a breath, has out with it. Margaret furrows her brow, not getting it. Barb tries to explain. Retelling this story, Barb can’t help but feel those old emotions rising up in her. Margaret doesn’t understand. Barb realizes she has to phrase this more clearly. Margaret is pinned to her chair. Heartbroken for her mom. She moves towards Barb, wrapping her arms around her to comfort her. Barb feels herself choke up a little, then wills it back, not wanting Margaret to take this on, uncomfortable feeling their parent-child dynamic reversed. Barb gives her a little pat, reassuring Margaret she’s okay. Barb smiles resiliently, determined to lift the mood. Barb stands to find her purse and keys. Margaret’s head is still whirling. They drive to the mall. They near the entrance of the store. Barb holds the door open for an absurdly long time, letting a whole parade of people go into the store before her. They float up the ESCALATOR. At the word “BRAS,” Margaret instantly SNAPS INTO THE PRESENT MOMENT, abandoning her conversation with God. She eyes the MANNEQUINS IN LINGERIE, suddenly very uncomfortable. Barb leads them through THE UNDERWEAR DEPARTMENT up to a SALES LADY (60’s), cat eye-glasses, built like a baked potato. Margaret immediately stares at her shoes, pretending to know nothing about this. The lady sizes up Margaret’s chest. Margaret just about dies. Margaret reluctantly follows her to the REGISTER. The lady loops a TAPE MEASURE around her chest, puts a 2ND PAIR OF GLASSES over her cat-glasses to see the number. Margaret’s really starting to resent this lady. Margaret and Barb step into a STALL. Margaret quickly takes the bra, turns around the opposite way to slip off her shirt, awkwardly fumbles with it, getting hung up in the straps. Barb adjusts the straps, clasps the back. Margaret slowly turns around, feeling extremely exposed. Margaret wiggles her shoulders, pumps her arms. The weekend in full swing. Neighbors weeding their yards, washing their cars, kids playing freeze tag. Barb gets the MAIL, sees her FURNITURE CATALOGUE has arrived. Flips through it a bit at the curb. Then looks up to see Herb rolling his NEW POWER LAWN MOWER onto the grass. She laughs. Herb unbuttons one of his shirt buttons, starts the motor with extra manly flair. She bites her lip, pretending to be turned on. He pushes it across the lawn like a stud, popping a wheely. Just out of the shower in a BATHROBE, Margaret heads into-- She closes her curtains and gets some UNDERWEAR out of her drawer, pulls it on, then pauses, suddenly noticing something different. She bends over, looking closer. Her eyes widen. Hairs. She pretzels her head down closer, squinting at them. Not bad. She pulls the GRO-BRA out of LORD AND TAYLOR BAG, rips the tags off, wriggles into it with much effort. Then turns to study herself in the mirror. Flat as a board. She turns sideways, pulls her shoulders all the way back, pushing her chest out as far as she can. It makes no difference. She sighs, frustrated. Thinking, she gets two BALLED UP PAIRS OF SOCKS out of her top drawer, stuffs them into each cup. They’re ridiculous and misshapen. It doesn’t matter. She absolutely loves them. She walks cat-like around the room, feeling them out. She puts on one of her RECORDS: Chica Chica Boom Chic, by Carmen Miranda. Begins to DANCE around the room, swinging her sock-boobs back and forth, playing the bongos on them, her and her boobs becoming the star of their own music video. Suddenly, there’s a SCREAM from the front yard. Margaret startles, yanked back into reality. She runs to the WINDOW, looks out it to see Herb next to the lawnmower with a VERY BLOODY HAND. Herb’s hand is BANDAGED UP now, embarrassed by his blunder after making so much fanfare. Barbara reads the LAWNMOWER DIRECTIONS to find out what went wrong. Margaret squeezes past them carrying a GLASS OF WATER and a NOTEBOOK towards the backdoor, already excited about the silver lining: MOOSE IS CUTTING THE REST OF THEIR GRASS NOW. She puts the water down for him. He waves thanks. She takes a seat on a LAWN CHAIR, opens the LITTLE NOTEBOOK, where the words Boys I like are written & underlined at the top. The four girls sit in a circle on the floor. Margaret opens her LITTLE NOTEBOOK, where she’s listed just one boy: Moose Freed. A LITTLE HEART by his name. Nancy walks behind each girl, feeling their backs for a bra strap. Margaret is so relieved she’s not the only one. Nancy puts her shoulders back, proud. They all look at her, impressed. Nancy stands, demonstrating. Nancy pumps her arms back and forth, flexing her pecks. Margaret and Janie exchange a look, hoping so. They all stand up, pumping their arms along with her. They all squeeze. Margaret squeezes harder than anyone. Suddenly, the BEDROOM DOOR SWINGS OPEN. Evan and Moose burst in, LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY. Margaret is mortified. Nancy chases them out of the room, slapping at Evan. Margaret is still cringing about what happened with Moose as she hurries with her parents to catch the BUS to NYC. Margaret gets on the bus, the doors closing behind her. Barb suddenly regrets this, second-guessing her parenting. Just then, a CRAZY HOMELESS LOOKING PASSENGER bangs on the side of the bus through his open window, yelling for the bus to MOVE. He flicks his CIGAR BUTT onto the tarmac. Herb smiles at Barb. Margaret takes a WINDOW SEAT BY HERSELF in the back, staying away from the WEIRD GUY. Margaret looks over to notice TWO NUNS sitting across the aisle from her. She breathes a sigh of relief. Then considers-- Margaret waits a sec, as if for an answer. Something inside her responds in the affirmative. She shakes her head. She looks out the window, feeling resolved. Ten times more crowded than New Jersey’s terminal. Margaret stands on her toes, looking for her grandma, finally spots Sylvia, who’s a BLONDE now. Sylvia sprays her with a CAN OF DISINFECTANT. Sylvia whisks her away. Sylvia and Margaret climb out of a CAB, head up the steps towards THE ICONIC FOUNTAIN and MASSIVE COLUMNS all lit up. A COUPLE VIOLINISTS playing Dance of the Little Swans. 20 BALLERINAS spin in unison, performing SWAN LAKE. Sylvia and Margaret watch them, in awe. Margaret slips out of her flats to stretch her feet. Sylvia slides her high-heels off too, wiggles her stocking feet over to Margaret’s to give them a “kiss.” They smile at each other. Margaret and Sylvia stroll through NYC after the show, goofing around pretending to be ballerinas. The WAITER sets TWO COMICALLY HUGE CHOCOLATE PARFAITS and a couple SPOONS in front of Margaret and Sylvia. Margaret laughs. They dig in. Sylvia makes a little gesture at her own good-sized bosoms. Margaret grins a mile wide. Sylvia and Margaret are in nightgowns now, crawling into BED, Sylvia rubbing her face and hands with a MENAGERIE OF CREAMS lined up on her nightstand. They crawl under the covers. Sylvia switches off the LAMP. They lay in the dark for a sec. Sylvia’s EYES SNAP OPEN, she SITS UP, flips the LIGHT BACK ON, wide awake suddenly. TONS OF PEOPLE dressed to the nines. Sylvia leads Margaret towards the entrance, still ecstatic about this surprise twist of fate. As they pass the GREETER-- The GREETER nods politely, not caring at all. They find their seats. Sylvia waves to more people. Margaret smiles hello at everyone, not quite sure how to act. Sylvia spots THE RABBI walking up to the PODIUM. The MUSIC BEGINS, signaling the service is starting. Sylvia squeezes Margaret’s arm. Margaret sits up straighter, a little anxious. Sylvia hands her a PRAYER BOOK. Margaret opens it backwards. Sylvia flips it around for her. Margaret already feels lost. He keeps going in Hebrew. Margaret glances at Grandma for a translation, but Sylvia’s Hebrew ends at “Shabbat Shalom.” Margaret tries to follow but her eyes glaze over. She starts to glance around the room and COUNT HATS. Margaret tries to focus again. The CANTOR sings, there are more prayers, more rituals, more Hebrew. Her posture begins to sags. TIME CUT: Margaret JOLTS, as if woken from sleep. Everyone stands up, the service over. Sylvia smiles. Sylvia hugs her as if she’s officially jewish now. Margaret’s a little disappointed. But Sylvia puts her arm around her, thrilled. Barb unloads the DISHWASHER, upset. Margaret puts away the silverware. Herb pulls a TV DINNER out of the oven. Barb LAUGHS. Margaret feels mocked, shuts the silverware drawer, leaving the room. He does a little jig to Aint That A Shame by Fats Domino, trying to change the mood. But Margaret keeps walking. Herb shrugs at Barb. He tried. She sighs, worried maybe she handled that badly. Herb sits down with his TV DINNER on a LAWN CHAIR he’s set up in front of the TV since they still don’t have furniture. Barb looks at him, feels like she’s failing as a wife too. Herb waves it away. No big deal. He gestures to his lawn chair, reclined to the 3rd notch. Barb laughs. This is why she gave up everything for him. Moose rakes FALL LEAVES off the Wheelers’ grass. Mrs. Wheeler sets a TRAY OF ICED TEA on the COFFEE TABLE. Barb and THREE OTHER MOTHERS ON THE CAMPUS IMPROVEMENT COMMITTEE sit in the den. Barb takes a sip. A LEMON SEED gets in her mouth. She awkwardly spits it in her hand, embarrassed. She looks around, not sure where to throw it away. Mrs. Wheeler reaches out a hand. Barb drops it into her palm, feeling like a child. Mrs. Wheeler takes it to the trash, comes back. She smiles, very pleased with herself. The women wait in suspense. Mrs. Wheeler holds up a FELT STAR she cut out as an example. They all coo at that adorable image. Mrs. Wheeler puts SEVERAL BOLTS OF LIGHT BLUE FELT and FOUR PAIRS OF SCISSORS in front of them. Barb blinks. ON THE BLACK TOP, WESTERN MUSIC plays, all the kids awkwardly SQUARE DANCING for P.E. Mr. Benedict reads the dance calls, way out of his comfort zone. The kids are clumsy and terrible at it. Norman Fisher keeps stepping on Margaret’s feet. Margaret gives Janie a look expressing her annoyance with Norman. Janie rolls her eyes, commiserating. The BELL RINGS, thank god. As the kids disperse, Nancy hurries over with Gretchen in a tow. She has a shit-eating grin on her face. Nancy nods for Gretchen to show them. Gretchen slyly unzips her bag, giving them a peek: A HUMAN ANATOMY TEXT BOOK. All the girls’ eyes get big. Margaret fidgets, nervous, feeling like an accomplice to a crime. C.U.: A DETAILED DRAWING OF THE MALE BODY, INCLUDING PENIS. The girls hover over it silently, taking it in. Margaret swallows. Checks the door again just to make sure no one can come in. HER DESK CHAIR is shoved in front of it. Gretchen flips the page to the book’s real gold: A CLOSE-UP DRAWING OF A PENIS AND TESTICLES. They all get very quiet again. Nancy grins. She was waiting for that reaction. Margaret shakes off a visual of naked Evan. Margaret suddenly regrets revealing that. All of the girls look at her. Margaret feels the pressure. Margaret tip-toes down the hallway, glances downstairs to check the coast is clear, sees Barb busy cutting out FELT STARS, a STRIP OF MUSTACHE BLEACH on her lip, standing by the TV watching a COOKING PROGRAM, hoping to learn something. Margaret continues down the hall to-- She slips inside, surveys the room. Tries the MAGAZINE RACK. Then Herb’s NIGHTSTAND. No dice. She kneels down, looks under his side of the bed. Bingo... The WHOLE STACK. She takes one, quickly stuffs it under her shirt. The girls are all huddled behind Nancy as she opens the magazine, turning it long-ways so the CENTER FOLD UNFURLS. Their eyes adjust to the image. Margaret laughs. Gretchen gives her a look. Margaret zips her lips. They all look at each other, desperately hoping so. CUT TO:  INCREASE OUR BUST! Off their PUMPING ARMS-- ANOTHER SET OF PUMPING ARMS, clapping rhythmically. A GOSPEL CHOIR, harmonizing with a A BADASS 80-YEAR-OLD LEAD SINGER/PASTOR, tearing it up with his killer pipes. Margaret stands with Janie and her FAMILY, clapping along. Margaret looks around, trying to feel out if this is “it.” It’s great, but she’s not so sure. JANIE’S MOM smiles over at her, making sure she’s having a good time. She gives Margaret a little shoulder squeeze. Janie elbows Margaret, nods at an OLD WOMAN a few seats over, DEAD ASLEEP IN THE PEW despite all the action. They both laugh. The street is BURIED UNDER A FOOT OF SNOW now, all lit up for the holidays. CHRISTMAS LIGHTS, NATIVITY SCENES, PLUG-IN MENORAHS glowing in windows. The Simons is the only dark house on the block. Out front, Moose finishes SHOVELING THEIR WALKWAY before he loses the light, the last house on his route. Margaret watches from her bedroom window as he clears the last bit of now, then slings the SHOVEL over his shoulder to begin his walk home. Barb sits at the table in her sweats and slippers, filling out “HAPPY NEW YEAR” CARDS. She looks at her ADDRESS BOOK for the next name on the list: “PAUL AND MARY HUTCHINS,” an OHIO ADDRESS... HER PARENTS. She pauses seeing it. Can’t help feeling a prick of sadness. Then, on an IMPULSE she can’t explain, she reaches for a BLANK CARD and scrawls out: “Dear Mom and Dad, I hope you’re both well. Love, Barbara.” She stuffs it into an ENVELOPE, licks and seals it before she can change her mind. Margaret comes up behind her. Barb turns around, startled. Then notices out the window behind Margaret-- Barb scoops up the stack. Margaret takes it, hurries out the door. She rushes down the walkway, the MAILMAN already leaving. He turns around, waiting for her. She sprints down to hand him the cards. Just as she does, she catches the name on the top envelope: PAUL AND MARY HUTCHINS. She freezes. Blinks. The mailman hands her the day’s MAIL in exchange. Margaret’s mind is still on card, until something even more unusual catches her eye: A PIECE OF MAIL ADDRESSED TO HER. Who in the world would send her a letter? She tears it open. Come on over for a PARTY! Norman Fisher’s 12th Birthday She rolls her eyes. What a let down. Barbara is reading the invitation now, Margaret scrounging in the fridge, eating DELI MEAT from the package. The PHONE RINGS. Margaret picks it up. Margaret’s expression is somewhere between panicked and thrilled. Her view of this party just changed dramatically. Margaret frantically scours her closet, searching for something to wear, scared nothing is good enough. In QUICK CUTS, we see EACH OF THE GIRLS GETTING READY: They paint their fingernails, untangle costume JEWELRY, squeeze into TIGHTS, spritz perfume, shampoo, blow-dry, straighten, curl. They’re ON THE PHONE WITH EACH OTHER THE ENTIRE TIME, anxiously comparing notes. (The images are in direct contrast to the summer camp ones only months ago. Female self-consciousness has arrived in its full shitty glory.) Margaret sits on the closed toilet seat in a BLUE VELVET DRESS, her knee bouncing nervously as Barb curls her hair. She points at a jagged curl sticking sideways. Barb tries to flatten it down. It doesn’t work. Margaret scurries out of the bathroom, licking her fingers and trying to fix the curl. Herb passes her in THE HALLWAY. Margaret just rushes past him to her room, too nervous to hear a compliment. He shrugs it off, knowing he’s superfluous right now. She hurries through the door, finds her KITTEN HEELS in the closet, slips them on and crosses to the FULL LENGTH MIRROR for a last look. She likes her hair. Likes her shoes. Likes the dress. Then she looks at her chest. Frowns. Just as she says that, an IDEA begins to form. Margaret closes the door behind her, a little scared about what she’s about to do. She opens the medicine cabinet, gets out the BOX OF COTTON BALLS... Then stuffs 3 into each side of her bra. She turns to see herself in the mirror. Her eyes light up, absolutely blown away by the improvement. SFX: Mrs. Wheeler’s CAR HORN. Nancy screaming Maaaargaret! Margaret realizes it’s time to go. Reaches in her bra to take out the cotton balls. Then...an IDEA. A radical one. She acts on it: Walks out the door, taking the cotton balls with her. Barb and Herb wave goodbye from the front door. Margaret climbs into MRS WHEELER’S STATION WAGON, squeezing in next to the GIRLS. She still can’t believe what she did. A large, modern home. MRS. FISHER (30’s) sequined party blouse, opens the door. They all follow Mrs. Fisher inside. Janie squeezes Margaret’s arm, nervous for their big entrance. They clomp down the stairs to the PARTY. Streamers tacked up. MUSIC playing. The boys have congregated one side of the room, girls on the other. Janie and Margaret exchange another look, not sure what they’re supposed to do with themselves. Seeing this is his cue, Norman picks up a spoon, TAPS IT ON HIS PUNCH GLASS. It’s too full and the punch sloshes out, dribbling down his pants. He tries to sop it up with some cocktail napkins. His mother gestures for him to forget the stain and focus on the speech. Norman lifts the SERVING LID from A FANCY SILVER PLATTER to reveal the BEANIE-WEENIES (CUT UP HOTDOGS FLOATING IN BAKED BEANS). The kids peer at it wearily. Norman senses it. He points to the SANDWICHES and NUTS. Freddy Barnett grabs a plate, goes for the beanie weenies. The rest of the kids start to follow. Margaret, Janie, Gretchen and Nancy eat at a card table. Margaret’s eyes are on Laura Danker, standing on the other side of the room, the BOYS side, alone with her arms crossed. Margaret can’t help feeling oddly fascinated by her. Gretchen laughs. Good one. They all turn to look at Philip Leroy. He’s bent over, sucking MUSTARD off his plate with a straw. He aims the straw upwards, blows hard, making a BIG YELLOW SPLOTCH on the ceiling. They both crack up. Nancy grins. Norman TAPS HIS PUNCH GLASS again. Everyone looks around. What kind of games? CUT TO: An EMPTY BOTTLE LAID SIDEWAYS on the floor. Norman spins. All the girls get nervous, hoping it doesn’t land on them. It lands on Janie. Margaret shoots her a sympathetic look. Janie swallows. Norman walks over, gives her a peck on the cheek. Except he misses her face, gets her hair instead. Janie looks sick. Norman does it again, connecting this time. Janie spins. It twirls and twirls. Then lands on...Norman Fisher again. Everyone LAUGHS. All the kids get a little nervous imagining this. Margaret and Janie eye each other: Should we be doing this? CUT TO: Nancy holds a BASKET OF LITTLE NUMBERED PAPERS, the room tense with anticipation. She holds the basket out to Freddy. He pulls one out. Everyone looks around to see who 3 is. No one responds. Laura Danker slowly stands up. She towers over Freddy, her chest at his eyeballs. Freddy turns bright red. Margaret can’t believe it. Philip grins, slapping him on the back. Everyone LAUGHS. Margaret can’t take her eyes off Laura as the two of them go into the BATHROOM. They close the door. The whole room goes SILENT, listening. Gretchen shuts up. A few seconds pass. Finally, the door opens. Laura comes out, arms folded tightly over her chest, flustered, Freddy behind her. Everyone HOOTS and CLAPS. Freddy hands the basket to Philip, traumatized. All the girls sit up, hoping Philip picks their number. Nancy prays so hard she could burst. Nancy’s shoulders fall. Everyone looks around to see who 12 is. Margaret stares down at her number: 12. Margaret is still frozen. Philip does a crooked little smile at her. All the girls burn with envy. Margaret slowly stands, heart banging in her chest. The whole room watching intensely as they head towards-- Philip goes in first. Margaret follows, hardly able to breathe. She slides the ACCORDIAN DOOR shut, all the kids eyes on her until the last inch of it closes. She’s about to turn around and face Philip when suddenly it dawns on her: The cotton balls. Her eyes widen, her hands reflexively fly up to her chest. She realizes where her hands are, quickly drops them. Nothing she can do about it. She swallows, slowly turns around. She gulps a gallon of saliva. Before she can finish, his LIPS ARE ON HERS. She’s stunned, completely unready. He pulls away, looks at her. Margaret can’t move. Then he leans in again, kisses her a second time. This one is LONGER and SLOWER. When he finishes, he grins, proud of that one. Margaret is frozen in her spot. He walks past her OUT OF THE BATHROOM. Standing there alone, a shocked little smile forms on her face. She looks down at her COTTON BALL BOOBS, then up at God, grateful. The bathroom fills with PRE-LAPPED CHURCH ORGAN MUSIC. A LADY (90’s), thick glasses and puffed hair, hunches over the CHURCH ORGAN, playing. Margaret watches from a pew, the same goofy smile still on her face. Nancy is next to her, sick with jealousy. Nancy looks miserable. Margaret can’t help but gloat. Margaret shakes her head, amazed by her good fortune. Winter is fading. Just dirty patches of ICE now. Barb is still cutting out FELT STARS, starting to get really sick of this task. She’s on the PHONE, trying to fundraise. She hangs up. Cold-calling is not her strong suit. Then, something OUTSIDE THE WINDOW catches her eye. It’s A GOLDFINCH perched on a twig, yellow feathers catching the light just so. The image is so beautiful it breaks through something, reaches a place deep down inside her. On instinct, she drops the scissors, hurries out to-- Barb runs to her BOXES OF ART STUFF, rushes to get a CANVAS, EASEL, PAINT, PAINTBRUSH. She rushes back into the house. By the grace of God, the bird is still there. She sets up the canvas as quickly as she can, squeezes out a blob of PAINT, begins to make the first delicate strokes, when-- DING DONG! The doorbell rings. The goldfinch startles, FLYING OFF. Barb’s shoulders drop, genuinely disappointed. She sets down her paint brush, crosses through the DEN, opens the front door. Mrs. Wheeler is outside. Mrs. Wheeler scans Barb’s appearance: undone hair, grubby house clothes. Barb feels it, reflexively smooths her hair. Mrs. Wheeler follows Barb into the DEN, looks for a place to sit. But HERB’S LAWN CHAIR is still the only seat, now joined by other make-shift furniture: an OVER-TURNED BUCKET as a side-table, an UPSIDE-DOWN CRATE as a footstool. Barb gets the HUMONGOUS BOX from the dining room. Barb nods, walking Mrs. Wheeler out. She closes the door, rolls her eyes at herself: God, what’s wrong with me, why can’t I get it together? ALL THE 6th GRADE GIRLS are gathered in the auditorium. ON STAGE IN THE WING, MRS. WEBSTER (50’s) in a boxy gray suit and orthopedic shoes, vigorously cleans her nostrils with a handkerchief. Then stuffs it in her pocket, clears away some throat phlegm, walks out ON STAGE. A few GIGGLES in the crowd. Margaret and the girls look at each other. Everyone looks at Laura Danker. She lowers her head. Margaret sinks down in her chair, sure all eyes are on her now. The LIGHTS GO DOWN and THE FILM begins: Images of GIRLS flashing on screen, all shapes, sizes, and colors. THE TITLE CARD comes up: “What Every Girl Should Know”  area, and it is now that she begins An animated UTERUS and OVARIES appear. The REACTIONS to the film vary dramatically: thrilled, fascinated, grossed-out terror-stricken, exhilarated, genuinely bereft. Janie laughs. Nancy eyes Margaret, laughing. Margaret folds her arms, embarrassed and stung. Margaret follows Barb through ROWS OF MODERN JETSONS-LIKE FURNITURE, still thinking about Nancy’s joke. Barb stops. Whoa. Left field. She gets up from the chair, trying to transition herself into a conversation she didn’t anticipate at this moment.  Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 78. Margaret doesn’t see the humor. Barb glances around the store, giving up the “modern” look. Just too weird for her. Margaret, Nancy, and Janie huddle over their MATH HOMEWORK, cross-checking answers. Nancy nods. Okay then. Gretchen runs up, breathless. They all just look at her, confused. They all freeze. Holy shit. An emergency meeting to discuss this development. Nancy gestures to her Double A’s, feeling gypped. They all look around, trying to remember that smell. Janie looks suddenly grief-stricken. Margaret is mesmerized. Margaret’s insides twist with envy, wishing so badly she could feel that feeling. Margaret kneels at her bedside, hands clasped in prayer-pose, vomiting out a prayer, top-speed. She lays back on her carpet, exhausted. Something in the room catches her eye: THE LITTLE HANDMADE ANIMAL FIGURINES her dresser. Their childishness suddenly make her sick. She stands up, scoops them all up, drops them into a junk drawer, slams it shut. ANGLE ON: A SHELF FULL OF MAXI PADS, TAMPONS, PANTY LINERS. Reverse to see: Margaret and Janie stare intensely at it. But Margaret is extremely nervous too. She gathers her courage, plucks a BOX off the shelf. Janie wills herself to take one too. They hurry towards THE REGISTERS. They see the CASHIER: a SWEET LOOKING LADY (50’s). They breathe a sigh of relief. Just then, a PIMPLY 17-YEAR-OLD BOY changes shifts with her. Margaret pulls Janie towards the register, determined. They walk up, set their TWO BOXES OF PADS on the CONVEYER BELT as casually as possible. The TEENAGE CLERK looks down at the pads, then up at them. They fold their arms, look away. He presses the button to roll the pads closer to him. It’s THE SLOWEST CONVEYER BELT IN HISTORY. Margaret and Janie watch, sweating, as the pads inch slowwwly by. Margaret finally can’t take it, grabs some TIC TACS, tosses them down with the pads so they aren’t alone. Margaret and Janie burst out of the store, RUNNING AS FAST AS THEY CAN AWAY FROM IT. It’s SNOWING outside. They stop at the corner, out of breath. Look at each other, traumatized. Janie suddenly begins to LAUGH. Margaret shakes her head, LAUGHS too. It’s all so ridiculous. They loop their arms around each other, heading home, SNOWFLAKES floating down around them. CLOSE UP ON: A MAXI PAD. Margaret turns it over in her hands. Squishes it. Smells it. REVEAL: She’s crouched INSIDE HER CLOSET with the door closed. She peels off the paper strip, touches the sticky part a couple times. Then stands up, yanking down her pants. She hunches over, carefully sticking the pad in place. Then pulls up her pants again, WALKS OUT OF THE CLOSET. She moves around the ROOM, feeling it out. Stretches, kicks, squats. It feels like wearing a small diaper. Suddenly there’s KNOCK and the DOOR SWINGS OPEN. Margaret stiffens in an awkward pose. Barb cocks her head a little, sensing something’s off with Margaret. She lets it go, hands her the post card, exits. When the door closes, Margaret flips it over. Nancy’s written just 3 words: I GOT IT! Margaret’s mouth drops open. Her mood plummets. In one spontaneous flurry, she tears up the card, hurls the pieces into the trash can, KICKS it over. Sylvia is in her nightgown, digging in her closet, a half- packed SUITCASE open on her bed, along with BROCHURES for a FLORIDA VACATION. The PHONE rings. She goes to get it. She immediately knows something off in Margaret’s voice. Margaret is crouched on the floor of the BATHROOM, the door shut, the PHONE CORD stretched as far as it will go. It’s too hard to explain. Sylvia clutches her heart. Then does a silent fist pump. Sylvia doesn’t quite want to say she’s going on a vacation to find friends, but she is. Margaret’s expression falls. Sylvia feels rotten, hating to let her down. Margaret perks up a little. Margaret feels her spirits lifted a little. The sky is a pretty purple. The Wheeler’s STATION WAGON idles out front. Margaret opens the door to get in. She’s dressed up, her hair curled. MR. WHEELER (40’s)is behind the wheel in a suit, Mrs. Wheeler is all dolled up in the passenger seat. Margaret scoots in. Looks back to see Moose sitting with Evan in the THIRD ROW, which FACES BACKWARDS out the rear window. Moose turns around, waves. Margaret buckles in, the back of her head an inch from the back of Moose’s. Physically closer than they’ve ever been, but facing complete opposite directions. Their proximity makes her feel a little tingly. A SOLD OUT SHOW packed with TOURISTS. The LIGHTS GO DOWN as they find their seats in the FRONT ROW. Margaret looks to see where Moose is sitting. He’s in the FARTHEST SEAT AWAY. Bummer. The CURTAIN OPENS. They all face forward as THE ROCKETTES run out, burst into their BIG OPENING DANCE NUMBER. Margaret and The Wheelers tilt their heads way back, the front row too close to the stage. HIGH-HEELED LEGS swish past them, almost too close for comfort, a view right up their skirts. Nancy squeezes Margaret’s arm, giddy. HOSTESS shows them to their seats, Nancy and Margaret still singing the music from the show. Nancy makes a face. He’s such a stick in the mud. They come to a LARGE ROUND TABLE. Margaret is smarter this time, strategically maneuvering into THE SEAT NEXT TO MOOSE. He puts his napkin on his lap. She does too. LATER-- The group is half-way through dinner. As Moose cuts his steak, his hand bumps Margaret’s. He drinks the last sip from his WATER GLASS. She scoots her WATER towards him. He thanks her, takes a big drink, then looks at her a moment, realizing something. Whatever it is, she cannot wait to hear it. She tugs Margaret away, killing their moment. Margaret reluctantly follows Nancy, frustrated. The SOUND of Nancy peeing in the stall. Margaret waits at the sink, annoyed. Margaret folds her arms, impatient. Then-- Nancy’s tone is panicked. Margaret walks over to the stall. Margaret tries to open the stall door, worried. It’s locked. Margaret can tell this is something really serious. Margaret races over to Mrs. Wheeler. Mrs. Wheeler drops her fork, stands, alarmed. Evan, Moose, and Mr. Wheeler look at each other. WTF? Evan shrugs it off, reaches over and forks Nancy’s REMAINING STEAK, moving it to his own plate. Margaret and Mrs. Wheeler stand outside Nancy’s stall.  MRS. WHEELER Mrs. Wheeler nods. Margaret gathers her skirt up, crawls under. INSIDE, Nancy sits on the toilet, her face buried in her hands. Margaret unhooks the lock, pushes the door open. Margaret goes over to wait by the sinks, worried. Nancy chokes back her tears, finally WHISPERS SOMETHING. After a moment, Mrs. Wheeler cracks open the stall door. Margaret just stands there, confused. Margaret suddenly realizes Nancy was lying about her period. She gets the PAD from the dispenser, gives it to Mrs. Wheeler. After a moment, Nancy and Mrs. Wheeler come out of the stall. She leaves. Nancy looks at Margaret, not sure what to say. They wash their hands in silence. Nancy exhales, relieved. Margaret doesn’t know how to feel. Margaret and Nancy ride back, sitting far apart. Margaret glances over at Nancy, then stares out her window, lets out a SIGH. The station wagon gets on the TURNPIKE back to New Jersey. SPRING now. Grass and flowers fighting their way back. Margaret raises her arm, sniffing her armpit. She doesn’t smell anything. She’s almost a little disappointed. She yanks the LID off a NEW STICK OF DEODORANT, applying it anyway.  BARBARA (PRE-LAP) Barb and Herb watch as Margaret opens her GIFT: A PLANE TICKET TO FLORIDA. She hugs them both, so relieved to finally have something good happen in her life. She needs this trip, bad. Margaret walks into class, sees ALL THE DESKS HAVE BEEN REARRANGED. She looks over at Janie, who’s holding a BALLOON and RECORD ALBUM wrapped in a BOW. They look traumatized to be separated. Janie hands her a RECORD ALBUM, trying to lift the mood. They hug, but it still feels like a somber occasion. Margaret looks around to find her new seat. Sees her name in the “BELGIUM” group. Right beside Norman Fisher. She rolls eyes. Of course. She sits down next to him. He smiles. He inches her chair away. Just then, Laura Danker takes the seat across from her. Margaret can’t believe her bad luck. Seriously, God? There’s one seat left. Who will it be? She sees Philip Leroy stroll up. She perks up, everything suddenly better. She smiles. Philip PINCHES her hard on the arm. He gestures at her flat chest. Margaret blinks, shocked, stung, pissed. Philip grins at Laura, checking out her boobs. Margaret bursts into her room, hurls down her backpack.  with her great big chest “oooh look  and Mr. Benedict with his dumb  he reads with his lips flapping all She crumbles onto her bed, spent. A cloudy day, the sky threatening to rain. Margaret and Laura are surrounded by BOOKS ON BELGIUM. Margaret is in a truly awful mood. Laura doesn’t say anything, just keeps working. Laura regrets telling her that. Laura gives her a look. Margaret jots down some more info on Belgium. Laura sees what she’s writing. The LIBRARIAN (70’s) looks up from her post. Laura slams her book shut, stands up. Laura grabs her backpack, hurries towards the exit. It suddenly hits Margaret that Nancy might’ve lied about Laura too. She gathers her stuff up. Laura won’t turn around, just keeps walking. Margaret finally catches up with her. Margaret doesn’t know what to say. Laura’s throat tightens. Laura turns away, walking off again, not wanting Margaret to see her cry. Laura runs up the steps of the CATHOLIC CHURCH, disappears inside, leaving Margaret alone on the sidewalk. Margaret stands there a moment, feeling awful. Not sure what to do. She heads up the steps, following Laura into the church. It’s dim, with towering stain glass windows. Margaret looks around. No sign of Laura. She slowly makes her way down the aisle, peering up at the ceiling, a mile high, feeling very, very small in this place. Her eyes wander to the BURNING PRAYER CANDLES. Then to a STATUE OF MOTHER MARY, staring down at her, arms outstretched, as if to gently scoop her up. The SOUND of a DOOR CREAKING OPEN. She spins around to see Laura coming out of the CONFESSION BOOTH. Margaret ducks behind a pew, watching Laura cross the sanctuary and leave. She stands again, stares for a moment at the small door Laura came out of. She begins to move towards it, step by step, until she’s right there in front of it. Then slowly, anxiously, she opens it to see what’s inside. A dark, empty space the size of a phone booth. Margaret debates a moment, then decides to go in. She sits on the small stool, pulls the door shut. She looks around the tiny space, her breath held tight in her chest. Is this where God is? In here? She waits for something to happen. A Presence to arrive. Or a feeling. Something real and true and unmistakable. Margaret STARTLES, not expecting that. A SHADOW shifts beyond the screen beside her and she realizes a PRIEST is there. Her eyes dart around, not sure what to do. Margaret has no idea how to bare her soul to another person the way she does to God. She can’t do it. Flings open the confessional door, runs out. Margaret hurries down the church steps, spilling her heart, confessing. It’s beginning to LIGHTLY RAIN. She sighs, defeated by herself. Barb runs to get the MAIL in the RAIN. As she steps into the foyer, she sees the RETURN ADDRESS on one of the letters: PAUL AND MARY HUTCHINS, Ohio. She stops. Her spirit melts right out of her body. She opens the letter, shaking as she reads it. Barbara waits as Herb READS the letter. Herb sets it down, slowly peels off a pair of reading glasses. Barb waits, breath held, for his response. For the first time, he is not his jovial self. She lowers her voice, a little embarrassed. She really doesn’t. Herb gets to his feet, begins to pace, trying to keep a lid the swell of emotions rising up. Barbara genuinely considers this question. Herb slowly inhales and exhales, accepting it even though he doesn’t like it. Barb reaches for his hand, knowing this can’t be easy for him. Margaret walks through the FRONT DOOR, registers the energy in the room. Barb and Herb exchange a look about how to handle this. Herb makes a decision-- Margaret looks at Barb, she takes the letter, quietly reads through it as Herb and Barb wait. Then: Barbara nods. Barb doesn’t say anything. Herb looks down. Barbara tries to calm her down, defuse this. Barb goes over to the PHONE, dials. Margaret cannot believe this is really happening. Herb rubs his forehead, wishing it wasn’t. Sylvia wears a BATHING SUIT and SARONG. She carries a CHEESE PLATE out to her VERANDA, setting it down in front of MORRIS BINAMIN (70’s) a good-looking white-haired gentleman pouring them each a GLASS OF WHITE WINE. She’s uncharacteristically nervous. Yanks at her bathing suit top a little, worried about her cleavage. Mr. Binamin smiles, he raises his glass, toasting to their little date. The PHONE RINGS inside. She laughs nervously, then turns around, making a face at herself for being insane around him. She answers the phone. Barb struggles for how to begin. Margaret can’t take it, goes over and yanks the phone away. Margaret hates hearing herself say those words. Sylvia’s expression falls. Sylvia’s posture changes. Margaret hands the phone to Barb. Barb hangs up before Sylvia can protest. Margaret heads up the stairs, upset. Barb looks at Herb, feeling bad for him too. He puts up his hands. It is what it is. She looks at their EMPTY DEN, suddenly realizing she’s also completely unprepared for having her parents. Barb heads up the sidewalk, Margaret reluctantly following. On their way into the store, Barb notices A GOOD-LOOKING COUPLE staring at a FANCY FURNITURE SET IN THE STORE WINDOW. The PLANE lands, her grandparents arriving. Margaret has a bitter, cheerless expression as she and Barb wait for her grandparents to de-board a PARKED PLANE. Barb wears a stiff tailored dress unlike anything else she owns, her stomach in knots. She looks over at Margaret. Margaret just looks away. Every bit of this is unfair. Barb suddenly spots her parents. Her stomach drops. Margaret looks over to see them coming down the PLANE’S STAIRS. MARY HUTCHINS (70’s), soft white hair, ruffled blouse, black orthopedic shoes. PAUL HUTCHINS (70’s), plaid shirt, suspenders, the identical shoes as Mary. Barb feels a jolt of emotion seeing how much they’ve aged. She breathes it away. The Hutchins look up, coming over towards them. Barb doesn’t know whether to hug them. The moment to decide passes. Margaret pastes on a smile, trying to be polite. Mary gives her a stiff kiss on the forehead. Margaret tenses as she does. Paul just sticks with a pat on the back. Barb tries to act breezy. Herb waits by their idling Chrysler in a shirt and slacks, a fresh haircut. He sees them approaching. Herb smiles, anxious but trying to be his affable self. Paul puts out his hand. Herb shakes it. Herb gestures to their SHITTY SURROUNDINGS, making a joke. Paul and Mary take him as sincere, look around to take in the scenery, nodding. Herb gives Barb a look. Margaret cringes a little. They all come through the front door, Herb carrying Paul and Mary’s bags. She leads them into the LIVING ROOM, now furnished with the SET FROM THE STORE WINDOW. Mary nods in approval. Barb smiles, relieved. Barbara looks at Margaret to take them upstairs. She doesn’t want to, but goes along. They’re being so nice, it’s hard to be mad at them. She softens a little. Barb opens a CAN OF CAMPBELL’S CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP, dumping the grey gelatinous blob onto a RAW CHUCK ROAST. She checks the RECIPE. That’s it, just one ingredient. She can’t mess it up. Herb comes up behind her, checking on her. Herb files it away. Then: DING DONG, the DOORBELL rings. They both look at each other. Who could that be? Herb opens the door. SYLVIA AND MR. BINAMIN are on the porch. She points to a YELLOWING PLANT on their front step. Barbara comes around, freezes. Sylvia smiles casually, as if this isn’t the slightest bit nuts. Barb is speechless. So is Herb. Margaret comes downstairs with her grandparents, sees Sylvia. Margaret runs down to hug her. Sylvia makes a big show of it for Barbara’s parents’ benefit. Paul and Mary aren’t sure what’s going on. Barb just throws up her hands. They all sit around the dinner table. Sylvia is on one side of Margaret, Mary on the other. Everyone is trying to be on their best behavior. Everyone agrees it’s great. Margaret nods too. They all look at Mr. Binamin. He smiles. Barb and Herb both react to the Hebrew. Sylvia puts the glass down and nobody can think of what to say for a second. Herb turns to Paul and Mary. Barb and Herb clean up from dinner, relieved to have a break from the group. Margaret sits on the couch opposite Paul and Mary. Sylvia and Morris are on the other side of the room, helping themselves to some ICE TEA and a TRAY OF DESSERT COOKIES. They look at her with a genuine longing for the years they missed. Margaret can feel their sincerity. Margaret’s smile falters, not expecting that. Sylvia overhears it, interjects. Mary smiles tersely at Sylvia, staking her own territory now. Margaret couldn’t look more uncomfortable. Margaret looks over at Sylvia. Herb and Barb walk in from the kitchen to hear this. Can’t believe their ears. Barbara can’t believe they’re doing this. Margaret sinks down in her seat, desperately wanting out of this room. Herb finally has enough, seizes control.  RELIGION UNTIL MARGARET DECIDES As they argue, we push in on Margaret’s face. Finally, something vital inside her BREAKS. All the adults shut up, stunned. Margaret rushes out of the room, hurries UP THE STAIRS. She throws her DOOR shut, about to give God a piece of her mind. Then stops, realizing it’s useless anyway. He’s not even there. The adults just stand there, regretting how that went, no one sure what to say now. Dark now. The glow of street lights. Barb and Herb see Sylvia and Mr. Binamin off in one TAXI, her parents off in another. Everyone seems exhausted. Sylvia looks apologetically at Mr. Binamin, worried her family drama turned him off. He pats her reassuringly. Barb and Herb watch both cabs drive off down the street. Barb sighs. Herb loops an arm around her: Well, just us again. Margaret switches on a SMALL DESK LIGHT, pulls some PAPER and a PEN out of her DRAWER, begins to write. She hesitates, scared of what she’s about to write next. Something empties out of her eyes. Margaret walks to school by herself. She looks tiny. A tuft of dust blowing down the road. Students drop BOUND BOOKLETS into Mr. Benedict’s INBOX. Margaret waits at the edge of his desk as he finishes reading her LETTER. He looks up at her, worried for her. A knot forms in her throat. She tries to swallow it away, but can’t. She rushes out of the room before anyone see her cry. Margaret barrels down the hallway, trying to outpace her emotions. A TEAR escapes. Then another. And another. She starts to RUN, makes a turn into-- She races by a GIRL AT THE SINK WASHING HER HANDS, ducks into the last stall, shuts the door, crouches down next to the toilet, THE TEARS COMING HARDER AND FASTER NOW. She clamps a hand over her mouth, trying not to make a sound. She SOBS -- a SILENT, shaking little heap. The GIRL exits, the SOUND of the door shutting behind her. Finally in private, Margaret unclamps her hand, lets herself cry. She finishes and the bathroom becomes VERY STILL. She pulls in a long, slow breath, steadying herself. Presses her scrunch sleeves against her eyes to sop them up. Finally, she rises to her feet, exiting to-- As she comes out the door, the LUNCH BELL RINGS. HUNDREDS of KIDS rush in from all directions. Margaret watches them for a moment. Then folds in with the crowd, CARRYING ON. Sun sinking behind the trees. CLOSE UP: The LATCH on the UNDERSIDE OF THE DINING ROOM TABLE that holds in the EXTRA LEAF. Two FINGERS reach into frame, popping it open. Barb struggles to lift the HEAVY WOOD PIECE from the center of the table, drags it across the carpet, leans it against the wall. She pushes the two side pieces back together to turn it back into a SMALL ROUND TABLE. She stares at it a beat. Her own family seemed to expand and contract just that fast. She takes a slow breath, trying to be okay with that. Behind her, the DOOR OPENS. Margaret walks in from school with a tired, far-off expression. Barb can relate. Margaret nods hello, heads for the stairs. They just stand there. Margaret doesn’t make eye contact. You got that right. Barbara gestures to the couch. Margaret isn’t sure. Barb takes a seat, hoping she’ll follow. Margaret hesitates, then joins her. They sit quietly beside each other a moment. Barb looks over at Margaret, Margaret looks over at her. The moment is ripe. Margaret cracks a tiny smile. Looks down. Barb’s heart aches seeing her like this. Margaret nods. Yes. Yes, it does. Barb nods back, knowing the feeling well. She loops her arm around her. Their heads tip together ever-so-slightly. Summer again. Trees swaying in a warm breeze. Emerald green grass. Sprinkler mist sparkling in the sun. GLOWING PAPER LANTERNS strung up over the blacktop. BOOTHS set up with FOOD and GAMES. Margaret leans together with Janie, Nancy, and Gretchen in front of a “CONGRATS GRADUATES” PHOTO BACKDROP. She’s a little better now, but something is missing from her smile. MR. BENEDICT snaps their PICTURE. Nancy breaks their huddle, takes off running. Gretchen and Janie run after her. Margaret almost falls in with them, then decides against it. She just can’t go along with Nancy’s ever whim anymore. She looks over at Mr. Benedict. He’s checking in with her after what happened. But Margaret smiles, meaning it. Mr. Benedict bows his head, the compliment getting in. Someone TURNS UP the MUSIC on the stereo system. A BUNCH OF KIDS make a run for the chalk-drawn DANCE FLOOR. Margaret watches them dance for a moment. Then something just beyond them catches her eye: LAURA DANKER, standing by herself as always. Margaret leaves Mr. Benedict, walks up to her. Laura looks over, surprised someone’s talking to her. Laura hesitates, not sure if she’s for real. Margaret looks at her, earnest. Laura weighs whether to trust it. She takes the leap. They head over to the dance floor, start to dance together. Nancy hogs the game, Gretchen nagging for a turn. Janie looks around for Margaret. Spots her across the way, dancing with Laura. Surprised, she watches them a sec. They look like they’re having more fun than she is. She looks over at Nancy and Gretchen bickering, decides to join Margaret and Laura. The 3 of them DANCE in a little circle, at the beginning of something... A small BRICK BUILDING nestled on MAIN STREET. CLOSE UP: A PAINTING OF A BOWL OF FRUIT, still in progress. A YOUNG GUY adds a shadow under a pear. The guy nods, grateful. Barb moves on to the next student. Barb walks to her car after work. Mrs. Wheeler comes down the sidewalk with some shopping bags. Mrs. Wheeler shakes her head at the dumb rule. Barb smiles, nods. Beat. How does she put this? Barb smiles again, apologetic. Mrs. Wheeler blinks, taken aback by the honesty. Barb slides into her car, waving goodbye. As she spins around to back out, she has a private moment celebrating her tiny victory on the road to self-acceptance. Margaret is on the PHONE with Sylvia (in her APARTMENT). Sylvia looks over at Mr. Binamin sitting drinking coffee in his pajamas. He MOVED IN with her. Margaret hangs up, goes into the LIVING ROOM, where Barb some last items into her CAMP TRUNK, filled to the brim. (Behind her, we see the living room now includes a DEDICATED CORNER for her painting stuff). Barb swings the lid down. Margaret climbs on top of it, using all her weight to push it. Barb secures the latches. They high-five. Margaret hears the LAWN MOWER START UP, looks out the front window. Barb’s figured out she likes Moose. Margaret turns to Barb, her face lit up, thankful for the excuse. Margaret finds Moose making laps with the mower, singing Erie Canal to himself. Moose waves. She holds up the BILLS. He turns the mower off. They walk towards each other. She just nods and smiles for a moment. A dumb grin forms on Margaret’s face, not expecting that. Moose smiles, walks back over to this mower. Margaret turns around and heads back towards the house, glowing. Margaret climbs the stairs two-by-two, grinning to herself. She skips down the hall, ducks into-- She pulls down her shorts, sits down to pee, still smiling, replaying what he said. She gets up front the toilet, suddenly FREEZES, seeing something. Her eyes get as big as dinner plates. For a second, she can’t breathe. Then-- BARB is DOWN THE HALL, putting some TOWELS into the LINEN CLOSET. She startles, rushes down the hall, worried. Sticks her head into the BATHROOM. Margaret looks up at her, can’t believe what she’s about to say. Barbara doesn’t know what she means for a se. As she says the words aloud, she starts to LAUGH AND CRY AT THE SAME TIME, short-circuiting from all the emotions. This is wonderful! This is awful! It’s such a relief! I’m so scared! I’m finally growing up! Oh god I’m not a kid anymore. Barb starts to choke up too, then LAUGHS, feeling silly about all these emotions. Margaret laughs. Barb hurries to get the BOX from a HALL CABINET, comes back with the PAD for Margaret. Margaret grabs the pad away. They both start laughing again. Barb closes the door, steps into the HALLWAY to give Margaret privacy. Margaret peels the paper off the pad, presses it against her underwear, pulls up her shorts. She can’t believe she’s doing this for real. She turns to look at herself in the mirror. Thrilled and a little scared by the new person staring back at her. She draws in a breath, letting it all settle in. Then, a tiny little thought arrives. It hovers there, crumb-sized. Her eyes tick up to the ceiling. THE SCREEN GOES BLACK. We hang for a moment in the darkness. Then: END CREDIT MUSIC BEGINS. THE END.
